<h2>PUBLISHERS’ NOTE.</h2>

<p><i><b>This book is entirely original.</b></i> It is the work of a
single author, who has made the subject of games a life-long
study, who keeps in touch with all new games, and with changes
in old games. He has written the description of each game expressly
for this book.</p>

<p>The treatment is systematic and uniform. The description of
each game begins with the apparatus and the players, and then
follows the natural course of play, step by step, until the end.
Each part of the game is described in a separate paragraph, and
every paragraph is preceded by catch-words in heavy-faced type,
so that the entire work is in the nature of a dictionary, in which
any part of any game can be found immediately.</p>

<p>All technical terms are accompanied by a full definition of
their meaning, and are printed in full-face type.</p>

<p>All disputed points have been settled in an entirely original
manner. Instead of taking any one person as an authority, the
history of each game has been traced from its source to its
present condition, and its rules have been carefully compared
with those of other members of the same family. The times
and the reasons for the various changes have been ascertained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
and the rules given are not only in strict accord with the true
spirit of the game, but are based upon common sense and equity.
When official laws for any game exist they are given in full.</p>

<p>The list of technical terms is the most complete ever published.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>The word “Hoyle” has gradually come to stand as an abbreviation
for an “Encyclopedia of Indoor Games.” The common
expression, “played according to Hoyle,” usually means “correctly
played,” or “played according to the standard authorities.”
The original Edmund Hoyle wrote on very few games, but his
work was the first attempt to put together the rules for the
most popular indoor games in one volume. Although Hoyle died
more than a hundred years ago, his work has been constantly
added to as new games came into vogue, which has led many
to believe that he is the authority for games that he never heard
of, such as pinochle and poker.</p>

<p>Persons who have never given the subject much attention
may be surprised to learn how little authority there is for the
rules governing the majority of our popular games. If we
except the table games, such as chess, checkers, billiards, backgammon
and ten pins, and such card games as whist, bridge,
auction, and skat, all of which are regulated by well-defined
codes of laws, agreed upon by associations of prominent clubs,
to govern championship contests, etc., we have very few games
left which are not played in different ways in various localities.</p>

<p>This is undoubtedly because such games are learnt at the card
table and not from books. A person who is shown a new game
cannot remember all its details, some of which may not have
been explained to him even. If he tries to teach it to others
while his knowledge is in this imperfect state, he will naturally
invent rules of his own to cover the points he has forgotten,
or has never learnt, usually borrowing ideas from games with
which he is more familiar.</p>

<p>The pupils of such a teacher pass on to others the game
thus imperfectly learnt, and in a short time we have a number
of corruptions creeping in, and the astonishing part of it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
insistence with which some persons will maintain that they
alone have the right idea of the rules, just because so-and-so
showed them the game, or because they and their immediate
friends have “always played it that way.”</p>

<p>This does not alter the fact that the fundamental principles
of every game are known and can be readily found if one knows
where to look for them. The author is in possession of several
hundred works in various languages&mdash;English, French, German
and Italian&mdash;on nothing but indoor games, comprising probably
everything ever printed on the subject that is worth preserving.</p>

<p>By tracing the history of a game and its development through
the various books in which it is described, the game will always
be found to belong to some distinct family, which has certain
well-defined traits which must be preserved, no matter how much
they may be altered in minor details. All games follow certain
general principles, and the surest mark of error in the local
rules of any game is inconsistency.</p>

<p>Pinochle is a striking example of this. In many places the
players will not allow the same cards to be counted twice in
the trump sequence, so as to meld 190; but they will count
them twice in four kings and queens. They insist on the rule
of at least one fresh card from the hand for each additional
meld in one case, but totally disregard it in another, as when
they meld 240 for the round trip, instead of only 220.</p>

<p>These local errors have crept into many of the Hoyles now
upon the market, the works having probably been compiled from
the individual knowledge of the author, limited by his experience
in a certain locality. Many of these works devote much
space to a certain game, which is evidently the compiler’s pet,
and which is accurately described; while other and equally important
games are full of errors and omissions, betraying a
lamentable want of care in consulting the literature of the
subject.</p>

<p>While the author of this work does not believe it possible
to compile a work that shall be universally accepted as the
authority on all games, as a dictionary would be on spelling, he
deems it at least possible to select what seems the most common
usage, or the best rule, preserving the true spirit of the game,
and to describe it accurately and bring the whole up to date.</p>

<h2>THE WHIST FAMILY.</h2>

<p>The most popular card games of the present day undoubtedly
belong to the whist family, which embraces all those played with
a full pack of fifty-two cards, ranking from the ace to the deuce,
one suit being trumps, and the score being counted by tricks and
honours, or by tricks alone.</p>

<p>The oldest and most important of the group is whist itself.
The game appears to be of English origin, its immediate parent
being “ruff and honours.” This was an old English game in
which twelve cards only were dealt to each player, the uppermost
of the remaining four being turned up for the trump suit. Whoever
held the ace of trumps could “ruff” or take in these four
cards, discarding in their place any four he chose. As the game
developed into whisk, or whist, this ruffing feature disappeared.
There was no stock, the four deuces being discarded from the
pack instead. Twelve cards were dealt to each player, and the
last was turned up for the trump.</p>

<p>About 1680 a variation of the game known as “swabbers”
came into vogue. The swabbers were the heart ace, club jack,
and the ace and deuce of trumps. The players to whom these
cards were dealt were entitled to a certain share of the stakes or
payments, independent of the play for tricks and honours. This
variety of the game did not long remain in favor, but gave way to
make room for one of the most important changes, the restoration
of the deuces to the pack, which introduced the feature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
odd trick. This took place early in the last century, and seems to
have so much improved the game that attention was soon drawn
to its possibilities for scientific treatment.</p>

<p>About this time whist was taken up by a set of gentlemen who
met at the Crown Coffee House in Bedford Row, London; chief
among whom was Sir Jacob de Bouverie, Viscount Folkestone.
After considerable experiment and practice this little whist school
laid down the principles of the game as being: “to play from the
strong suit; to study the partner’s hand; never to force partner
unnecessarily, and to attend to the score.” It is generally believed
that Edmond Hoyle was familiar with the proceedings of
this set, and on their experiences based his celebrated “Short
Treatise on the Game of Whist,” which was entered at Stationers’
Hall in London Nov. 17, 1742.</p>

<p>The only works previous to Hoyle touching upon whist were the
“Compleat Gamester” of Cotton, which first appeared in 1674, and
the “Court Gamester,” of Richard Seymour, 1719. One of Hoyle’s
great points was his calculation of the probabilities at various
stages of the rubber. This seems to have been looked upon as
most important in guiding persons in their play, for we find that
Abraham de Moivre, a famous mathematician, used to frequent
the coffee houses, and for a small fee give decisions on questions
of the odds at whist.</p>

<p>Bath seems to have been the great rallying-point for the whist-players
of the last century; but the passion for the game soon
spread all over Europe. In 1767 Benjamin Franklin went to
Paris, and it is generally believed that he introduced the American
variety of the game known as Boston, which became the rage in
Paris some time after the war of independence.</p>

<p>So popular did whist become in Italy that we find the boxes at
the opera in Florence provided with card tables in 1790. The
music of the opera was considered of value chiefly as, “increasing
the joy of good fortune, and soothing the affliction of bad.”</p>

<p>A code of laws was drawn up about 1760 by the frequenters of
White’s and Saunders’ in London. These seem to have remained
the standard until “Cælebs” published, in 1851, the code in use
at the Portland Club. In 1863 John Loraine Baldwin got
together a committee at the Arlington, now the Turf Club, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
they drew up the code which is still in use all over the world for
English whist. In the United States, laws better suited to the
American style of play were drawn up by the American Whist
League in 1891, and after several revisions were finally adopted,
in 1893, as the official code for League clubs.</p>

<p>The literature of whist saw its palmiest days at the beginning
of this century. 7,000 copies of Bob Short’s “Short Rules for
Whist” were sold in less than a year. Mathews’, or Matthews’,
“Advice to the Young Whist-Player,” went through eighteen
editions between 1804 and 1828. After these writers came
Admiral Burney, who published his “Treatise” in 1821; Major
A. [Charles Barwell Coles,] gave us his “Short Whist” in 1835.
Deschapelles published his “Traité du Whiste” in 1839, but it
gave little but discussions on the laws. “Whist, its History and
Practice” by Amateur, appeared in 1843. General de Vautré’s
“Génie du Whiste,” in 1847. “Cælebs” [Edward Augustus
Carlyon] wrote his “Laws and Practice” in 1851. Then in rapid
succession came “Cavendish” in 1863, James Clay in 1864, Pole
and “Cam” in 1865. Campbell-Walker’s “Correct Card” in
1876; Drayson’s “Art of Practical Whist,” with its new theories
of trumps; Fisher Ames, “Modern Whist,” in 1879; “Whist, or
Bumblepuppy?” by “Pembridge” [John Petch Hewby], in 1880;
G.W.P. [Pettes], in 1881; Proctor’s “How to Play Whist,” in
1885; and the “Handbook of Whist,” by “Major Tenace,” 1885.
Then began the long list of American authors (Pettes has already
been mentioned): “Foster’s Whist Manual,” by R.F. Foster, appeared
in 1890; “Practical Guide to Whist,” by Fisher Ames, in
1891; Hamilton’s “Modern Scientific Whist,” in 1894, and in the
same year, Coffin’s “Gist of Whist,” and “Foster’s Whist
Strategy.” In 1895, Milton C. Work’s “Whist of To-day,” and
“Foster’s Whist Tactics,” giving the play in the first match by
correspondence; and in 1896, Val Starnes’ “Short-suit Whist,”
and Howell’s “Whist Openings.” In 1897, Mitchell’s “Duplicate
Whist.” In 1898, Foster’s “Common Sense in Whist,” and in
1900, Fisher Ames’ “Standard Whist.” Since then whist literature
has given place to bridge.</p>

<p>In periodical literature we find whist taken up in the pages of
the “Sporting Magazine” in 1793. The London “Field” has had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
a card column since December 6, 1862. Proctor’s work first appeared
in “Knowledge.” The “Westminster Papers” devoted a
great deal of space to whist games and “jottings” every month
for eleven years, beginning in April, 1868. “Whist,” a monthly
journal devoted exclusively to the game, began publication in Milwaukee
in 1891; but gave it up when bridge supplanted whist in
popular favor.</p>

<p>Whist rapidly became a “newspaper game.” The New York
Sunday Sun devoted two columns every Sunday to the discussion
and illustration of moot points in whist tactics, and the analysis of
hands played in important matches. In a series of articles begun
February 23, 1896, this paper gave to the world the first systematic
statement of the theory and practice of the short suit game. In
1898 there were at least forty whist columns published in the United
States. Two magazines devoted to whist and bridge are now published,
one in Boston and the other in New York.</p>

<p>While the parent game has been pursuing this prosperous
course, many variations have been introduced. One of the most
radical changes in the game itself has been cutting down the
points from ten to five, which occurred about 1810. Mathews
mentions it in 1813 as having occurred since the publication of his
first edition in 1804, and Lord Peterborough, the unlucky gambler,
for whose benefit the change was introduced, died in 1814.
Another great change took place in America, where they played
for the tricks alone, the honours not being counted at all. Turning
the trump from the still pack was first tried by a Welsh baronet,
and is mentioned by Southey in his “Letters of Espriella.” This
custom was revived for a time by the Milwaukee Whist Club, and
is still sometimes seen in Europe under the name of “Prussian
Whist.”</p>

<p>Altogether we can trace nineteen games which are clearly
derived from whist. Duplicate, Drive, and Progressive whist are
simply changes in the arrangement of the players and in the
methods of scoring. Prussian whist introduces the cutting of the
trump from the still pack. Dummy and Double-dummy are simply
whist with a limited number of players, necessitating the exposure
of one or more hands upon the table. The French game of Mort
is dummy with a better system of scoring introduced. Favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
Whist simply changes the value of the tricks in scoring, according
to the trump suit. Cayenne and Bridge introduce the first changes
of importance. In Cayenne, the dealer and his partner have the
privilege of changing the trump from the suit turned up; in
Bridge they name the trump suit without any turn-up, and play
the hands as at dummy. In Boston, and Boston de Fontainebleau,
in addition to making the trump suit instead of turning it up,
further departures are introduced by naming the number of tricks
to be played for, allowing the player to take all or none without
any trump suit, and by ‘spreading’ certain hands, without allowing
the adversaries to call the exposed cards. French and
Russian Boston are simply varieties of Boston. Solo Whist is an
attempt to simplify Boston by reducing the number of proposals
and the complications of payments, and eliminating the feature of
‘spreads.’ Scotch Whist introduces a special object in addition
to winning tricks&mdash;catching the ten of trumps; that card and the
honours having particular values attached to them. This variety of
whist may be played by any number of persons from two to eight;
and its peculiarity is that when a small number play, each has
several distinct hands, which must be played in regular order, as
if held by different players. Humbug Whist is a variety of double-dummy,
in which the players may exchange their hands for those
dealt to the dummies, and the dealer may sometimes make the
trump to suit himself. German Whist is played by two persons,
and introduces the element of replenishing the hand after each
trick by drawing cards from the remainder of the pack until the
stock is exhausted. Chinese Whist is double-dummy for two,
three, or four persons, only half of each player’s cards being
exposed, the others being turned up as the exposed cards are got
rid of in the course of play.</p>

<p>All these varieties have been entirely supplanted and overshadowed
by bridge. When they play whist at all, the English
think there is nothing better than the original whist, counting
honours, and playing to the score. The Americans think Duplicate
superior to all other forms, especially when two tables are engaged,
and four players are opposed by four others for a specified
number of deals. We are inclined to agree with Clay that the
French game of Mort is “charming and highly scientific.” He
says English dummy is a “very slow game.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether it is because the game has been found ‘slow,’ or
because its more attractive forms are little known, it is certainly
true that writers on whist pay little or no attention to dummy.
The English authors mention it only in connection with laws and
decisions. No American text-book makes any allusion to the
game, and there is no reference to it in the American Whist
League’s code of laws.</p>

<p>In the first edition of this work, written in 1895, the author
ventured to prophesy that the day was not far distant when dummy
would supersede all other varieties of whist among the most expert
players; either in the form of the charming Mort or the fascinating
Bridge. Very few persons who have played either of these games
sufficiently to appreciate their beauties care to return to the platitudes
of straight whist.</p>

<p>At that time, bridge was unknown in America except to the
members of The Whist Club of New York and their friends. In
the short space of ten years it has become the card game of the
world; but in spite of its present popularity it has its defects, and
it would not be surprising to see its place usurped by another
game, not a member of the whist family, which has been steadily
gaining ground among those who have the intellectual capacity for
card games of the highest class, and that is skat.</p>

<p>The first text-book on bridge was a little leaflet printed in England
in 1886, which gave the rules for “Biritch, or Russian Whist.”
“Boax” came out with a little “Pocket Guide” in 1894, followed
by “The Laws of Bridge” in 1895. The Whist Club of N.Y.
published the American laws of bridge in 1897, and “Badsworth”
came out with the English laws in 1898. In the following year,
1899, Archibald Dunn, Jr., gave us “Bridge and How to Play It,”
and John Doe published “Bridge Conventions,” A.G. Hulme-Beaman’s
“Bridge for Beginners” appearing in the same year.
In 1900, “Foster’s Bridge Manual” appeared in America, reprinted
in England under the title of “Foster on Bridge.”</p>

<p>In the years following, text-books on bridge came from the press
by the dozen, the most notable authors being Dalton and “Hellespont”
in 1901; Elwell and Robertson in 1902; Street and Lister
in 1903. Many of the writers already mentioned published later
and more complete works, embodying the results of time and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
experience. Foster’s Self-playing Bridge Cards were brought out
in 1903. Elwell’s “Advanced Bridge” appeared in 1904 and
Foster’s “Complete Bridge” in 1905.</p>

<p>While bridge has never been such a popular “newspaper game”
as whist was in America, it has been much more so in England.
Articles on bridge, for beginners chiefly, were published in 1905
and 1906 by the San Francisco Call, Pittsburgh Post Despatch,
Cincinnati Commercial Tribune, Chicago Journal, St. Paul Despatch,
Milwaukee Journal, Baltimore American, Houston Post,
Indianapolis Star, and the N.Y. Globe. These were all edited
by R.F. Foster.</p>

<p>Bridge Tournaments, offering prizes for the best play of certain
hands were run by the N.Y. Evening Telegram, the N.Y. Globe,
the N.Y. Evening Mail, and the Chicago Journal. A number of
the weekly magazines offer similar competitions in England, but as
a rule the problems in that country are of very poor quality.</p>

<p>About 1910 it became the fashion not to play spades, it being
considered a waste of time to play a hand for such a small amount
as 2 points a trick, so the dealer was allowed to score 2 for the odd
and 4 for honours, regardless of how the cards were distributed,
the hand being abandoned. The objection to this practice was
that many hands were worth much more than 2 points, and in
some cases the spade make would have gone game at the score.
This led to the practice of playing “royal spades,” which were
played at 10 and then at 9 a trick, sometimes with a penalty of 20
if the declarer failed to make the odd.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, later in 1910, there developed a decided rebellion
against the dealer’s monopoly of the make, and in order
to allow any player at the table who held good cards to get the
benefit of them, whether he was the dealer or not, bidding for the
privilege of making the trump came into vogue. This was the
starting point of auction, its chief difference from the older
game being that only the side that made the highest bid for the
declaration could score toward game. The full number of tricks
bid had to be made, and if they were not made, the adversaries
scored in the honour column for penalties, the penalty being always
the same, regardless of the trump suit.</p>

<p>The great disparity in the values of the suits as then played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
practically confined the bidding to the hearts and royal spades.
This soon brought about another change, which was to
raise the values of all the suits except spades and to cut down
the no-trumper. This was done in 1912, and made it possible
for any suit to go game on the hand. All the well known writers
on whist and bridge came out with text-books on auction, and
the newspapers took up the subject in weekly articles.</p>

<p>Although to many the game now seemed perfect, there were
those that felt the helplessness of weak hands to offer any
defence in the bidding against a run of no-trumpers or hearts
and royals. To remedy this, F.C. Thwaites of the Milwaukee
Whist Club suggested the introduction of the nullo. This was
a bid to lose tricks, at no trump only, and its value was to be
minus 10, that is, it was to be outranked only by a no-trumper
to win. At first, this bid was largely used simply as an additional
game-going declaration, and was strongly objected to by
many leading players. But as its true place as a defensive bid
became better understood it soon came into favour. In the nullo
there are no honours, and the declarer scores the tricks over the
book made by his opponents, which he forces them to take.
Many interesting card problems have been built upon the nullo.</p>

<p>Toward the end of 1913 still another change seems to have
suggested itself to some of the English players who were familiar
with the Russian game of vint, and that is to play auction just
as it is played up to the point of the lead to the first trick, but
that no dummy is exposed, the four players holding up their
cards and following suit just as they would at whist. Whether
or not this game will ever become as popular as the combination
of dealer and dummy, it is difficult to say, but appearances are
against it.</p>

<p>There seems to be a growing tendency in America to adopt
the English rule of cutting out the spade suit at 2 a trick, and
making it always a royal spade, worth 9. The dealer is allowed
to pass without making a bid, the lowest call being one club.
If all pass, the deal goes to the left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span></p>

<h3>BRIDGE.</h3>

<p>There are two principal varieties of this game; straight bridge,
in which the dealer or his partner must make the trump, their
opponents having nothing to say about it except to double the
value of the tricks. The dealer’s partner is always the dummy,
and either side may score toward game by making the odd trick
or more. Auction bridge, in which the privilege of making the
trump is bid for, the highest bidder playing the hand with his
partner as dummy, regardless of the position of the deal, and
his side being the only one that can score toward game, the
adversaries scoring nothing but penalties in the honour column
if they defeat the contract.</p>

<p>As this is the more popular form of bridge at the present
time, it will be given first. Since the adoption of the higher
value for the spade suit under the name of royal spades, and
the change in the value of the suits, the game gradually came to
be known as royal auction, but as that change is now universal,
the name has slipped back to its original title.</p>

<h4>AUCTION BRIDGE, OR AUCTION.</h4>

<p><b><i>CARDS.</i></b> Auction is played with a full pack of fifty-two
cards, ranking A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2, the Ace being the
highest in play, but ranking below the deuce in cutting. Two
packs should be used, the one being shuffled while the other is
dealt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span></p>

<p><b><i>MARKERS</i></b> suitable for scoring the various points made at
Bridge have not yet been invented. Some persons use the bézique
marker; but it is not a success. The score is usually kept on a
sheet of paper, and it should be put down by each side, for purposes
of verification.</p>

<p><b><i>PLAYERS.</i></b> Auction is played by four persons, and the table
is complete with that number. When there are more than four
candidates for play, the selection of the four is made by cutting.
These cut again for partners, and the choice of seats and cards.</p>

<p><b><i>CUTTING.</i></b> The usual method of cutting for partners, etc.,
at auction, is to shuffle the cards thoroughly, and “spread” them
face downwards on the table; each candidate drawing a card, and
turning it face upwards in front of him. The four cutting the
lowest cards playing the first game, or rubber.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/pxxvia.jpg" width="250" height="75" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SPREADING THE PACK.</p>
</div>

<p>The four having been selected, the cards are again shuffled and
spread, and partners are cut for; the two lowest pairing against
the two highest; the lowest of the four is the dealer, and has the
choice of cards and seats.</p>

<p><b><i>TIES.</i></b> As between cards of equal value in cutting, the heart
is the lowest, diamonds next, then clubs and then spades.</p>

<p><b><i>POSITION OF THE PLAYERS.</i></b> The four players at
the bridge table are indicated by letters; A and B are partners
against Y and Z; Z always represents the dealer, who always
makes the first bid, A being the second bidder, Y the third and B
the fourth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/pxxvib.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Diagram of the position of the players at the table" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span></p>

<p><b><i>DEALING.</i></b> The cards having been properly shuffled the
dealer, Z, presents them to the pone, B, to be cut. At least four
cards must be left in each packet. Beginning at his left, the dealer
distributes the cards one at a time in rotation until the pack is
exhausted. When two packs are used, the dealer’s partner shuffles
one while the other is dealt, and the deal passes in regular
rotation to the left until the rubber is finished.</p>

<p><b><i>IRREGULARITIES IN THE DEAL.</i></b> If any card is
found faced in the pack, or if the pack is incorrect or imperfect,
the dealer must deal again. If any card is found faced in the
pack, or is exposed in any manner; or if more than thirteen cards
are dealt to any player, or if the last card does not come in its
regular order to the dealer, or if the pack has not been cut, there
must be a new deal. Attention must be called to a deal out of
turn, or with the wrong cards, before the last card is dealt, or
the deal stands.</p>

<p>There are no misdeals in auction. That is to say, whatever
happens the same dealer deals again. Minor irregularities will be
found provided for in the laws.</p>

<p>The cards being dealt, each player sorts his hand to see that he
has the correct number, thirteen; and the player or players keeping
the score should announce it at the beginning of each hand.</p>

<p><b><i>STAKES.</i></b> In auction, the stake is a unit, so much a point.
The number of points won or lost on the rubber may be only two
or three, or they may run into the hundreds. The average value
of a rubber at auction is about 400 points. Any much larger
figure shows bad bidding. In straight bridge the average is
about 180. In settling at the end of the rubber, it is usual for
each losing player to pay his right-hand adversary.</p>

<p><b><i>MAKING THE TRUMP.</i></b> In auction, the dealer begins
by naming any one of the four suits, or no trumps, for any number
of tricks he pleases. Each player in turn to the left then has
the privilege of passing, bidding higher, or doubling. When three
players pass a bid, it is the highest made and is known as the
<i><b>Winning Declaration</b></i> or <i><b>Contract</b></i>.</p>

<p>In order to understand the principles that govern the players
in their declarations, one should be thoroughly familiar with the
values attached to the tricks when certain suits are trumps. The
first six tricks taken by the side that has made the winning
declaration do not count. This is the “book,” but all over the
book count toward making good on the contract, according to
the following table:</p>

<p>The game is 30 points, which must be made by tricks alone, so
that three over the book, called three “by cards,” will go game
from love at no trump, or four by cards at hearts or royals.
These are called the <i><b>Major</b></i> or <i><b>Winning Suits</b></i>. As it takes
five by cards to go game in clubs or diamonds, and on account
of the difficulty of such an undertaking, these are called the
<i><b>Minor</b></i> or <i><b>Losing Suits</b></i>. An original bid of one spade can
be made only by the dealer, and it simply means, “I pass.” That
is, the dealer has nothing to declare on the first round of the bidding.
[See note at foot of <a href="#Page_58">page 58</a>.]</p>

<p><b><i>RANK OF THE BIDS.</i></b> In order to over-call a previous
bid, whether of the partner or the opponent, the bidder must
undertake to win the same number of tricks in a suit of higher
value, or a greater number of tricks having the same aggregate
value as the preceding bid. Players should restrict themselves to
the same form of expression throughout, and all bids, even passing,
must be made orally and not by gesture.</p>

<p>Let us suppose this to be the bidding: The dealer, Z,
begins with “One spade,” second player, A, says, “I pass,” or
simply, “No.” Third bidder, Y, says, “One club,” fourth player,
B, “No trump.” The dealer, starting on the second round,
says, “Two clubs,” supporting his partner’s declaration. Next
player, A, who passed the first time, says, “Two royals.” Both
Y and B pass, but the dealer, Z, says, “Three clubs.” Observe that
while three clubs is worth no more than two royals, 18, the club
bid offers to win more tricks than the royals and therefore ranks
as a higher bid. A doubles three clubs. Y passes and B says,
“Two no trumps.” As will be explained presently, doubling does
not affect the value of the declaration in bidding, so two no
trumps, worth 20, over-calls three clubs. Z, A and Y all pass, so
two no trumps becomes the winning declaration and B is the
declarer, A being the dummy, with Z to lead for the first trick.</p>

<p>In this example, had the bid been left at three clubs, doubled
or not, that would have been the winning declaration, and the
partner who first named that suit, Y, would be the declarer, Z
being the dummy, although Z actually made the highest bid. It
is only when the two players that have both named the winning
suit are not partners that the higher bidder becomes the declarer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span></p>

<p><b><i>DOUBLING.</i></b> No player may double his partner, but he
may redouble an opponent who has doubled. All doubling must
be strictly in turn, like any other bid. Doubling does not affect
the value of the bids, but simply doubles the value of the tricks
or penalties when they are scored at the end of the hand. Suppose
A bids two royals and Y doubles. B can take A out with
three clubs, because, so far as the bidding goes, two royals are
still worth only 18.</p>

<p>Any over-call annuls the double, or redouble. Suppose A says
two hearts, Y doubles, B redoubles, and Z says two royals. The
doubling is all knocked out, and if A were to go three hearts
and get the contract, hearts would be worth only 8 a trick in the
scoring unless Y doubled all over again. A double reopens the
bidding, just the same as any other declaration, allowing the
player’s partner, or the player himself in his turn, to take himself
out of the double by bidding something else.</p>

<p><b><i>IRREGULARITIES IN DECLARING.</i></b> If any
player declares out of turn, either in bidding a suit or in doubling,
either opponent may demand a new deal, or may allow the declaration
so made to stand, in which case the next player to the
left must bid, just as if the declaration had been in turn. If a
player pass out of turn there is no penalty, and the player
whose turn it was must declare himself. The player who
has passed out of his proper turn may re-enter the bidding if the
declaration he passed has been over-called or doubled.</p>

<p>If a player makes an insufficient or impossible declaration,
either adversary may call attention to it. Suppose the last bid
is three royals, and the next player says four clubs. This is not
enough, as three royals is worth 27 and four clubs only 24. Unless
the player in error correct himself at once, and make it five
clubs, either adversary may demand that it be five clubs, and
the partner of the corrected player cannot bid unless this five-club
bid is over-called or doubled. A player correcting himself must
stick to the suit named, not being allowed to say four diamonds
when he sees that four clubs is not enough.</p>

<p>If an insufficient declaration is passed or over-called by the
player on the left, it is too late to demand any penalty, and the
insufficient bid stands as regular. Suppose A bids three royals
and Y says four clubs, B and Z passing. A can repeat his bid
of three royals if he likes, as that is enough to over-call four
clubs.</p>

<p>If a player makes an impossible declaration, such as calling six
diamonds over five no trumps, when it is clearly impossible to
make any diamond declaration worth 50, either adversary may
demand a new deal, or may insist that the last bid made by his
own side, five no trumps, shall be the winning declaration, or he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
may force the player in error to declare a grand slam in diamonds
and play it, his partner being forbidden to take him out.</p>

<p><b><i>METHOD OF PLAYING.</i></b> The winning declaration
settled, whether doubled or not, the player on the left of the declarer
leads for the first trick, and dummy’s cards go down, the
declarer playing the combined hands. The declarer gathers the
tricks for his side, but either adversary may gather for the other.
The first six tricks taken by the declarer make a book, and all over
the book count toward his contract. The adversaries have a
book as soon as they reach the limit of the tricks they may
win without “setting” the contract. If the contract is four hearts,
the declarer must win ten tricks, so that his opponents have a
book when they get home three tricks. All tricks should be laid
so that they may be readily counted by any player at the table.</p>

<p><b><i>DUMMY.</i></b> Until a card is led by the proper player, the declarer’s
partner has all the rights of any other player, but as soon
as the player to the left of the declarer leads and dummy’s cards
are laid on the table, dummy’s duties and rights are restricted to
the following:</p>

<p>He may call attention to few cards played to a trick; correct
an improper claim of either adversary; call attention to a trick
taken by the wrong side; ask his partner if he have none of a
suit to which he renounces; correct an erroneous score; consult
with the declarer as to which penalty to exact for a revoke;
and, if he has not intentionally overlooked the hand of another
player, he may call his partner’s attention to an established
revoke made by the adversaries, or to a card exposed by them
or a lead out of turn made by them.</p>

<p><b><i>The Revoke.</i></b> Should a player fail to follow suit when able
to do so, it is a revoke, and the revoke is established when the
trick in which it occurs is turned down and quitted by the side
that won it, or when the revoking player, or his partner, in his
right turn or otherwise, has led or played to the following
trick. If a player ask his partner if he has none of the suit led,
before the trick is turned down, the revoke may be corrected,
unless the player in error replies in the negative, or has led or
played to the next trick.</p>

<p>Dummy cannot revoke under any circumstances.</p>

<p>The penalty for the revoke depends on the side in error.
If the declarer revokes he cannot score anything but honours as
actually held, while the adversaries take 100 points penalty in the
honour column, in addition to any they may be entitled to for defeating
the declaration. If an adversary revokes, they score
honours only, and the declarer may either take the 100 points, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
he may take three actual tricks and add them to his own. If
he takes the tricks, they may aid him in fulfilling his contract, as
the score is then made up as the tricks lie, but the declarer will
not be entitled to any bonus in case he was doubled.</p>

<p>Suppose Z is the declarer, and is playing three hearts doubled.
He wins the odd trick only, but detects a revoke, for which he
takes three tricks. This gives him four by cards, doubled, worth
64 points toward game, but he does not get any bonus for making
his contract after being doubled, or for the extra tricks, because
they were taken in penalty and not in play.</p>

<p><b><i>Exposed Cards.</i></b> After the deal but before the winning
declaration is settled, if any player exposes a card his partner
is barred from bidding or doubling, and the card is subject to
call. Should the partner of the offending player prove to be the
leader to the first trick, the declarer may prohibit the initial lead
of the exposed suit.</p>

<p>All cards exposed by the declarer’s adversaries after the original
lead are liable to be called and must be left on the table,
face upward. Exposed cards are those played two at a time,
dropped on the table face up, or so held that the partner might
see them, or cards mentioned as being in the hand of the player
or his partner. The declarer is not liable to any penalty for
exposed cards.</p>

<p><b><i>Leading Out of Turn.</i></b> If either adversary leads out of
turn, the declarer may call the card exposed, or call a suit when
it is the turn of either adversary to lead. If the declarer leads out
of turn, from his own hand or dummy’s, there is no penalty, but
he may not correct the error unless directed to do so by an adversary.
If the second hand plays to the false lead, it must stand.
If the declarer plays from his own hand or from dummy to a
false lead, the trick stands. In case the dealer calls a suit and
the player has none, the penalty is paid.</p>

<p><b><i>Cards Played in Error.</i></b> If any player but dummy
omits to play to a trick, and does not correct the error until he
has played to the next trick, the other side may claim a new deal.
If the deal stands, the surplus card at the end is supposed to
belong to the short trick, but is not a revoke.</p>

<p><b><i>OBJECT OF THE GAME.</i></b> The object in auction is
for the declarer to fulfil his contract, and for the adversaries to
defeat it. The highest card played to the trick, if of the suit led,
wins the trick, and trumps win all other suits. At the end of the
hand the declarer counts up the tricks he has won over the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
and if he has made good on his contract he scores the value of
those tricks toward game. As soon as either side reaches 30, it is
a game, but the hands are played out, and all the tricks counted.</p>

<p><b><i>RUBBERS.</i></b> Three games, 30 points or more each, make
a rubber, but if the first two are won by the same partners the
third game is not played. The side that first wins two games adds
250 rubber points to its score.</p>

<p><b><i>SCORING.</i></b> Apart from the game score, which is made
entirely by tricks won on successful declarations, there are
several additional scores that have no influence in winning or
losing the game, although they may materially affect the ultimate
value of the rubber. These are all entered under the head of
“honour scores,” or “above the line.”</p>

<p><b><i>Honours</i></b> are the five highest cards in the trump suit, A K Q J
10; when there is no trump, they are the four Aces. The partners
holding three, four or five honours between them, or four honours
in one hand, or four in one hand and the fifth in the partner’s,
or all five in one hand, are entitled to claim and score them,
according to the following table. It will be seen that their value
varies according to the trump suit; and it must be remembered
that this value cannot be increased by doubling.</p>

</table>

<p class="center smaller">Rubber 250, Grand Slam 40, Little Slam 20.</p>

<p>When one side has nothing but the odd honour, three out of the
five, it is called <i><b>simple honours</b></i>. The value of simple honours
is always the same as two tricks.</p>

<p><b><i>Slams.</i></b> Little Slam is made by taking twelve of the thirteen
tricks; it counts 20 points. Grand Slam is made by taking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span>
thirteen tricks, and it counts 40. Either score must be exclusive
of revoke penalties.</p>

<p><b><i>PENALTIES.</i></b> If the declarer succeeds in making his contract,
he scores below the line for tricks and above the line for
honours according to the table of values already given, and he
scores for as many tricks as he wins, regardless of the smaller
number he may have bid.</p>

<p>But if the declarer fails to make good on his contract he
scores nothing but honours as actually held, while his adversaries
score 50 points penalty in the honour column for every trick by
which the declaration falls short, no matter what the declaration
was, but they never score anything toward game, no matter
how many tricks they win, because they are not the declarers.
They may, however, score slams.</p>

<p>If we suppose the winning declaration to be three hearts, and
the declarer makes the odd trick only, holding simple honours, he
scores 16 above the line, while the other side scores 100 points
above the line for defeating the contract by two tricks, worth
50 each.</p>

<p>If the dealer is left in with one spade, he cannot lose more
than 100 points, even if he is doubled, provided neither he nor
his partner redouble. If the adversaries set the contract for one
trick, the declarer loses 50 only, and even if he is set for six
tricks, he can lose only the 100.</p>

<p>If any other declaration is doubled and fails, the adversaries
score 100 points, instead of 50, for every trick by which they
defeat the contract. If it is redoubled, they score 200. But if
the declarer succeeds after being doubled, he not only scores
double value for the tricks toward game, but he gets 50 points
for fulfilling a doubled contract and 50 more for any tricks
over his contract if he makes them. These figures are 100 in
each case if he redoubles.</p>

<p>Suppose the declaration is three no trumps, doubled, and the
declarer makes five by cards. He scores 5 times 20 toward game,
aces as held, and then 150 in penalties, 50 of which is for
fulfilling his contract and twice 50 for the two tricks over his
contract.</p>

<p><b><i>KEEPING SCORE.</i></b> Two styles of score-pad are now in
general use. In one the tricks and honours are entered in the
same vertical column, one above the other, and are all added in
one sum at the end. In the other style of pad the tricks are in
one column and the honours and penalties in another, so that four
additions are required to find the value of the rubber, which is
always the difference between the total scores after giving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
winners of two games 250 points. The following illustration

<p class="clearboth">The scoring on which this rubber is won and lost was as
follows: WE started with a contract to win one heart and made
it, with simple honours, scoring 8 toward game and 16 above
for honours. Then THEY set a contract for two tricks, getting
100 in penalties, against simple honours in royals, scored as 18
above for WE and 100 for THEY. Then THEY made four
odd at no trump and 30 aces, winning the first game, under which
a line is drawn.</p>

<p>On the next deal THEY made four odd in royals, with four
honours, 36 each way, winning the second game and also the
rubber, for which they add 250 points. Both scores are now added
up and the lower deducted from the higher, showing that THEY
win 450 points on the balance.</p>

<p><b><i>CUTTING OUT.</i></b> At the conclusion of the rubber, if
there are more than four candidates for play, the selection of
the new table is made by cutting; those who have just played
having an equal chance with the newcomers. The reason for
this is that a Bridge table is complete with four, and that a rubber
is usually too long, with its preliminaries of making the trump,
and its finalities of settling the score, for players to wait their
turn. A rubber at Short Whist is often over in two hands; but a
carefully played rubber at Bridge sometimes occupies an hour.</p>

<p><b><i>CHEATING.</i></b> Most of the cheating done at the bridge
table is of such a character that it cannot be challenged without
difficulty, although there is enough of it to be most annoying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Some players will place an ace about four cards from the top
when they shuffle the cards, so that when the pack is spread for
the cut they can draw it and get the first deal. Second dealing is
a common trick, especially on ocean steamers, marking the aces
and slipping them back if they would fall to an adversary dealing
them to the partner instead, who can go no trumps and score a
hundred aces several times in an evening. Women are great
offenders in trifling matters, such as asking the dealer if she
passed it, when nothing has been said; looking over the adversaries’
hands as dummy, and then pushing dummy’s cards forward,
as if arranging them, but in reality indicating which one to
play. A great deal of petty cheating is done in putting down the
score, and also in balancing it by cancellation. In large charity
games, some women are so eager to win a prize that they will
stoop to all manner of private signals, and some go so far as to
make up a table and agree to double everything, so that some one
of the four shall have a big score. Another common trick in so-called
social games is to have a stool pigeon to overlook the hand
of another and signal it up to the confederate who is playing.</p>

<p>There may be some remedy for this sort of thing, but so far
no one seems to have found it; or at least they lack the courage
to put it in practice and expose the offenders.</p>

<p><b><i>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</i></b> The great
secret of success in auction lies in sound bidding, so that no bid
shall have a double meaning and the partner may be able to rely
absolutely on the information which the bid should convey. The
complications of the situation are so numerous, owing to the variations
introduced by each succeeding bid as the players over-call
one another, that it would be impossible to cover them in a work
of this kind, and the student would do well to consult some such
work as “Whitehead’s Conventions,” which covers every situation
that could possibly arise in the bidding.</p>

<p>A few general hints may be of assistance in showing the
principles that govern the more common situations.</p>

<p><b><i>The Dealer’s Bids</i></b> may be divided into four parts; a
spade, a losing suit, a winning suit, and no trumps. The one-spade
bid simply means, “I pass,” but it does not signify that
he will not be willing to bid on the second round. It has nothing
whatever to do with the spade suit.</p>

<p>The dealer should never call any suit on the first round of
bids unless he has two sure tricks in it. If it is a losing suit,
he may have just those two tricks and nothing else, and the
shorter the suit the better, but the tricks must be A K, or K Q J,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
or A Q J. If it is a winning suit he must have at least five cards
of it and a trick or two in some other suit to back it up.</p>

<p>If the dealer bids two spades, he shows two sure tricks in a
short spade suit and a sure trick outside. If he bids three spades
he shows five or more spades and strength enough outside for
royals, but denies two sure tricks in the spade suit itself. The
dealer should bid no trumps when he has not length enough to
bid hearts or royals, but has a hand as good as three aces, well
protected in three suits.</p>

<p><b><i>The Second Hand</i></b> should declare just as if he were the
dealer when the dealer starts with one spade. He may even go
no trump on a lighter hand. When the dealer bids a suit,
second hand should over-call only when he can make his contract
or wishes to indicate a lead in case third hand should go to
no trumps. Second hand should never take the dealer out of a
losing suit with a winning suit unless he has seven tricks in his
own hand. If the dealer bids no trump, second hand should pass,
unless he is prepared to over-call any further bid for three tricks.</p>

<p><b><i>Third Hand</i></b> is not obliged to take the dealer out of a
spade, and should not do so unless he is a trick or two stronger
than he would have to be to declare as dealer. But the dealer
must never be left in with a two or three spade bid. If third
hand cannot do any better, he should declare a royal. When
the dealer bids no trump, third hand should take him out with any
weak five card suit and nothing else, simply to warn him that
there are no winning cards in the hand. Always take him out
with five cards in a winning suit, no matter how strong the
rest of the hand.</p>

<p>Take the dealer out of one suit with another suit only to deny
his suit. Take him out of a winning suit with no trump, only to
deny his suit and show strength in each of the three other suits.
If the dealer bids no trump and second hand calls a suit, double
if you can stop the suit twice, otherwise show any good suit of
your own, but do not go two no-trumps unless you can do it all
yourself. Leave that to your partner. Do not assist your partner’s
suit bids with less than three tricks if second hand over-calls.</p>

<p><b><i>Fourth Hand</i></b> bids on the bidding much more than on
his cards. He should never take the dealer out of a spade that
both second and third hand have passed unless he can go game.
If the dealer bids a losing suit, second and third hands passing,
leave him in unless you can go game and are not afraid of a shift.
If the dealer bids a winning suit, second and third hands passing,
make any sound declaration. If the dealer starts with no trumps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
show any suit that might save the game if led at once by your
partner.</p>

<p><b><i>Subsequent Bids.</i></b> Any suit bid on the second round but not on
the first, shows length without the tops. When a winning suit is
taken out by the partner, a losing suit bid on the second round
shows tops in it. Any suit rebid on the second round, without
waiting for the partner’s assistance, shows six or seven sure
tricks in hand.</p>

<p>Never bid a hand twice, unless its strength is greater than
indicated by the first bid. Having bid a club on ace king alone,
that is the end of it. If you have an outside ace, which the club
bid did not show, you can assist your partner once on that
trick, but no more. Having assisted your partner’s suit bid with
three tricks, do not bid again unless you have a fourth trick
in hand, but if he rebids his suit without waiting for you, you may
assist on one trick, especially a high honour in trumps.</p>

<p>Do not double unless you have a certainty and are not afraid
of a shift. Do not give up a fair chance for going game yourself
just to double an adversary, unless you are sure of 200 in
penalties at least, and do not give up the rubber game for less
than 300. Always remember that a double may enable an adversary
to go game, and will often show the declarer which hand
to finesse against.</p>

<p><b><i>Free Doubles</i></b> are opportunities to double when the declarer
will go game anyhow if he makes his contract, but they should
never be made if there is any chance that he may shift.</p>

<p><b><i>Free Bids</i></b> are anything better than a spade by the dealer,
or anything that over-calls a previous bid, because no one is
forced to bid on the first round. A <i><b>Shout</b></i> is a bid that is a
trick more than necessary to over-call the previous bid. It shows a
solid suit, or five or six sure tricks in hand. In a losing suit it is
a loud call for the partner to go no trumps if he can. A free bid
in a losing suit shows the high cards; in a winning suit it shows
the tricks in hand.</p>

<p><b><i>A Forced Bid</i></b> is one that is necessary to over-call, such as
two diamonds over a heart. This does not mean that the
caller would have bid two diamonds originally. A player who
must indicate a lead against a no-trumper makes a forced bid.</p>

<p><b><i>The Original Lead.</i></b> The first card must be played before
dummy’s hand is exposed.</p>

<p><b><i>OPENING LEADS.</i></b> The position which we have first
to consider is that of the eldest hand, usually designated by the
letter “A,” who sits on the declarer’s left.</p>

<p><b><i>Selecting the Suit to Lead.</i></b> If your partner has declared
a suit, lead the best card you hold of it, regardless of
number, unless you have an ace-king suit of your own, in which
case lead the king first and have a look at dummy. If partner has
not declared anything, lead your own suit. With high cards not
in sequence, such as ace-queen, king-jack, or even queen-ten, in
every suit but trumps, lead the trump.</p>

<p>There is a great difference between playing against a trump
declaration and against no-trumpers; because in the first case the
leader is opposed to unusual trump strength and his object must
be to make what he can of his winning cards, before the declarer
gets into the lead and discards his weak suits, so as to be ready
to trump them. But in the second case, there being no trumps,
the leader’s object should be to get a suit established against the
dealer, if he can, and the longer the suit is, the better. The
dealer’s strength in a no-trumper is usually scattered, and he may
often be found with a weak or missing suit, which is generally
the suit in which the eldest hand or his partner is long.</p>

<p>We shall first consider the leads against trump declarations,
because they are more common and are also the more useful. If
a player makes a trump-hand lead against a no-trump declaration,
he will not do nearly so much harm as if he make a no-trump-hand
lead against a trump declaration. For that reason, if a
player cannot master both systems of leading, it is better for him
to learn the leads against trumps than those against no-trumps.</p>

<p><b><i>Rules for Leading High Cards.</i></b> With such a suit as
A K Q 2, no one need be told not to begin with the deuce.
Whenever a player holds two or more of the best cards of a
suit he should play one of them. If he holds both second and
third best, playing one of them will force the best out of his
way, leaving him with the commanding card.</p>

<p>The cards which are recognised by bridge players as high, are
the A K Q J 10, and if we separate the various combinations
from which a player should lead each of them, a study of the
groups so formed will greatly facilitate our recollection of them.</p>

<p>In the first group are those containing two or more of the
best cards. In this and all following notation, the exact size of
any card below a Ten is immaterial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p007a.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="🂡 🂮 🂭 🂫 | 🂱 🂾 🂻 🂷 | 🃁 🃎 🃍 🃆 | 🃑 🃞 🃔 🃓" />
</div>

<p>So far as trick-taking is concerned, it is of no importance which
of the winning cards is first led; but good players lead the <i><b>King</b></i>
from all these combinations in order that the partner may be informed,
by its winning, that the leader holds the Ace also.</p>

<p>In the second group are those containing both the second and
third best, but not the best.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p007b.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="🂮 🂭 🂫 🂪 | 🂾 🂽 🂺 🂸 | 🃎 🃍 🃋 🃄 | 🃞 🃝 🃗 🃖" />
</div>

<p>The <i><b>King</b></i> is the proper lead from these combinations. If it
wins, the partner should have the Ace; if it loses, partner should
know the leader holds at least the Queen.</p>

<p>Both these groups, which contain all the King leads, may be
easily remembered by observing that the King is always led if
accompanied by the Ace or Queen, or both. Beginners should
follow this rule for leading the King, regardless of the number of
small cards in the suit.</p>

<p>There is only one combination from which the <i><b>Queen</b></i> is led,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/p007c.jpg" width="280" height="75" alt="🃝 🃛 🃗 🃖" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">when it is accompanied by the Jack, and there is no higher card of
the suit in the hand. Whether the ten follows the Jack or not, does
not matter. With any two high cards in sequence, the lead is a
high card when playing against a declared trump.</p>

<p>The <i><b>Jack</b></i> is never led except as a supporting card. It is always
the top of the suit, and the suit is usually short. The object of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
making such an opening is to avoid leading suits headed by two
honours which are not in sequence. These are good Jack leads:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">
<img src="images/p008a.jpg" width="410" height="75" alt="🂻 🂺 🂹 🂴 | 🂫 🂧" />
</div>

<p>The <i><b>Ten</b></i> is led from one combination only:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/p008b.jpg" width="260" height="75" alt="🃎 🃋 🃊 🃆" />
</div>

<p>The <i><b>Ace</b></i> should not be led if it can be avoided; but it is better
to lead it from suits of more than four cards, so as to make it at
once. If the Ace is accompanied by the King, the King is the card
to lead, not the Ace. If the Ace is accompanied by other honours,
such as the Queen or Jack, it is better to avoid opening the suit,
unless you have five or more cards of it. But if you do lead a suit
headed by the Ace, <i><b>without the King</b></i>, be sure that you lead the
Ace, when playing against a trump declaration, or you may never
make it.</p>

<p>All such combinations as the following should be avoided, if possible,
as more can be made out of them by letting them alone:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">
<img src="images/p008c.jpg" width="475" height="300" alt="🃑 🃝 🃚 🃔 | 🃞 🃛 🃘 🃔 | 🂱 🂻 🂺 🂴 | 🂽 🂻 🂶 🂴 | 🂮 🂨 🂧 🂤 | 🂫 🂪 🂩 🂤 | 🃍 🃆 🃅 🃄 | 🃊 🃉 🃈 🃄" />
</div>

<p>But with three honours, A Q J, the Ace should be led.</p>

<p><b><i>Rules for Leading Short Suits.</i></b> It will sometimes happen
that the only four-card suit in the leader’s hand will be trumps or a
suit headed by honours not in sequence, which it is not desirable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
lead. In such cases, if there is no high-card combination in any of
the short suits, it is usual to lead the highest card, unless it is an
Ace or King. Many good players will not lead the Queen from a
three-card suit, unless it is accompanied by the Jack. All such
leads are called <i><b>forced</b></i>, and are intended to assist the partner, by
playing cards which may strengthen him, although of no use to the
leader. The best card should be led from any such combinations
as the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 415px;">
<img src="images/p009a.jpg" width="415" height="225" alt="🃝 🃛 🃖 | 🃊 🃉 🃄 | 🃋 🃊 🃅 | 🃙 🃘 🃔 | 🂫 🂥 🂣 | 🂷 🂶 🂴" />
</div>

<p><b><i>Small-card Leads.</i></b> If the suit selected for the lead does
not contain any combination of high cards from which it would be
right to lead a high card, good players make it a rule to begin with
the fourth-best, counting from the top of the suit. This is called
the “card of uniformity,” because it indicates to the partner that
there are remaining in the leader’s hand exactly three cards higher
than the one led.</p>

<p>Should the player be forced to lead any of the undesirable combinations
shown on the last page, he would begin with the Ace if he
held it; otherwise he would lead the fourth-best. In each of the
hands shown this would be the four, and this card would be led,
even if there were five or six cards in the suit. From this hand,
for instance, the five is the proper lead:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">
<img src="images/p009b.jpg" width="410" height="75" alt="🃎 🃈 🃆 🃅 🃄 🃃 🃂" />
</div>

<p><b><i>Rules for Leading Second Round.</i></b> If the leader wins the
first trick, having the best of the suit in his hand, he should follow
with the winning card; but if he has several cards which are equally
winning cards, he should lead the lowest of them. This is an indication
to the partner that the card led is as good as the best;
therefore the leader must hold the intermediate cards. When a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
King wins, your partner knows you have the Ace, if he does not
hold it. Then tell him what he does not know, that you have the
Queen also.</p>

<p>Suppose you have led the King from these combinations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p010a.jpg" width="500" height="75" alt="🂱 🂾 🂽 🂻 | 🂡 🂮 🂭 🂢" />
</div>

<p>Your partner knows you have the Ace, because your King wins.
From the first, go on with the Jack, which is just as good as the
Ace, but tells your partner you have not only the Ace but the
Queen, still in your hand. From the second, go on with the Queen,
the card your partner does not know, which tells him you still have
the Ace, <i><b>but not the Jack</b></i>. If you have not the Queen, you will
have to go on with the Ace, and your leading the Ace <i><b>will deny
the Queen</b></i>.</p>

<p>If you have not the best, lead one of the second and third-best,
if you hold both:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p010b.jpg" width="500" height="75" alt="🃞 🃝 🃛 🃚 | 🂾 🂽 🂻 🂲" />
</div>

<p>From the first of these, having led the King, if it wins, go on with
the ten, whether you have any smaller cards or not. From the
second, if the King wins, go on with the Jack, which denies the ten,
but tells your partner you still have the Queen. No mistake is
more common among beginners than leading a low card on the
second round, on the assumption that the partner must have the
Ace. If you have led from King and Queen only, you must go on
with the fourth-best; because you have not both the second and
third-best. This fourth-best is the card that was the fourth-best
originally. Having led the King from this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/p010c.jpg" width="340" height="75" alt="🃎 🃍 🃈 🃆 🃅 🃃" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">the card to follow the King is the six, if the King wins the first trick.</p>

<p><b><i>The Fourth-best.</i></b> From any combination of cards, if you
have not the best, or both the second and third-best, in your
hand for the second round, lead your original fourth-best. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
all the following, the proper lead on the second round would be the
fourth-best, in each case the four of the suit:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/p011.jpg" width="520" height="225" alt="🂡 🂭 🂧 🂤 🂢 | 🂾 🂽 🂸 🂴 | 🃁 🃋 🃉 🃄 🃃 | 🂮 🂭 🂧 🂤 | 🃑 🃙 🃘 🃔 🃓 | 🃎 🃋 🃊 🃄" />
</div>

<p><b><i>Leading Trumps.</i></b> A trump lead is sometimes adopted
when all the plain suits are bad ones to lead away from, such
as A Q, or A J, or K J in each and no length. If a player holds
high cards which are not in sequence, such as the major tenace,
ace and queen, it is very probable that the declarer holds the king.
By refusing to lead such suits, and waiting for them to come
up to the tenace, the declarer’s high card may be caught and
a valuable trick saved. When a good player opens his hand with
a trump, right up to the declaration, his partner should lead his
best supporting cards boldly up to dummy’s weak suits.</p>

<p><b><i>The Pone’s Leads.</i></b> When the pone gets into the lead, if
he does not return his partner’s suit, he should open his own
suits according to the rules already given for all the high-card combinations.
If he has no high-card combination, it is usually better
for him to lead some card that will beat Dummy than to lead his
fourth-best. Suppose he wishes to lead a diamond, in which he
holds Q 10 8 4 3; Dummy having the 9 and 6 only. It is better
to lead the ten of diamonds than the fourth-best, because if the
declarer does not follow with an honour, your partner will not have
to sacrifice an honour to keep Dummy from winning the trick with
the 9.</p>

<p>After the opening lead, when Dummy’s cards are exposed, the
knowledge of his cards may change the aspect of the game greatly;
but the proper cards to lead to and through Dummy will be better
understood in connection with the play against no-trumpers.</p>

<p><b><i>No-trump Leads.</i></b> The chief difference in the leads against
no-trumpers is, that there is no hurry to make your aces and
kings, the chief thing being to make some of the smaller cards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
good for tricks. When you are long in a suit, if you lead out the
winning cards first, your partner may have none to lead you later
on, and if you cannot make every trick in the suit before you lose
the lead, you may never make anything but your one or two high
cards.</p>

<p>The difference in the leads at no-trump is covered by a very
simple rule; if you have only two honours in sequence, do not lead
either of them, but begin with the fourth-best, even if your honours
are the Ace and King. But if you have three honours in the suit,
two of them in sequence, always lead an honour against a no-trumper.</p>

<p>The exception to this rule is, that when you are so long in the
suit that you may catch some high cards with your high cards, you
lead them first. With six or seven in suit to the A K, for instance,
lead the King, on the chance of dropping the Queen. With
seven in suit headed by the Ace, lead the Ace, but never with less
than seven without the King. With six in suit, you may lead the
King from K Q, without either Jack or 10; but with less than six
in suit never lead the King from K Q unless you have the 10 or
the J also.</p>

<p><b><i>THIRD HAND PLAY.</i></b> The leader’s partner must do his
best to inform his partner as to the distribution of his suit. The
method of doing this is entirely different when there is a trump
from that which is adopted when there is no trump. In the first
case, all your partner wants to know is, who is going to trump his
suit if he goes on with it. In the second case, what he wants to
know is his chance for getting his suit cleared or established.</p>

<p><b><i>With a Trump.</i></b> When third hand makes no attempt to win
the trick, either because his partner’s or Dummy’s card is better
than any he need play, he plays the higher of two cards only, the
lowest of three or more. This is called playing <i><b>down and out</b></i>.
Suppose third hand holds 7 and 2 only, and the lead is a King.
The 7 is played. The leader goes on with the Ace, denying the
Queen, and the third hand plays the deuce. If the Queen is not in
the Dummy, the declarer must have it. In any case, the leader
knows that if he goes on, his partner, the third hand, can trump
that suit.</p>

<p>With three cards, the lowest falling to the first round, followed
by a higher card, will show the leader that the third hand still has
another of that suit.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to play down and out with an honour, because
the leader can read the situation without it. Suppose third hand
holds the J 5. He plays the 5 to the first round, because one of
his two cards is an honour. The leader goes on with the Ace, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the Jack falls. Now the third hand must have the Queen or no
more, and no matter which it is he can win the third round, with
the Queen or with a trump.</p>

<p><b><i>Against No-Trumpers.</i></b> When there is no trump, the third
hand uses what is called the <i><b>Foster echo</b></i>. This consists in
playing always the <i><b>second-best</b></i> of the suit, when no attempt
is made to win the trick. Suppose the leader begins with the
King. Third hand holds 10 8 7 4, and plays the 8. This marks
him with only one card higher than the 8, and is a great exposer
of false cards played by the declarer.</p>

<p>On the second round, the rule is, always to keep the lowest card
of the suit until the last. If third hand held four originally, 10 8 7 4,
his play to the second round is the 7, keeping the 4. If he held
10 8 7 only, his play to the second round would be the 10, keeping
the 7. This makes it clear to the leader how many and what he
holds.</p>

<p><b><i>High Cards Third Hand.</i></b> When the third hand tries to
win his partner’s lead, he does so as cheaply as possible. That is,
holding both King and Queen, he plays the Queen, not the King.
If his cards are not in sequence, he should always play the best he
has. With Ace and Queen, for instance, he must play the Ace if
the King is not in the Dummy. To play the Queen would be to
throw it away if the declarer has the King. If the leader has the
King, third hand gets out of his way by giving up the Ace.</p>

<p><b><i>FOSTER’S ELEVEN RULE.</i></b> In trying to win tricks as
cheaply as possible, third hand may often be guided by the Eleven
Rule, which can be applied to any lead of a small card.</p>

<p>By deducting from eleven the number of pips on any low card
led by his partner, the pone may ascertain to a certainty how many
cards there are <i><b>higher than the one led</b></i>, which are not in the
leader’s hand. This rule, which was invented by R.F. Foster in
1881, in connection with the game of whist, is now used by everyone
with any pretensions to being a bridge player. The rule itself
is this:&mdash;</p>

<p>When the eldest hand leads any card which is not an honour,
deduct the spots on it from eleven. From the remainder thus found,
deduct the number of cards, <i><b>higher than the one led</b></i>, which are
not in your own hand nor in Dummy’s in that suit. This final remainder
is the number of cards which are in the declarer’s hand
which are higher than the card led. The principal thing to remember
is, that it is only the cards higher than the one led that you
need trouble about. To illustrate:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Suppose you are third hand, and your partner leads the seven of
clubs, Dummy lays down the Q 9 2, and you hold A J 3, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 285px;">
<img src="images/p014.jpg" width="285" height="250" alt="Leader 🃗 Dummy 🃝 🃙 🃒 Third hand 🃑 🃛 🃓" />
</div>

<p>Deducting seven from eleven, you find it leaves four. These
four cards, higher than the one lead, are all in sight, Q 9 in Dummy;
A J in your own hand, therefore the declarer cannot have any card
higher than the seven. If he has, your partner’s lead is not his
fourth-best, as you will see if you lay out the cards.</p>

<p><b><i>RETURNING SUITS.</i></b>  When the third hand returns his
partner’s suit, he should lead the higher of two cards, and the lowest
of three, unless he has a card which will beat anything Dummy
may hold in the suit, in which case he should <i><b>always beat
Dummy</b></i>.</p>

<p><b><i>PLAYING AGAINST DUMMY.</i></b> Some of the fine points
in bridge arise in situations which require a careful consideration
of the Dummy’s cards.</p>

<p>There are three great principles in playing against Dummy:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. Lead through the strong suits, and up to the weak.</p>

<p>2nd. Do not lead through a fourchette.</p>

<p>3rd. Do not lead up to a tenace.</p>

<p>These rules must not be blindly followed in every instance. They
are simply general principles, and some of the prettiest <i><b>coups</b></i> arise
from the exceptional cases.</p>

<p><b><i>Leading Through Dummy.</i></b> The eldest hand, when he does
not deem it advisable to go on with his own suit, may be guided in
his choice by the strength or weakness of certain suits in Dummy’s
hand. The play against Dummy is especially important at no trumps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Suits which it is good policy to lead through are A x x x, K x x x,
or any broken sequences of high cards.</p>

<p>Suits in which Dummy is long, or holds any of the regular high-card
combinations, should be avoided; winning or high sequences
being especially dangerous. To lead such suits through Dummy’s
strength is an invitation to partner to force you in the suit led.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for you to be strong in a suit which you lead
through Dummy; and if you are both weak, is often advantageous;
especially if it avoids leading one of his strong suits.</p>

<p>With A Q 10 x; Dummy having J x x x; play the 10. If partner
has the King you make every trick in the suit.</p>

<p>With A Q 10 x; Dummy having K x x; play the Q. If Dummy
passes, you make two tricks; if he covers, you have tenace over
the Jack.</p>

<p>With A 10 9 x; Dummy having J x x x; play the 10. If partner
has the K, your A 9 is tenace over the Q.</p>

<p>With A J 10 x; Dummy having Q x x x; if the suit must be
led, play the Jack; but such positions should be avoided, except in
the end game, or when you play for every trick.</p>

<p>With A J 10 x; Dummy having no honour in the suit; if you
must lead the suit, play the 10.</p>

<p>In trumps, with K Q x x; Dummy having A J x x; play the
Queen. If Dummy wins with A, play a small card for the second
round, and he may refuse to put on the J. The declarer not having
the 10, would make Dummy cover; but nothing is lost if he does,
and it marks the 10 with your partner.</p>

<p>With King and others of a suit in which Dummy has not the
Ace; avoid leading the suit until the Ace has fallen.</p>

<p>With King alone, play it if Dummy has the Ace; keep it if he
has not.</p>

<p><b><i>Trumps.</i></b> If a player in this position is strong in trumps, he
should keep quiet about it and let the maker of the trumps develop
the suit. False-carding is perfectly legitimate in trumps, and will
deceive the declarer more than your partner.</p>

<p><b><i>End Games.</i></b> There are cases in which it is necessary to play
as if partner was known to possess a certain card, for unless he has
it the game is lost. For instance: You want one trick, and have
Q 10 x x, Dummy having K x x, of an unplayed suit. The Queen
is the best play; for if partner has any honour you must get a trick;
otherwise it is impossible.</p>

<p>You have K x in one suit, a losing card in another, and a winning
card. You want all four tricks to save the game. Play the King,
and then the small card; for if your partner has not the Ace and
another winning card you must lose the game.</p>

<p>You have a losing trump, and Q x x of a suit in which Dummy
has K 10 x. If you want one trick, play the losing trump, counting
on partner for an honour in the plain suit. If you must have two
tricks, lead the Queen, trusting your partner to hold Ace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><b><i>Leading up to Dummy.</i></b> The best thing for the third hand,
or pone, to do, when he does not return his partner’s suit, and has
no very strong suit of his own, is to lead up to Dummy’s weak
suits, and to lead a card that Dummy cannot beat, if possible.</p>

<p>The general principle of leading up to weakness suggests that
we should know what weakness is. Dummy may be considered
weak in suits of which he holds three or four small cards, none
higher than an 8; Ace and one or two small cards; or King and
one or two small cards. In leading up to such suits, your object
should be to give your partner a finesse, if possible; and in calculating
the probabilities of success it must be remembered that
there are only two unknown hands, so that it is an equal chance
that he holds either of two unknown cards. It is 3 to 1 against
his holding both, or against his holding neither. Of three unknown
cards, it is 7 to 1 against his holding all three, or none
of them; or about an equal chance that he holds two of the
three; or one only.</p>

<p>If Dummy holds any of the weak suits just given, you holding
nothing higher than the Ten, you should lead it. Suppose you have
10 9 6; Dummy having A 3 2. The K Q J may be distributed in
eight different ways, in any of which your partner will pass your Ten
if second hand does not cover. In four cases, second hand would
cover with the King, and in one with the Queen and Jack. In the
remaining three your partner’s hand would be benefited.</p>

<p>If Dummy has King and one or two small cards, it is not so
disadvantageous to lead up to the King as would at first appear;
because it is forced out of his hand on the first round, unless
declarer plays Ace, and it is usually good policy to force out
Dummy’s cards of re-entry early in the hand.</p>

<p>In leading from high-card combinations, the usual bridge leads
should be followed; but exceptions must be made on the
second round when certain cards are in Dummy’s hand. For instance:
With A K J and others, it is usual to stop after the first
round, and wait for the finesse of the Jack. This is obviously
useless if the Queen is not in Dummy’s hand. So with K Q 10,
unless Dummy has the Jack; or K Q 9, unless Dummy has the
10. The lead from A Q J should be avoided if Dummy has the
King.</p>

<p>With A Q 10 and others, J in Dummy’s hand, begin with the
Queen.</p>

<p>With A J 9 and others, 10 in Dummy’s hand, lead the Jack.</p>

<p>With A J 10, Dummy having K Q x, play the Jack, and do not
lead the suit again.</p>

<p>In trumps, with K Q and others, if Dummy has the J singly
guarded, begin with the King as usual, but follow it with the
Queen instead of the smallest; for declarer may have passed in
the hope of making a Bath coup with both Ace and Jack. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
plain suits this is a dangerous lead, as declarer having Ace, and
wishing to force Dummy, would hold his Ace as a matter of course.</p>

<p>With short suits, such as K x, Q x; or even with King or Queen
alone, the honour is a good lead if Dummy has no court cards in
the suit. The Queen is rather a better lead than the King, the
only danger being that second hand holds fourchette.</p>

<p>With Q J x, or J 10 x, one of the high cards should be played.
With Q 10 x, Dummy having Ace or King, the Queen should be
led.</p>

<p>With K 10 x, Dummy having Jack, the suit should not be led.</p>

<p>With such combinations as K x x x, Dummy having Q x, the suit
should not be led.</p>

<p>When you have a suit which is both long and strong, such as
A K x x x, and Dummy has no honour in the suit, it is a common artifice
to underplay, by beginning with the smallest, if playing against
no-trumps and you have a card of re-entry. This should not
be done unless you have the general strength to justify such a
finesse.</p>

<p>If you open a long suit, Dummy having only small cards, and
your partner wins with Q, J, or 10, and does not return it, he has
evidently a finesse in the suit and wants it led again.</p>

<p><b><i>End Games.</i></b> In the end game there are several variations
which are made possible by the fact that the cards on your right
are exposed.</p>

<p>With A J x, Dummy having Q x x, the small card should be led.</p>

<p>With Q x, and an odd card, Dummy having K x x of the first
suit; it is better to play the odd card; but if for any reason this
should not be done, lead the Q, hoping to find A 10 with your
partner.</p>

<p>The state of the score must be a constant guide in all end
games. For instance: You hold Q 10 x, Dummy having J 9 x.
If you want only one trick, play the Queen; but if you want two,
play the small card.</p>

<p><b><i>SECOND HAND PLAY.</i></b> The easiest position to play as
second hand, is, of course, with the Dummy on your left, because
Dummy’s cards will show what is best to be done. If a small
card is led, you having King, put it on if Dummy has not the Ace;
unless you want partner to get the lead. If Dummy has only two
cards of the suit, neither of them the Ace, always play your King.</p>

<p>When the declarer leads a suit it is often important to count how
many he and your partner can possibly hold. For instance: You
have four, K x x x; Dummy has four, A J 10 x, and declarer leads
the Queen. It is useless to play your King; for either the Queen
is a singleton, and the declarer cannot continue the suit, which will
compel Dummy to lead it to you eventually; or, the third round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
will be trumped, perhaps by your partner. If you have only two
small cards with the King, put it on the Queen. You cannot save
it, but you may establish your partner’s 9.</p>

<p>In the last three tricks, if you find yourself with a doubtful
card, and the best and a small card of a suit which the declarer
leads through you, win the trick and lead the doubtful card, for
if the declarer held the best of that suit he would have led it
first, to be sure of a trick.</p>

<p><b><i>Dummy on the Right.</i></b> When Dummy leads through
you, your skill in avoiding any traps the declarer may be setting
for you will depend on your knowledge of how he manages his
hand, and your ability to infer what he holds.</p>

<p>As a general principle, it may be assumed that any high card
led by Dummy forms part of a combination, the unseen part of
which is in the declarer’s hand. If Dummy leads a Queen from
Q x x, you holding A J x, it is almost a certainty that the declarer
holds the King. If you have A K x, the dealer must have
J 10 and several others. If you have K x x, the declarer probably
holds Ace, or a long suit headed by J 10.</p>

<p>When Dummy leads strengthening cards, they must be to give
the declarer a finesse. If he leads a small card from small cards,
some high-card combination must be in the declarer’s hand. In
such cases it is useless for you to finesse. If you have any
sequence superior to the card led, cover with the lowest. There
should be no false-carding in this, because your partner is the
only one that can be deceived.</p>

<p>With A K and others, play the King, whatever Dummy leads.</p>

<p>With A Q and others, Dummy having nothing higher than the
9, play the Ace.</p>

<p>With K Q 10, play the Queen on a small card led, unless
Dummy has the Jack.</p>

<p>With A J 10 x, play Ace if Dummy has no honour in the suit.
But if Dummy leads the 9, cover with the 10; if it loses, you lie
tenace over the declarer.</p>

<p>With A J x, play the Jack on a 9 led. This prevents the finesse
of the 9, and retains command of the suit. If Dummy has both
K and Q, play your Ace. It is useless to play the Bath coup, for
the declarer knows your cards, and your partner only is deceived.</p>

<p>With K x x, if Dummy has not the Ace, do not play the King,
no matter what is led.</p>

<p>With Q x x, unless Dummy has both A and K, do not play the
Queen. If your partner has the Jack guarded, one of you must
make a trick. If Dummy has A J, and leads J, put on the Queen;
it may make the 9 or 10 good in your partner’s hand.</p>

<p>With A x x, Dummy leading Jack, play the Ace.</p>

<p>With any fourchette, cover the card led.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>If Dummy remains with one or two small cards of a suit that
has been led, and you have the best, play it on the second round.
Dummy’s play is evidently for the ruff, and if the declarer has not
the second best, your partner has.</p>

<p>If you have King, and only one or two small cards, Dummy
leading Queen from Q 10 x x, play your King. You cannot save
yourself; but you may make the 9 good in partner’s hand. If
you have three or more small cards, do not play the King, for
either partner or the declarer must be short in the suit. So if
Dummy leads Jack from J 10 and others, play the King with a
short suit. If partner has Queen you establish it; if not, you
cannot make a trick in the suit.</p>

<p>With short suits it is usually best to cover an honour with an
honour; but with several small cards, such as K x x x, Dummy
leading a singleton Queen, you should pass.</p>

<p>With K 10 x, Dummy having J and others, play honour on
honour; small card on small card, whichever Dummy leads.</p>

<p>It is often important for the second hand to cover with what is
called an <i><b>imperfect fourchette</b></i>. A true fourchette is the card
immediately above and below the one led; such as K J over the Q,
or Q 10 over the J. An imperfect fourchette is the card above the
one led, and another next but one below it; such as K 10 over a
Q led, or Q 9 over a J led. Covering forces the opponents to play
two honours to win one trick, and will often make an intermediate
card good in your partner’s hand.</p>

<p><b><i>THIRD HAND PLAY.</i></b>  In addition to the methods of
<i><b>echoing</b></i> on the partner’s leads of high cards in the suit first
opened, third hand must be ready to adapt himself and his play to
any change of suit and will require constant practice in putting
himself in his partner’s place, asking himself what the object is in
leading certain cards through Dummy’s hand. The inferences
from the conventional leads should be sufficiently familiar to need
no further explanation; but even good players occasionally overlook
indications that partner holds certain cards. For instance:
A leads a small card; Y, Dummy, holds Q x x, and plays Q. You
play the King and win the trick. This marks not only the Ace,
but the <i><b>Jack</b></i> in partner’s hand; because the declarer would not
play a twice guarded Queen from Dummy’s hand if he had the
Jack guarded himself.</p>

<p>False cards should be avoided by the third hand as much as
possible. The declarer will give your partner enough to puzzle over
without your adding to the confusion. There are some exceptions
in trumps. For instance: You have K Q x; Dummy has A J x x,
and your partner leads. Unless Dummy plays Ace, you should
put on the King, and change the suit.</p>

<p>If you hold Ace and others in a plain suit, partner leading Jack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
pass it if Dummy has no honour. Perhaps by winning the second
round you can give the invited force. With any other honours
than the Ace, pass a partner’s Jack led.</p>

<p>If partner leads you a suit of which he knows, or should know,
you have not the best, he must have a good finesse in the suit
which he does not lead, and you should take the first opportunity
to lead that suit to him.</p>

<p>In returning partner’s suits, some modification may be suggested
by the condition of Dummy’s hand. For instance: With K x x;
Dummy having A Q J x; if you win, third hand, on Dummy’s
finesse, you may be sure your partner’s lead was a weak suit. If
Dummy is weak in the two other plain suits, your partner may have
a good finesse in one or both of them.</p>

<p>When your partner wins the first round of an adverse suit, and
immediately returns it, he is inviting a force.</p>

<p><b><i>Dummy on the Left.</i></b> When the player is third hand with
Dummy on his left, his chief care will be to divine his partner’s
object in leading certain cards up to Dummy.</p>

<p>The general principles of inference are the same as in the preceding
case, and cards may often be inferred in the same manner
from the evident intention of partner. For instance: You hold K
x x; partner leads J, declarer covering with Queen. A glance at
Dummy’s cards shows him to have 10 x x; so your partner may
be credited with A 9. You have x x; your partner leading Q,
covered by declarer with K, and Dummy having J x x. You may
credit your partner with A 10. You have x x; your partner leads
Q and declarer wins with Ace; Dummy holding 10 x x. Your
partner must have J 9 and others, and the declarer has the King.</p>

<p>There are several cases in which you should not allow Dummy
to win the trick. If you have only one card of a suit in which
your partner leads Ace then Queen, and Dummy has the King
twice guarded, trump at once, if you can to prevent Dummy from
getting into the lead. Your partner leads Queen; you holding
A 10 x, and Dummy having K x x. Let the King make on the
first round.</p>

<p>If your partner leads a small card up to strength in Dummy’s
hand, he is either inviting a force, or trying to establish a long
suit. Under such circumstances, if you have the Ace, play it, and
lead a second round of the suit immediately, which will settle the
question.</p>

<p>If you have Q J 10 of a suit in which partner leads King, play the
Jack, so that he will count you for Q or no more, and will not go
on with the Ace.</p>

<p><b><i>IN GENERAL.</i></b> Both the adversaries of Dummy should
adopt the usual tactics for unblocking, etc., especially in no-trumpers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and in some cases Dummy’s exposed cards will make the
matter more simple. For instance: You hold A Q alone, of a
suit which partner leads. If you are the pone, and Dummy has
not the King, play Ace and return the Queen.</p>

<p><b><i>FOURTH HAND.</i></b> There is only one difference from the
usual methods in playing fourth hand, and that is in indicating
sequences by winning with the best and returning the lowest to
show the intermediate cards. For instance: Fourth player, holding
K Q J x, wins with King and returns the Jack. Or with A K Q,
wins with Ace and returns the Queen. The reason for this is that
the declarer gains nothing by the information, for he knows from
the first what cards are out against him; but the information may be
valuable to your partner, the second hand. If it is not the intention
to return the suit at once, the lowest of the sequence should
be played.</p>

<p><b><i>PLAYING TO THE SCORE.</i></b> This is a most important
element, and there is no surer indication of a careless or weak
player than his inattention to the score.</p>

<p>One cannot be too early impressed with the importance of saving
the game before trying to win it; although great risks may be
taken to win a game that cannot be lost that hand.</p>

<p>Never risk a sure contract in the hope of making more; unless
the two will win the game, and the odd trick will not win it.
Never risk a trick that will save the game in the hope of winning
more, and always set a contract while you can.</p>

<p><b><i>DISCARDING.</i></b> This is one of the still unsettled questions
of bridge tactics, some believing in discarding the weak suit
always; others the strong suit always, and others one or the other
according to the declaration. Against a trump declaration almost
every one agrees that it is best to discard the best suit, so that if
your partner gets in before you do, he may have something to
guide him as to what your best chance is for any more tricks.</p>

<p>Against no-trumpers, the majority of players hug every possible
trick in their long suit and discard their weak suits, on the ground
that it is folly to throw away cards that might win tricks. While
this is true, it is also true that in discarding their weak suit they
too often enable the declarer to win tricks that they might have
stopped. For this reason, many players <i><b>discard the suit they
are not afraid of</b></i>; that is, their best protected suit, and keep
what protection they have in the weak suits, even if it is nothing
but three to a Jack or ten. Unfortunately, no one has yet been
able to advance any argument sufficiently convincing for either
system to demonstrate that it is better than the other. Some of
the best teachers of the game advocate the discard from strength
against no-trumps; others teach the weak discard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p><b><i>ENCOURAGING DISCARDS.</i></b> In order to distinguish
between discards from weakness and those from strength,
many players use what is called an encouraging card. This is
anything higher than a six, if they have protection in the suit,
or want it led. A player with an established suit, and A 8 2 of
another suit, for instance, would discard the 8, to encourage his
partner to lead that suit and put him in. In case there is no card
higher than the six, the <i><b>reverse discard</b></i> is used. With A 4 2,
the play would be the 4 and then the 2. Some use this reverse
or encouraging card to induce the partner to continue the suit he
is leading, but the practice is confusing.</p>

<p><b><i>THE DECLARER’S PLAY.</i></b> The chief difference between
the play of the Dummy and partner, and that of their adversaries,
is that there is no occasion for the former to play on
the probability of partner’s holding certain cards, because a
glance will show whether he holds them or not. There is no
hoping that he may have certain cards of re-entry, or strength
in trumps, or that he will be able to stop an adverse suit, or anything
of that sort, for the facts are exposed from the first. Instead
of adapting his play to the slowly ascertained conditions of
partner’s hand, the declarer should have it mapped out and determined
upon before he plays a card. He may see two courses
open to him; to draw the trumps and make a long suit, or to
secure such discards as will give him a good cross-ruff. A rapid
estimate of the probable results of each line of play, a glance at
the score, and his mind should be made up. Several examples
of this foresight will be found in the example hands.</p>

<p>Another point of difference is, that the declarer should play
false cards whenever possible. He has not a partner who, if he
plays the King, might jump to the conclusion that he can trump
a suit, or has not the Queen. The more thoroughly the adversaries
are confused, the greater the advantage to the declarer,
especially in the end game.</p>

<p><b><i>With a Trump.</i></b> When the winning declaration is a suit for
trumps, the declarer’s first consideration upon getting into the
lead must be whether or not to lead trumps. As a rule, the trumps
should be led at once, so as to exhaust the adversaries; but there
are exceptional cases, the principal ones being:&mdash;</p>

<p>Do not lead trumps from the strong trump hand if it would be to
your advantage to put the other hand in the lead with a plain suit,
so as to let the trump lead come from the weaker hand to the
stronger, as when a finesse in trumps is desirable.</p>

<p>Do not lead trumps if you have no good plain suit, and can
make more tricks by playing for a cross-ruff.</p>

<p>Do not lead trumps if the weaker hand can trump some of your
losing cards first. It often happens that a <i><b>losing trump</b></i> can
be used to win a trick before trumps are led.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p><b><i>At No-trump.</i></b> The declarer’s first care in a no-trumper must
be to select the suit that he will play for. Four simple rules cover
this choice:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Always lead from the weak hand to the strong if the suit is
not already established.</p>

<p>2. Play for the suit in which you have the greatest number of
cards between the two hands, because it will probably yield the
greatest number of tricks.</p>

<p>3. If two suits are equal in number, play for the one in which
you have the greatest number of cards massed in one hand. That
is, if you have two suits of eight cards each, select the one that has
six of those cards in one hand, in preference to the suit with four
in each hand.</p>

<p>4. Everything else being equal, play for the suit which is shown
in the Dummy, so as to conceal from the adversaries as long as
possible the strength in your own hand.</p>

<p>A suit is said to be <i><b>established</b></i> when you can win every
remaining trick in it, no matter who leads it. As it is very important
that the hand which is longer in the suit should be able to
lead it without interruption when it is established, good players
make it a rule always to <i><b>play the high cards from the shorter
hand</b></i> first, so as to get out of the way. With Q 10 and three
others in one hand, K J and one other in the other hand, the play is
the K and J from the short hand, keeping the Q 10 in the long hand.</p>

<p>If there is any choice, that suit should be selected which contains
the longest sequence, or the sequence with the fewest breaks.
It should be noticed that the sequence need not be in one hand;
for it is almost as valuable if divided, and it is especially advantageous
to have the higher cards concealed in the declarer’s hand.
Its continuity is the chief point. For instance: Declarer and
Dummy hold between them one suit of K J 9 7 5 4 3, and another
of Q J 10 9 8 7 5. The latter should be selected, because
two leads must establish it.</p>

<p>In establishing a long suit it is very important to note the fall
of the missing cards in the sequences. In the first of the two
combinations just given, the declarer should be as careful to
watch for the fall of the 8 and 6 as for the A Q and 10.</p>

<p><b><i>Leading.</i></b> It is quite unnecessary to follow any system of
leads, further than to distinguish between the combinations from
which high or low cards are led. But it is important to remember
that although a high-card combination may be divided, it
should be played as if in one hand. For instance: The declarer
holds Q J x x x of a suit; Dummy having A x x. By leading Q
or J, Dummy is enabled to finesse, as if he held A Q J. The declarer
holds K J x x x; Dummy having Q x x. The play is to force
the Ace, as if the combination of K Q J x x were in one hand.</p>

<p>Many opportunities arise for leading the Ace first from a short
suit, in order to secure a ruff on the second or third round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p><b><i>Second Hand Play.</i></b> If any card is led by the adversaries
which the fourth hand cannot win, the second hand should cover
it if possible; for unless he does so, his weakness will be exposed,
and the suit will be continued. This is especially true of cases in
which the second hand holds single honours, such as Jack and
others, or Queen and others. Even the King should be played
second hand in such cases, unless it is so well guarded that the
Ace must fall before the King can be forced out.</p>

<p>If the fourth hand can win the card led, it is seldom necessary
to cover second hand. For instance: If the Jack of trumps is
led, the dealer holding Q 9 7 4, and Dummy having A 6 3 2; there
is no need to play the Queen. If the King is in third hand,
such play would establish the Ten. If the King is with the leader,
it or the Ten must make. If Dummy were second hand with the
same cards, Jack being led, he should not play the Ace, for third
hand must play the King to shut out the Queen.</p>

<p>With A Q 9, partner having K and others, it is best to play A
on J led.</p>

<p>If the dealer has Ace and several others of a suit led, Dummy
having only two small cards, a force may be certainly secured by
passing the first round. If Dummy has the Ace, and passes
second hand, the dealer failing to win the trick, the adversaries
will of course see that the play is made in order to force the dealer
on the third round.</p>

<p>If Dummy is weak in trumps, and has only one card of a suit in
which the dealer has Ace and others, the Ace should be played,
and Dummy forced, unless there is a better game.</p>

<p>It is a disadvantage to play in second hand from suits in which
each has a guarded honour. If the dealer has Q x x, and Dummy
has J x, they must make a trick in that suit if they play a small
card second hand, and avoid leading the suit. The same is true
of the adversaries; but they must play on the chance that the
partner has the honour, whereas the dealer knows it.</p>

<p><b><i>Finessing.</i></b> This is a very important part of the strategy of
the game for the dealer. The adversaries of the dealer never
finesse in bridge; but the dealer himself relies upon finessing for
any extra tricks he may want.</p>

<p>A finesse is any attempt to win a trick with a card which is not
the best you hold, nor in sequence with it. Suppose you have
Ace and Queen in the hand which is longer in the suit and
lead from the shorter hand a small card. If you play the Queen,
that is a finesse, because you hope to take a trick with it, although
the King is against you.</p>

<p>It is usually bad play to finesse when there are nine cards
of the suit between the two hands, dealer’s and Dummy’s, because
there is a good chance that the card you wish to finesse against
may fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>When it will be necessary to take two finesses in the same suit,
the lead must come twice from the weaker hand. Suppose the
dealer holds A Q J and others. If the first finesse of the Jack
wins, he should put Dummy in again, so as to take a second finesse
of the Queen. Suppose the dealer holds A J 10, and finesses the
ten the first time. If it falls to the Queen, he should get Dummy
in again, so as to take the second finesse with the Jack. The idea
is to take advantage of the fact that the odds are against both King
and Queen being in one hand. If they are both on the right, one
of them will be played on the small card led from Dummy, and then
the dealer can win it with the Ace and force out the other high card
with his Jack, which will have become one of the second and
third-best of the suit.</p>

<p><b><i>Re-entry Cards.</i></b> After a suit has been <i><b>cleared</b></i>, or established,
it will be necessary to get into the lead with it. For this
purpose the dealer must be careful to preserve a re-entry card in
the hand which is longer in the suit. Suppose that Dummy’s
long suit is clubs, but that the Ace is against him, and that his
only winning card outside is the Ace of diamonds. If diamonds
are led, and the dealer has the Queen, he must let the lead come up
to his hand so as to keep Dummy’s Ace of diamonds for a re-entry
to bring the clubs into play after the Ace has been forced out and
the suit established. Many of the prettiest plays in bridge are in
the management of re-entry cards.</p>

<p><b><i>Underplay.</i></b> When the dealer is afraid of a suit which is
opened against him, and has only one winning card in it, such as
the Ace, he should hold up that card until the third hand has no
more of the suit to lead to his partner. The original leader will
then have to get in himself, because his partner cannot help him;
but if the dealer gave up the Ace on the first trick, it would not
matter which partner got into the lead, they would return to the
suit first opened.</p>

<p><b><i>Ducking.</i></b> This is a method of play by which the dealer hopes to
make his own suit even when the hand that is longer in it has no re-entry
card. Suppose Dummy holds six clubs to the Ace King, and
not another trick in his hand. The dealer has two small clubs only
to lead. If the two winning clubs are led right out, it is impossible to
catch the Q J 10, no matter how those cards lie, therefore the dealer
leads a club, but makes no attempt to win the first round. No
matter what is played by the adversaries he <i><b>ducks</b></i> the first round,
keeping his Ace and King. Next time the dealer gets in, he leads
another club, and now he is able to win the second and third rounds
of the suit, and will probably catch all the adverse cards and establish
it.</p>

<p>The dealer’s play always requires careful planning of the whole
hand in advance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p><b><i>THE NULLO.</i></b> Although not yet in the official laws of
the game, this bid seems to be a popular one with many players.
It is a contract to lose tricks instead of winning them, and
is primarily a defence against overwhelmingly strong no-trumpers.
A bid of three nullos means that the declarer will
force his opponents to win nine tricks, he winning four only,
so that each trick <i><b>under</b></i> seven counts for the nullo player on
his side.</p>

<p><b><i>SCORING.</i></b> There is some difference of opinion as to the
proper value for the nullo, but the general verdict seems to be
to put it just below the no-trumper at 10 a trick, no honours.
Two no-trumps will outbid two nullos. If the adversaries of a
nullo revoke, the declarer can give them three of his tricks, or
take 100 in honours as penalty. If he revokes, they take 100
penalty as usual.</p>

<p><b><i>SUGGESTIONS FOR BIDDING.</i></b> The dealer should
never bid a nullo originally, as it gives his partner no information
as to the distribution of the suits. When any player has
one long suit good for either no trumps or nullos, such as A K
Q 6 4 2, he should “shout,” bidding a trick more than necessary.
Singletons and missing suits are valuable parts of a nullo hand,
as they afford opportunities for discards. It is always dangerous
to bid a nullo without the deuce of the longest suit. If the
dealer bids a spade, his partner may safely bid one nullo, because
the contract is seldom or never obtained for less than two or
three, but he should not persist in the nullo if his partner does
not assist it. The greater the opposition from a no-trumper, the
more probable that the nullo will succeed, but it is a dangerous
declaration in any case. The player with aces and kings is sure
to win tricks, regardless of his partner’s hand, but deuces and
treys are not sure to lose, as the partner may have all high
cards, although not the tops.</p>

<p><b><i>SUGGESTIONS FOR THE PLAY.</i></b> The declarer
should count up the tricks he must win, and as a rule win them
early, bunching his high cards as much as possible. Suits with
two small cards and two high ones must win one trick, but
should escape with that. The great point is to lead losing cards
from one hand and discard dangerous cards in other suits from
the other hand whenever possible.</p>

<p>The opponents of a nullo should lead their shortest suits, so
as to get discards later, keeping their eyes on the dummy and
forcing it to win tricks whenever possible, but never allowing
it to get a discard. The partner’s leads should be returned unless
a singleton can be led at once. It is usual to lead the top
of two cards, the intermediate of three or more, and to avoid
leading suits that are safe, with small cards at the bottom.</p>

<h5>ILLUSTRATIVE AUCTION HANDS.</h5>

<p>Z is the dealer in both instances, but Y makes the winning
declaration, so that B leads for the first trick. The first illustration
is straight auction; the second is a nullo. The underlined
card wins the trick and the card under it is the next one led.</p>

<p>In the first example the dealer, Z, bids a heart. A says one
royal and Y two clubs. This bid of Y’s denies any support for
his partner’s hearts, but shows a supporting minor suit, in case
Z is strong enough to go on with the hearts. B bids two
royals as he can stop the hearts twice and ruff the clubs. Z
cannot pursue the hearts, but shows his supporting minor suit,
bidding three diamonds. This says to Y, “Go no trumps if
you can stop the spades.” When A passes, having bid his
hand on the first round, Y goes two no trumps and makes
game. B leads the top of his partner’s declared suit, and A
leads a fourth round, hoping to get in with the club jack. At
tricks 8 and 9, B signals control in hearts. A keeps the protection
in clubs to the end and saves a trick by it. Y keeps two
clubs in dummy, so that if club is led, he will have one to return
after he has made his diamonds.</p>

<p>In the second example, they are playing nullos, Y declaring.
The points in the play are holding the spade queen, so as to
lead a diamond or a spade at trick 6. This B prevents, hoping
to force two clubs on Y and Z and set the contract. At trick
7, if the hearts are split, the queen must win the ten. If not,
Z must win one heart trick. Y makes his contract, losing four
odd.</p>

<h4>BRIDGE.</h4>

<p>The difference between straight bridge, as it is sometimes
called, and auction is in the method of selecting the trump, which
must be declared by the dealer or his partner, the opponents
having nothing to say except to double the declaration if they
think it will not win the odd trick. Another point is that either
side can score toward game by getting the odd trick or more,
there being no penalties for failure to make the odd except losing
the value of the tricks because the dealer never declares to make
any given number of tricks on the hand.</p>

<p>There are some irregularities which are peculiar to straight
bridge that would not apply to auction. These are fully covered
by the following description of the game, all other matters, such
as the correct card to lead and the manner of combining the
hands, have been fully described in connection with auction.</p>

<p><i><b>MAKING THE TRUMP.</b></i> This is the chief peculiarity
in bridge. The trump is not turned up, but the suit is named by
the dealer or his partner, after they have examined their cards.
In order properly to understand the considerations which guide
them in making the trump, one should first be familiar with the
values attached to the tricks when certain suits are trumps. The
first six tricks taken by one side do not count; but each trick
above that number counts toward game according to the following
table:&mdash;</p>

<p>Better to understand the importance of this variation in value,
it should be noticed that the game is 30 points; so that if two
partners won 3 by cards with no trump, or 4 by cards with hearts
for trumps, they would win the game in one deal. On the other
hand, if either of the black suits were trumps, they could not lose
the game, even if a slam were made against them.</p>

<p>It will thus be evident that two considerations influence the
player whose privilege it is to make the trump: First, to win as
much as possible, if he has the cards to do it. Second, to save
himself, if he is weak; or the game, if it is in danger. As a general
proposition, it may be said that his decision will be indicated
by the colour of the trump he names. If it is red, he is strong, and
plays to win; if it is black, he is taking to the woods. A further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
element may enter into his calculations, the state of the score. If
he feels sure of the few points necessary to win the game or the
rubber with a black trump, there is no necessity to risk making it
red. This is a part of the subject which we shall go into further
when we come to the suggestions for good play.</p>

<p>The dealer has the first say in making the trump. If he does
not feel himself strong enough to make it no trump, or red, although
his hand may be black enough to promise a good score in clubs or
spades, he should transfer to his partner the privilege of making
the trump by saying: “I leave it to you, partner.” Guided by this
indication, his partner must fix on some suit for the trump or go
no-trumps, and must announce it.</p>

<p>Either the dealer or his partner may elect to play without a
trump, if he has sufficient strength in all the suits to do so.</p>

<p><i><b>IRREGULARITIES IN DECLARING.</b></i> If the
dealer’s partner makes a declaration before being asked to do
so, either adversary may demand that the declaration shall stand,
or that there shall be a new deal. In England, only the eldest
hand, A, may exact the penalty. If the dealer’s partner passes
the declaration to the dealer, either adversary may claim a new
deal or may insist that the player in error shall make the declaration.
In England, the eldest hand exacts this penalty.</p>

<p>Should an adversary of the dealer make a declaration, the dealer
may, after looking at his own hand, either have a new deal or proceed
as if nothing had been said.</p>

<p><i><b>SETTLING THE VALUE OF THE TRICKS.</b></i> The
trump suit having been announced, the first hand or leader, A, before
he plays a card, has the privilege of doubling the value of the
tricks if he thinks the opponents cannot win the odd trick with the
trump named. To do this, he simply says: “I double.” If he
does not feel justified in doubling, he transfers the opportunity to
his partner, by asking him: “Shall I play?” That is to say,
“shall we play without doubling?” If his partner will not double,
he answers: “Yes.” Either A or B having doubled, it becomes
the privilege of the player who made the trump to double him again;
making the value of the trick four times greater than that given
in the table. If he does not do so, he says: “I pass”; and his
partner then has the privilege. If either the dealer or his partner
doubles, the adversary who first doubled may repeat it; or if he
passes, his partner may double. This doubling may be continued
until the value of each trick over the book is 100 points, when it
must cease.</p>

<p><i><b>IRREGULARITIES IN DOUBLING.</b></i> If the pone
doubles before his partner has asked him “Shall I play?” the
maker of the trump shall say whether or not the double shall
stand. If he allows it to stand it may be redoubled. Should
a player redouble out of turn, the one whom he redoubles shall
have the right to say whether or not the redouble shall stand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Any consultation between partners as to doubling or redoubling
will entitle their adversaries to insist on a new deal.</p>

<p>If the eldest hand leads without asking his partner’s permission
to play, the pone cannot double without the consent of the maker
of the trump. Should the pone ask the eldest hand, “Shall I
play?” that does not deprive the eldest hand of the right to
double.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The trump suit and the value
of the tricks settled, the player on the dealer’s left begins by leading
any card he pleases. After he has played, the second player,
Y, lays his hand face up on the table, and takes no further part in
the play beyond availing himself of the privilege of asking his partner
if he has none of a suit to which he renounces. From the moment
that Y’s cards are exposed the game becomes Dummy, the
dealer, Z, playing Y’s cards for him.</p>

<p>The dealer gathers the tricks for his side; either adversary may
gather for the other. The first six tricks taken by one side make
a “book” and all over six count toward game. The tricks should be
so laid that they can be readily counted by any player at the table.</p>

<p><i><b>The Revoke.</b></i> Should a player fail to follow suit when able
to do so, it is a revoke. Dummy cannot revoke under any circumstances;
but the penalty for any other player is the loss of three
tricks for each revoke made, which are taken from the side in error
at the end of the hand. In England, the penalty may be exacted
in any of three ways; three tricks, or the value of three tricks in
points, or the addition of a like amount to opponent’s score. A slam
cannot be scored if the tricks necessary to make it were taken for
the revoke penalty. The side making a revoke cannot win the
game that hand, no matter what they score; but they may play the
hand out, and count all they make to within two points of game, or
28. Players cannot score a slam in a hand in which they have
revoked.</p>

<p><i><b>Exposed Cards.</b></i> If the dealer or his partner exposes a
card before the declaration has been made, either adversary may
claim a new deal. If any player exposes a card before the first card
is led, his partner forfeits the right to double or redouble. If the
pone exposes a card in this manner, the dealer may call it an exposed
card, or he may require the eldest hand not to lead that suit.</p>

<p>If, during the play of the hand, either adversary of the dealer exposes
a card, by playing two cards at once, dropping one face up on
the table, or holding it so that his partner can see any portion of its
face, the card so exposed must be left face upward on the table, and
is liable to be called.</p>

<p>Exposed cards can be called by the dealer at any time, but he
cannot compel the play of a card which would constitute a revoke.</p>

<p><i><b>Leading Out of Turn.</b></i> If either of the dealer’s adversaries
lead out of turn, the dealer may either call the card exposed, or
may call a suit when it is the turn of either adversary to lead. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the dealer leads out of turn, there is no penalty, but he cannot
correct the error if the second hand has played.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards Played in Error.</b></i> If any player but the Dummy
omits to play to a trick and does not correct the error until he has
played to the next trick, his adversaries may claim a new deal. If
any one, excepting Dummy, plays two cards to a trick and does
not discover it, he is responsible for any revokes that he may make
in consequence of not having the card in his hand.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECT OF THE GAME.</b></i> As in all members of the
whist family, the object in Bridge is to win tricks, the highest card
played of the suit led winning, and trumps, if any, winning against
all other suits. At the end of each hand the side that has won any
tricks in excess of the book, scores them, after multiplying their
number by the unit of value settled upon by the doubling, if any
took place. As soon as either side reaches or passes 30, they win
the game; but the hand must be played out, and all tricks taken
must be counted. The total is written on the score-sheet; the score
of the losers standing to their credit until the final accounting at the
end of the rubber.</p>

<p><i><b>RUBBERS.</b></i> Three games, of 30 points each, constitute a
rubber; but if the first two are won by the same players, the
third is not played. The side winning the majority of the games
adds 100 (rubber) points to its score.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> The points
which the beginner may profitably study in Bridge are chiefly in
making the trump, and in the methods by which the hands of the
partners are combined, so as to work together.</p>

<p><i><b>Making the Trump.</b></i> The bridge player’s first consideration
should be the state of the score, which will show how many
points he needs to win the game. Let us suppose this number to
be 12, he having already scored 18. These 12 points can be made
by winning six by cards with spades for trumps; three by cards
with clubs; or two by cards with diamonds or hearts. But if
the hand can be played without a trump, the odd trick wins the
game.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that a player would be very foolish
to engage himself to win six by cards if the odd trick would equally
answer his purpose; nor would he undertake to win three by cards
with clubs for trumps, if he had as good a chance of making two
by cards with diamonds or hearts. In other words, the player
should not make the trump which promises the greatest number of
tricks, but should select that which will yield the largest number of
points.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that every good player first considers the
advisability of making it “no-trump,” and if he thinks that injudicious,
hearts or diamonds, leaving the black suits as a last resort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the custom invariably to make it no-trump with three Aces,
unless the hand is strong enough for a heart make, or holds great
honour value in red.</p>

<p>In estimating the probabilities of trick-taking, it is usual to count
the partner for three tricks on the average. Conservative players
do not depend on him for more than two. Generally speaking,
the maker of the trump should have four pretty certain tricks in
his own hand.</p>

<p>The dealer should seldom announce a black trump unless he has
a certainty of the game in his own hand, without any assistance
from his partner, or unless he has such a poor hand that he must
make it a “defensive spade.” If he cannot safely make it no-trump
or red, he should pass, and allow his partner the chance. With
such a hand as seven clubs, including four honours, and absolutely
worthless cards otherwise, the dealer should make it clubs, except
when the adversaries have won the first game, and are about 20
points in the second. This makes it not unlikely that they will win
the rubber on the next hand with their deal. Under such circumstances
the dealer must invariably leave it to his partner, in the
hope that he can save the rubber by making it no-trump.</p>

<p>The dealer’s partner should be aware that there cannot be any
reasonable hope of four tricks in red in the leader’s hand, or a red
trump would have been announced; and unless he has at least
five probable tricks in his own hand he should not make it red.
With three Aces he should make it no-trump. Four Aces is always
a no-trumper, no matter what the rest of the hand may be.
If he is obliged to make it black, and has three or four probable
tricks, he should announce whichever suit he is best in. Attention
should be paid to the score; for in many instances the suit must
be selected so that the adversaries cannot win the game with the
odd trick, even if they double.</p>

<p><i><b>Doubling.</b></i> The dealer or his partner having announced the
trump, the adversary should carefully consider the score before
doubling or playing. Most players consider themselves justified
in doubling when they have six reasonably certain tricks in their
own hands, trusting partner for one only. Great caution should
be used in doubling no-trumpers, the position of the lead being carefully
studied; because the odd trick usually settles the fate of the
game when a no-trumper is doubled. While a player with the
lead, and seven certain tricks in one suit, should double a no-trumper,
his partner would be very foolish to do so, unless he had,
in addition to his long suit, the heart ace; for it is a conventionality
of the game for A to lead hearts if B doubles a no-trumper.</p>

<p>The original maker of the trump should be very strong to justify
him in redoubling the adversary. If he had four probable tricks
originally, he may count the adversary who doubles for five, and
of the four doubtful tricks remaining, the odds are against partner
having the three which would be necessary to win the odd trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Opening Leads.</b></i> The first lead must necessarily be made in
the dark, but the selection of the suit will often depend on the
trump, and whether it was named by the dealer or by his partner.</p>

<p>If the dealer has made it red, and A has the A K of any plain
suit, he should play the King, so as to retain the lead until Dummy’s
hand is exposed.</p>

<p>If the dealer passes it to his partner, he is probably weak in red.
If Y makes it hearts, A should lead a supporting diamond, unless
he has strength in another suit. If Y has made it diamonds, A
should lead a supporting heart. But in either case, if A has in his
hand such cards as A K, even of a black suit, he should play the
King, and wait to see the Dummy’s hand. If Y has made it black,
A must be guided by his own cards, but should give a red suit the
preference for his opening lead.</p>

<p>Details as to the correct card to lead and the play after the
opening lead have been fully covered in connection with auction
bridge, which see.</p>

<p>The discard is usually coupled with the system of opening
against a doubled no-trumper. If your partner says he is “<i><b>heart
and strong</b></i>” he means that if you double a no-trumper and he
is eldest hand, he will lead you his best heart, and that he will discard
his strong suit when playing against a no-trumper. If he
says he is “<i><b>heart and weak</b></i>,” he will lead the top heart; but he
will discard his weak suit. If he says he is “<i><b>weak and weak</b></i>,”
he means that he will lead the shortest or weakest suit in his hand,
if you double no-trumps, that being the almost universal custom
in England.</p>

<p>All the situations which have been covered in the play of the
second, third and fourth hands at auction can be studied with
advantage by the bridge player, as the manner of securing the
best results from certain distributions of the cards is the same
in both games. The chief difference lies in the value of the
tricks, because at bridge the opponents of the declaration can
score toward game, and it is therefore frequently advisable to
take a finesse or make a play that would be quite unjustifiable
at auction, if there is any chance that such a play may win a
game that would be otherwise impossible.</p>

<p>Close attention to the score is an important factor in bridge
which does not operate in auction, because in that game any
previous score toward game is seldom of any use, eighteen out
of every twenty deals being game hands or nothing, and the
dealer having no more advantage in the selection of the trump
than any other player. In bridge, one always calculates that the
dealer will go out if he is 18 or 20 up on the score, as almost
any suit will do. This prompts the side that has the deal, or a
chance to go game, to lose no opportunity to win at once, before
the other side gets a chance at it.</p>

<p>The first of these examples shows the importance of playing for
the suit which is longest between the two hands. Observe that
the dealer plays the high cards from the hand which is shorter
in the suit, and on the second round of clubs is careful to give up
the higher of two cards, so as to get out of Dummy’s way and
clear, or establish, the suit. B, hoping to get his partner into the
lead again, leads a heart up to Dummy’s weakness, and leads a heart
which will beat Dummy’s best heart. At the eleventh trick, unless
the dealer can make two tricks in spades by the finesse, he cannot
win the game.</p>

<p>The second example shows the importance of preserving a re-entry
card in the hand which is longer in the suit the dealer intends
playing for. If the dealer lets the heart come up to him, it is true
that he will make win the first trick with the Jack; but he will never
win a trick with the Queen, and therefore he can never get in to
make his clubs, even if he establishes them. By putting up the
Ace of hearts, and keeping both Q and J in his own hand, he is
certain of a re-entry in hearts. On the second round of clubs, the
adversary still holding up or underplaying, the dealer must be careful
to overtake Dummy’s ten with his own Jack, so as to continue
the suit without losing the lead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<h5>VARIETIES OF BRIDGE.</h5>

<p><i><b>THREE HAND AUCTION.</b></i> This is a game for three
active players only, but four may form a table. Each player
is for himself, there being no partnerships except the temporary
combination against the declarer for each deal. The player who
cuts the lowest card chooses his seat and cards and the player
with the next lower cut sits on his left, the other on his right.</p>

<p>The cards are dealt one at a time into four packets, of thirteen
each, just as in the ordinary game of auction, the odd hand remaining
untouched until the winning declaration is decided.
The dealer makes the first bid and then each bids in turn until
two pass. The penalty for bidding out of turn is 50 points added
to the score of each opponent, for doubling out of turn it is 100.
If both pass the irregularity there is no penalty, but if only one
passes, the third may call attention to it.</p>

<p>The highest bidder takes up the dummy hand, sorts it and
lays it on the table opposite him, face up, as soon as the eldest
hand leads a card. If there is a player sitting opposite the highest
bidder, he moves to the vacant seat.</p>

<p>The game is 30 points, and the winner of a game adds 125
points to his score at once. The first player to win two games
not only adds the 125 for the second game, but 250 more for
winning the rubber. Honours are scored by each player separately,
every honour being worth as much as a trick in that suit. Four
or five in one hand count double. At no trump, the aces count
for 10 each to the holders, four in one hand 100. The declarer
scores his dummy’s honours.</p>

<p>At the end of the rubber, each wins from or loses to each
of the others. The score is usually made up in this way, the
final amounts to the credit of each being shown in the top line:</p>

<p><i><b>DUPLICATE AUCTION.</b></i> This game may be played in
any of the ways described for the movement of trays and players
under the head of duplicate whist. Tricks and honours are scored
as usual, but there are no games or rubbers. Should the declarer
make 30 or more points on a single hand he gets 125 points bonus
in the honour column. This game is now covered by the official
laws for auction, which see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>BRIDGE FOR THREE.</b></i> Sometimes called <i><b>Dummy
Bridge</b></i>, or <i><b>Cut-Throat</b></i>. The lowest cut deals the first hand
and plays the Dummy. If the dealer will not declare on his
own cards, he passes, and Dummy must declare according to a
fixed schedule. With three or four aces; no-trumps, no matter
what the rest of the hand may be. With less than three aces,
Dummy cannot make it no-trumps under any circumstances; but
must name the longest suit. If two suits are equal, the pips on
each are counted, reckoning aces as 11 each, other honours at 10
each, and the larger number of pips is the suit. If this is still
equal, the more valuable suit must be declared.</p>

<p>No one but the eldest hand may double, and no one but the
dealer may redouble. In order to make this fair for both sides,
it is usual to let the pone sort and declare on Dummy’s cards, so
that the dealer shall not see them until the first card is led.</p>

<p>No matter what points are made for tricks, the dealer only can
score them below the line, to count toward game. If the adversaries
make the odd trick, they score above the line, in the honour
column, so that no one can go out except on his own deal.</p>

<p>After the deal is finished and scored, the players move, so as to
bring about a change of partners. The one on the left of the
vacant place moves into it, and the player on his right deals.
Three of these movements bring about the original position.</p>

<p>Each player’s score is kept individually, and when one of the
three has won two games, the scores are added up and balanced,
after giving the winner 100 rubber points. Each then pays the
difference to the others. Suppose the winner to be A, with 320;
B having 80 and C 64. A wins 240 from B and 256 from C;
while B wins 16 from C.</p>

<p><i><b>BRIDGE FOR TWO.</b></i> Sometimes called “<i><b>Chinese
Bridge</b></i>.” The dealer gives his adversary four cards face down,
and then deals four to himself, also face down. He then distributes
the remainder of the pack by dealing to his adversary
and himself alternately, one card at a time, keeping them separate
from the first four. Without lifting or looking at any of these
twenty-two cards, each player places eleven of them in two rows,
face down, and then the other eleven on the top of the first, but
face up. This gives each player eleven cards face up on the table,
covering eleven face down under them, and a separate hand of four
cards.</p>

<p>The dealer looks at his four cards, without showing them to his
adversary, and after due consideration of what he sees on the table,
declares. His adversary can double if he likes, or he can simply
play a card. Tricks and honours count as in the ordinary rubber.</p>

<p>The declaration made, the non-dealer leads any card he pleases,
from the four in his hand or from the eleven face up on the table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and the dealer must follow suit if he can, either from his hand or
from the table. The moment a card is played from the table, the
card under it must be turned face up, and becomes playable; but
no card which is on the top of another card can be shifted, so that
the card under it cannot be turned up until its covering card is legitimately
played away.</p>

<p>The second player having played to the trick, the original leader
must play to it in his turn, and then his adversary plays the fourth
card, completing the trick. The winner of the trick takes it in,
turns it down, and leads for the next trick, and so on until all
thirteen tricks have been played. The winner of the rubber scores
100 points extra.</p>

<p><i><b>MISERY BRIDGE.</b></i> This is a game for two players, who
sit opposite each other. Four hands of thirteen cards each are
dealt, the dealer beginning on his left. Before declaring, the
dealer may discard any number of cards from one to four, laying
them on the table at his left, but face up, where they so remain
during the play of the hand.</p>

<p>In place of this discard, the dealer takes an equal number of
cards from the top of the hand on his left. These are not shown
to the adversary. Having discarded and drawn, the dealer declares.
There is no doubling; but the dealer himself may undertake
to win at least eight of the thirteen tricks, and if he announces
“eight tricks,” he can score them at double value if he succeeds.
If he fails to get the full eight, his adversary scores ten points
penalty, the dealer scoring nothing at all. No matter what the
trump suit, the penalty of ten points remains the same.</p>

<p>After discarding, drawing and declaring, the stock hand is laid
aside, still face down, and the non-dealer takes up and sorts the
hand on his left, turning it face up on the table, like a Dummy.
This hand belongs to the non-dealer, who leads first and plays both
hands, so that the dealer is practically opposed to two hands of
thirteen cards each.</p>

<p>If the dealer does not want to discard and draw, he can play
<i><b>misery</b></i>, which is a no-trumper, but played to lose tricks, instead
of to win them. If the dealer takes more than one trick, his adversary
scores five points penalty for each so taken. But if the
dealer succeeds in taking only one trick, or none at all, he scores
five points for every trick his adversary has taken over the book of
six.</p>

<p><i><b>PIVOT BRIDGE.</b></i> This is simply a movement of the players,
very popular in social games, which requires that the four
originally seated at a table shall remain at that table until the game
is ended, and shall not cut for partners after the first rubber, but
change in regular order. The usual way is for the first dealer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
sit still all the time, the three other players moving round her in a
circle at the end of each rubber. This will compel the player on
her left to pass behind her and take the seat on her right. At the
end of three rubbers, each will have had each of the others for a partner.
When there are a number of tables in play, it will be necessary
to have a prize for each, giving the first choice to the player
who has the highest score in the room.</p>

<p>When this method is adopted, it is not necessary to deduct the
lower score from the higher at the end of each rubber, so that each
player can keep what she gets, the comparative result being the
same if the players remain at the same table. This method is open
to the objection that if two strong players are opposed to weak ones
all the time, it is a great advantage. It is also liable to abuse, if
four players agree to double everything, so that some one at the
table shall be high score.</p>

<p><i><b>PROGRESSIVE BRIDGE.</b></i> This is simply a movement
of the players from table to table, much as described under the
heading of <i><b>compass whist</b></i>. The players may either agree that
all the N &amp; S pairs shall sit still, all the E &amp; W pairs moving one
table; or they may arrange for the winners to move in a certain
direction. In all progressive games, sometimes called <i><b>Drive
Bridge</b></i>, there are no rubbers or games, as one table would keep
all the others waiting. An even number of deals, usually four, is
the rule for each round before moving.</p>

<p><i><b>DUPLICATE BRIDGE.</b></i> This is bridge with the hands
kept separate and put into trays to be carried from table to table.
The methods will be found fully described under the titles for duplicate
whist. In order to prevent the players from giving too much
attention to the honours in declaring, it is sometimes the rule to add
a certain number of points to the trick scores, as a bonus. This is
called <i><b>Bridge to the Score</b></i>. Four deals is a round, before changing
adversaries, and fifty points are added to the score of the side
having the greater trick score. Another method is to add fifty
points to the side winning a game, if a game is won before moving,
and then to add a definite number of points for every trick point
that one side may be ahead of the other on unfinished games; or as
many points as the higher score below the line.</p>

<p>None of these methods have proved attractive enough to be popular,
however, although the first is the one commonly adopted for
club tournaments, adding fifty points bonus for the higher trick
score, regardless of any games or rubbers. All the additions of percentages
require special score cards and the services of some alleged
expert to run the game, and even then they are not attractive.
The problem of duplicate bridge remains as yet unsolved, so far as
a popular game is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>SIX-HAND BRIDGE.</b></i> This is played by six persons, sitting
with two card tables pushed together so as to make one. Each
dealer sits at the long end of the table, the two dealers being partners.
On each side of one sits a pair of adversaries so that the
initial arrangement, if pair A had the deal, would be this:&mdash;</p>

<p>Numbers are placed on the tables to indicate the positions to
which the players shall move after each deal. The player at 6 goes
to 5; 4 to 3; 3 to 2; 2 to 1, and 1 to 6. Each pair of partners, as
they fall into the end seats, have the deal.</p>

<p>If the dealer at either end will not declare on his own cards, he
passes it, and the Dummy hand opposite him must be handed to
the dealer that sits at the other end of the long table, who must declare
for his partner. The usual four hands are dealt and played
at each table, and scored as usual.</p>

<p>Three scores must be kept, because there are three separate rubbers
going on at once,&mdash;that between A and B; between A and C,
and between B and C. If one pair wins its rubber against one of
the others, three players will be idle at one end of the table for one
deal, but then all will come into play again, for the next deal. Some
persons think this is better than four playing a rubber while two
look on.</p>

<p><i><b>DOUBLE DUMMY BRIDGE.</b></i> In this form of the game,
the dealer always deals for himself. His adversary sits next him
on the left for the first deal, and leads for the first trick before the
Dummies are exposed. There is no doubling. On the next deal,
the adversary must sort his Dummy’s hand and must lead from it,
before looking at his own. If the declaration is passed, Dummy
must make it on the lines laid down for passed makes in Bridge for
Three, which has already been described. There is no penalty for
a revoke made by either Dummy; but otherwise the laws of bridge
govern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>DRAW BRIDGE.</b></i> This is double Dummy; but instead of
laying Dummy’s cards face up on the table, each player is provided
with a holder in which he places his partner’s cards in such a manner
that his adversary cannot see them. As it comes to Dummy’s turn
to play to each trick, a card is drawn from the holder. All four
hands are responsible for revokes.</p>

<p><i><b>KING’S BRIDGE.</b></i> This is sometimes called <i><b>Four Hand
Bridge</b></i>, each player being for himself. The movements of the
players are the same as those described in Pivot Bridge, one player
sitting still all the time, while each of the others in turn becomes
his partner for four deals.</p>

<p>The dealer declares. If he passes, the player sitting opposite him
must make it according to the mechanical rules given in Bridge
for Three. There is no doubling. The score of each player is
kept in a separate column, and the trick and honour score is put
down in one lump, plus or minus, the new score being added to or
deduced from the previous one. It is simpler, however, to put
down nothing but the plus scores, so that when the declaration is
defeated, the points are credited to each of the three other players.
Suppose the dealer wins 16 and 16. He is put down as 32 plus. If
he should lose 12 and 30, his score would not be touched, but each
of the others would be put down 42 plus.</p>

<p>There are no games or rubbers. At the end of four deals the
players change partners by the pivot system. At the end of twelve
deals, each has played four deals with each of the others. The
scores are then added up and balanced by the method described in
connection with the game of Skat.</p>

<p><i><b>REVERSI BRIDGE.</b></i> This is playing bridge to lose, and
the object of the declaration is to pick out the make which is likely
to win the least tricks. At the end of the hand, each side scores
what the other makes; so that if the dealer declares no-trumps, and
loses two by cards, and finds thirty aces against him, he scores 24
and 30 to his own credit. The adversaries can double if they wish
to, and all the rules of regular bridge apply, except that if a revoke
is made the usual penalty is reversed, the player in error taking three
tricks instead of losing them.</p>

<p><i><b>SHORT BRIDGE.</b></i> This is bridge without any doubling or
rubbers, and is played for so much a game instead of for so much a
point, the winners being the side that has the higher score for
tricks and honours combined when either side reaches thirty points
below the line. It is a good game for occasions upon which the
players may be interrupted at any time, or have not time to finish
a full rubber.</p>

<h5>THE AMERICAN LAWS OF BRIDGE.</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Revised to November, 1913.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Reprinted and Copyrighted, 1913, by permission of The Whist
Club of New York.</i></p>

<h6>THE RUBBER.</h6>

<p>1. The partners first winning two games win the rubber.
When the first two games decide the rubber, a third is not played.</p>

<h6>SCORING.</h6>

<p>2. Each side has a trick score and a score for all other counts,
generally known as the honour score. In the trick score the only
entries made are points for tricks won (see Law 3), which count
both toward the game and in the total of the rubber.</p>

<p>All other points, including honours, penalties, slam, little slam,
and under-tricks, are recorded in the honour score, which counts
only in the total of the rubber.</p>

<p>3. When the declarer wins the number of tricks bid or more,
each above six counts on the trick score; two points when spades
are trumps, six when clubs are trumps, seven when diamonds are
trumps, eight when hearts are trumps, nine when royal spades are
trumps, and ten when the declaration is no trump.</p>

<p>4. A game consists of thirty points made by tricks alone. Every
deal is played out, whether or not during it the game be concluded,
and any points made (even if in excess of thirty) are
counted.</p>

<p>5. The ace, king, queen, knave, and ten of the trump suit are the
honours; when no trump is declared, the aces are the honours.</p>

<p>6. Honours are credited to the original holders; they are valued
as follows:</p>

</table>

<p>7. Slam is made when partners take thirteen tricks.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It counts
40 points in the honour score.</p>

<p>8. Little slam is made when partners take twelve tricks.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It
counts 20 points in the honour score.</p>

<p>9. The value of honours, slam, or little slam, is not affected by
doubling or redoubling.</p>

<p>10. At the conclusion of a rubber the trick and honour scores
of each side are added and 250 additional points added to the
score of the winners of the rubber. The size of the rubber is
the difference between the completed scores. If the score of the
losers of the rubber exceed that of the winners, the losers win the
amount of the excess.</p>

<p>11. When a rubber is started with the agreement that the play
shall terminate (<i>i.e.</i>, no new deal shall commence) at a specified
time, and the rubber is unfinished at that hour, the score is made
up as it stands, 125 being added to the score of the winners of a
game. A deal if started must be finished.</p>

<p>12. A proved error in the honour score may be corrected at any
time before the score of the rubber has been made up and agreed
upon.</p>

<p>13. A proved error in the trick score may be corrected at any
time before a declaration has been made in the following game,
or, if it occur in the final game of the rubber, before the score has
been made up and agreed upon.</p>

<h6>CUTTING.</h6>

<p>14. In cutting the ace is the lowest card; between cards of
otherwise equal value the heart is the lowest, the diamond next,
the club next, and spade the highest.</p>

<p>15. Every player must cut from the same pack.</p>

<p>16. Should a player expose more than one card, the highest
is his cut.</p>

<h6>FORMING TABLES.</h6>

<p>17. Those first in the room have the prior right to play. Candidates
of equal standing decide their order by cutting; those
who cut lowest play first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>18. Six players constitute a complete table.</p>

<p>19. After the table has been formed, the players cut to
decide upon partners, the two lower play against the two
higher. The lowest is the dealer, who has choice of cards
and seats, and, having made his selection, must abide by it.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>20. The right to succeed players as they retire is acquired
by announcing the desire to do so, and such announcements, in
the order made, entitle candidates to fill vacancies as they occur.</p>

<h6>CUTTING OUT.</h6>

<p>21. If, at the end of a rubber, admission be claimed by one
or two candidates, the player or players who have played the
greatest number of consecutive rubbers withdraw; when all
have played the same number, they cut to decide upon the
outgoers; the highest are out.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<h6>RIGHT OF ENTRY.</h6>

<p>22. At the end of a rubber a candidate is not entitled to
enter a table unless he declare his intention before any player
cut, either for partners, for a new rubber, or for cutting out.</p>

<p>23. In the formation of new tables candidates who have
not played at an existing table have the prior right of entry.
Others decide their right to admission by cutting.</p>

<p>24. When one or more players belonging to an existing
table aid in making up a new one, which cannot be formed
without him, he or they shall be the last to cut out.</p>

<p>25. A player belonging to one table who enters another,
or announces a desire to do so, forfeits his rights at his original
table, unless the new table cannot be formed without him
in which case he may retain his position at his original table
by announcing his intention to return as soon as his place at
the new table can be filled.</p>

<p>26. Should a player leave a table during the progress of a
rubber, he may, with the consent of the three others, appoint
a substitute to play during his absence; but such appointment
becomes void upon the conclusion of the rubber, and does
not in any way affect the rights of the substitute.</p>

<p>27. If a player break up a table, the others have a prior
right of entry elsewhere.</p>

<h6>SHUFFLING.</h6>

<p>28. The pack must not be shuffled below the table nor so the
face of any card be seen.</p>

<p>29. The dealer’s partner must collect the cards from the
preceding deal and has the right to shuffle first. Each player<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
has the right to shuffle subsequently. The dealer has the right
to shuffle last, but should a card or cards be seen during his
shuffling or while giving the pack to be cut, he must reshuffle.</p>

<p>30. After shuffling, the cards, properly collected, must be placed
face downward to the left of the next dealer, where they
must remain untouched until the end of the current deal.</p>

<h6>THE DEAL.</h6>

<p>31. Players deal in turn; the order of dealing is to the left.</p>

<p>32. Immediately before the deal, the player on the dealer’s
right cuts, so that each packet contains at least four cards.
If, in or after cutting and prior to the beginning of the deal,
a card be exposed, or if any doubt exist as to the place of the
cut, the dealer must reshuffle and the same player must cut again.</p>

<p>33. After the pack has been properly cut, it should not be
reshuffled or recut except as provided in Law 32.</p>

<p>34. Should the dealer shuffle after the cut, his adversaries
may also shuffle and the pack must be cut again.</p>

<p>35. The fifty-two cards must be dealt face downward. The
deal is completed when the last card is dealt.</p>

<p>36. In the event of a misdeal, the same pack must be dealt
again by the same player.</p>

<h6>A NEW DEAL.</h6>

<p>37. There <i>must</i> be a new deal:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) If the cards be not dealt, beginning at the dealer’s
left into four packets one at a time and in regular
rotation.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) If, during a deal, or during the play the pack be
proved incorrect.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) If, during a deal, any card be faced in the pack or
exposed, on, above, or below the table.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) If more than thirteen cards be dealt to any player.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) If the last card does not come in its regular order
to the dealer.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) If the dealer omit having the pack cut, deal out of
turn or with the adversaries’ cards, and either
adversary call attention to the fact before the
end of the deal and before looking at any of his
cards.</p>

</div>

<p>38. Should a correction of any offence mentioned in 37 <i>f</i>
not be made in time, or should an adversary who has looked at
any of his cards be the first to call attention to the error, the deal
stands, and the game proceeds as if the deal had been correct,
the player to the left dealing the next. When the deal has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
with the wrong cards, the next dealer may take whichever pack
he prefers.</p>

<p>39. If, prior to the cut for the following deal, a pack be
proved incorrect, the deal is void, but all prior scores stand.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The pack is not incorrect when a missing card or cards are
found in the other pack, among the quitted tricks, below the table,
or in any other place which makes it possible that such card or
cards were part of the pack during the deal.</p>

<p>40. Should three players have their proper number of cards,
the fourth, less, the missing card or cards, if found, belong to
him, and he, unless dummy, is answerable for any established
revoke or revokes he may have made just as if the missing card
or cards had been continuously in his hand. When a card is
missing, any player may search the other pack, the quitted tricks,
or elsewhere for it.</p>

<p>If before, during or at the conclusion of play, one player hold
more than the proper number of cards, and another less, the deal
is void.</p>

<p>41. A player may not cut, shuffle, or deal for his partner if
either adversary object.</p>

<h6>THE DECLARATION.</h6>

<p>42. The dealer, having examined his hand, must declare to
win at least one odd trick,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> either with a specified suit, or at
no trump.</p>

<p>43. After the dealer has declared, each player in turn, beginning
on the dealer’s left, must pass, make a higher declaration,
double the last declaration, or redouble a declaration which has
been doubled, subject to the provisions of Law 54.</p>

<p>44. A declaration of a greater number of tricks in a suit of
lower value, which equals the last declaration in value of points,
is a higher declaration; <i>e.g.</i>, a declaration of “three spades” is
higher than “one club.”</p>

<p>45. A player in his turn may overbid the previous adverse declaration
any number of times, and may also overbid his partner,
but he cannot overbid his own declaration which has been passed
by the three others.</p>

<p>46. The player who makes the final declaration<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> must play the
combined hands, his partner becoming dummy, unless the suit or
no trump finally declared was bid by the partner before it was
called by the final declarer, in which case the partner, no matter
what bids have intervened, must play the combined hands.</p>

<p>47. When the player of the two hands (hereinafter termed “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
declarer”) wins at least as many tricks as he declared, he scores
the full value of the tricks won (see Law 3).<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>47<i>a</i>. When the declarer fails to win as many tricks as he declares,
neither he nor his adversaries score anything toward
the game, but his adversaries score in their honour column 50
points for each under-trick (<i>i.e.</i>, each trick short of the number
declared). If the declaration be doubled, the adversaries score
100 points; if redoubled, 200 points for each under-trick.</p>

<p>48. The loss on the dealer’s original declaration of “one spade”
is limited to 100 points, whether doubled or not, unless redoubled.
Honours are scored as held.</p>

<p>49. If a player make a declaration (other than passing) out of
turn, either adversary may demand a new deal, or may allow
such declaration to stand, in which case the bidding shall continue
as if the declaration had been in turn.</p>

<p>If a player pass out of turn, the order of the bidding is not
affected, <i>i.e.</i>, it is still the turn of the player to the left of the
last declarer. The player who has passed out of turn may re-enter
the bidding in his proper turn if the declaration he has
passed be overbid or doubled.</p>

<p>50. If a player make an insufficient or impossible declaration,
either adversary may demand that it be penalized. The penalty
for an insufficient declaration is that the bid is made sufficient in
the declaration named and the partner of the declarer may not
further declare unless an adversary subsequently bid or double.
The penalty for an impossible declaration is that the bid is
made seven in the suit named and the partner of the declarer may
not further declare unless an adversary subsequently bid or
double. Either adversary, instead of penalizing an impossible
declaration, may demand a new deal, or that the last declaration
made on behalf of his partnership become the final declaration.</p>

<p>50<i>a</i>. If a player who has been debarred from bidding under
Laws 50 or 65, during the period of such prohibition, make any
declaration (other than passing), either adversary may decide
whether such declaration stand, and neither the offending player
nor his partner may further participate in the bidding even if
the adversaries double or declare.</p>

<p>50<i>b</i>. A penalty for a declaration out of turn (see Law 49),
an insufficient or impossible declaration (see Law 50), or a bid
when prohibited (see Law 50<i>a</i>) may not be enforced if either
adversary pass, double, or declare before the penalty be demanded.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>50<i>c</i>. Laws which give to either adversary the right to enforce
a penalty, do not permit unlimited consultation. Either adversary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
may call attention to the offence and select the penalty,
or may say, “Partner, you determine the penalty,” or words to
that effect. Any other consultation is prohibited,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and if it
take place, the right to demand any penalty is lost. The first
decision made by either adversary is final and cannot be
altered.</p>

<p>51. At any time during the declaration, a question asked by a
player concerning any previous bid must be answered, but, after
the final declaration has been accepted, if an adversary of the
declarer inform his partner regarding any previous declaration,
the declarer may call a lead from the adversary whose next
turn it is to lead. If the dummy give such information to the
declarer, either adversary of the declarer may call a lead. A
player, however, at any time may ask what declaration is being
played and the question must be answered.</p>

<p>52. A declaration legitimately made cannot be changed after
the next player pass, declare, or double. Prior to such action
a declaration inadvertently made may be corrected. If, prior to
such correction, an adversary call attention to an insufficient or
impossible declaration, it may not thereafter be corrected nor
may the penalty be avoided.</p>

<h6>DOUBLING AND REDOUBLING.</h6>

<p>53. Doubling and redoubling doubles and quadruples the value
of each trick over six, but it does not alter the value of a
declaration; <i>e.g.</i>, a declaration of “three clubs” is higher than
“two royal spades” doubled or redoubled.</p>

<p>54. Any declaration may be doubled and redoubled once, but
not more; a player may not double his partner’s declaration nor
redouble his partner’s double, but he may redouble a declaration
of his partner which has been doubled by an adversary.</p>

<p>The penalty for redoubling more than once is 100 points in
the adverse honour score or a new deal; for doubling a partner’s
declaration, or redoubling a partner’s double it is 50 points in
the adverse honour score. Either adversary may demand any
penalty enforceable under this law.</p>

<p>55. Doubling or redoubling reopens the bidding. When a
declaration has been doubled or redoubled, any one of the three
succeeding players, including the player whose declaration has
been doubled, may, in his proper turn, make a further declaration
of higher value.</p>

<p>56. When a player whose declaration has been doubled wins
the declared number of tricks, he scores a bonus of 50 points in
his honour score, and a further 50 points for each additional
trick. When he or his partner has redoubled, he scores 100<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
points for making the contract and an additional 100 for each
extra trick.</p>

<p>57. A double or redouble is a declaration, and a player who
doubles or redoubles out of turn is subject to the penalty provided
by Law 49.</p>

<p>58. After the final declaration has been accepted, the play
begins; the player on the left of the declarer leads.</p>

<h6>DUMMY.</h6>

<p>59. As soon as the player on the left of the declarer leads,
the declarer’s partner places his cards face upward on the table,
and the declarer plays the cards from that hand.</p>

<p>60. The partner of the declarer has all the rights of a player
(including the right to call attention to a lead from the wrong
hand), until his cards are placed face upward on the table.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> He
then becomes the dummy, and takes no part whatever in the
play, except that he has the right:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) To call the declarer’s attention to the fact that too
many or too few cards have been played to a trick;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) to correct an improper claim of either adversary;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) to call attention to a trick erroneously taken by either
side;</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) to participate in the discussion of any disputed question
of fact after it has arisen between the declarer
and either adversary;</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) to correct any erroneous score;</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) to consult with and advise the declarer as to which
penalty to exact for a revoke;</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) to ask the declarer whether he have any of a suit
he has renounced.</p>

</div>

<p>The dummy, if he have not intentionally looked at any card
in the hand of a player, has also the following additional rights:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>h</i>) To call the attention of the declarer to an established
adverse revoke;</p>

<p>(<i>i</i>) to call the attention of the declarer to a card exposed
by an adversary or to an adverse lead out of turn.</p>

</div>

<p>61. Should the dummy call attention to any other incident in
the play in consequence of which any penalty might have been
exacted, the declarer may not exact such penalty. Should the
dummy avail himself of rights (<i>h</i>) or (<i>i</i>), after intentionally
looking at a card in the hand of a player, the declarer may not
exact any penalty for the offence in question.</p>

<p>62. If the dummy, by touching a card or otherwise, suggest
the play of one of his cards, either adversary may require the
declarer to play or not to play such card.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>62<i>a</i>. If the dummy call to the attention of the declarer that he
is about to lead from the wrong hand, either adversary may require
that the lead be made from that hand.</p>

<p>63. Dummy is not subject to the revoke penalty; if he revoke
and the error be not discovered until the trick be turned and
quitted, whether by the rightful winners or not, the trick must
stand.</p>

<p>64. A card from the declarer’s hand is not played until actually
quitted, but should he name or touch a card in the dummy, such
card is played unless he say, “I arrange,” or words to that
effect. If he simultaneously touch two or more such cards, he
may elect which to play.</p>

<h6>CARDS EXPOSED BEFORE PLAY.</h6>

<p>65. After the deal and before the declaration has been finally
determined, if any player lead or expose a card, his partner may
not thereafter bid or double during that declaration,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and the
card is subject to call.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> When the partner of the offending
player is the original leader, the declarer may also prohibit the
initial lead of the suit of the exposed card.</p>

<p>66. After the final declaration has been accepted and before
the lead, if the partner of the proper leader expose or lead a
card, the declarer may treat it as exposed or may call a suit
from the proper leader. A card exposed by the leader, after
the final declaration and before the lead, is subject to call.</p>

<h6>CARDS EXPOSED DURING PLAY.</h6>

<p>67. After the original lead, all cards exposed by the declarer’s
adversaries are liable to be called and must be left face upward
on the table.</p>

<p>68. The following are exposed cards:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) Two or more cards played simultaneously;</p>

<p>(2) a card dropped face upward on the table, even though
snatched up so quickly that it cannot be named;</p>

<p>(3) a card so held by a player that his partner sees any
portion of its face;</p>

<p>(4) a card mentioned by either adversary as being held
in his or his partner’s hand.</p>

</div>

<p>69. A card dropped on the floor or elsewhere below the table,
or so held that it is seen by an adversary but not by the partner,
is not an exposed card.</p>

<p>70. Two or more cards played simultaneously by either of the
declarer’s adversaries give the declarer the right to call any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of such cards to the current trick and to treat the other card
or cards as exposed.</p>

<p>70<i>a</i>. Should an adversary of the declarer expose his last card
before his partner play to the twelfth trick, the two cards in his
partner’s hand become exposed, must be laid face upward on
the table, and are subject to call.</p>

<p>71. If, without waiting for his partner to play, either of the
declarer’s adversaries play or lead a winning card, as against
the declarer and dummy and continue (without waiting for his
partner to play) to lead several such cards, the declarer may demand
that the partner of the player in fault win, if he can, the
first or any other of these tricks. The other cards thus improperly
played are exposed.</p>

<p>72. If either or both of the declarer’s adversaries throw his or
their cards face upward on the table, such cards are exposed
and liable to be called; but if either adversary retain his hand,
he cannot be forced to abandon it. Cards exposed by the declarer
are not liable to be called. If the declarer say, “I have
the rest,” or any words indicating the remaining tricks or any
number thereof are his, he may be required to place his cards
face upward on the table. He is not then allowed to call any
cards his adversaries may have exposed, nor to take any finesse
not previously proved a winner unless he announce it when
making his claim.</p>

<p>73. If a player who has rendered himself liable to have the
highest or lowest of a suit called (Laws 80, 86, and 92) fail
to play as directed, or if, when called on to lead one suit, he
lead another, having in his hand one or more cards of the suit
demanded (Laws 66, 76, and 93), or if, when called upon to
win or lose a trick, he fail to do so when he can (Laws 71, 80,
and 92), or if, when called upon not to play a suit, he fail to
play as directed (Laws 65 and 66), he is liable to the penalty
for revoke (Law 84) unless such play be corrected before the
trick be turned and quitted.</p>

<p>74. A player cannot be compelled to play a card which would
oblige him to revoke.</p>

<p>75. The call of an exposed card may be repeated until it be
played.</p>

<h6>LEADS OUT OF TURN.</h6>

<p>76. If either adversary of the declarer’s lead out of turn, the
declarer may either treat the card so led as exposed or may call
a suit as soon as it is the turn of either adversary to lead.
Should they lead simultaneously, the lead from the proper hand
stands, and the other card is exposed.</p>

<p>77. If the declarer lead out of turn, either from his own hand
or dummy, he incurs no penalty, but he may not rectify the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
error unless directed to do so by an adversary.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> If the second
hand play, the lead is accepted.</p>

<p>78. If an adversary of the declarer lead out of turn, and the
declarer follow either from his own hand or dummy, the trick
stands. If the declarer before playing refuse to accept the lead,
the leader may be penalized as provided in Law 76.</p>

<p>79. If a player called on to lead a suit have none of it, the
penalty is paid.</p>

<h6>CARDS PLAYED IN ERROR.</h6>

<p>80. Should the fourth hand, not being dummy or declarer,
play before the second, the latter may be required to play his
highest or lowest card of the suit led, or to win or lose the
trick. In such case, if the second hand be void of the suit led,
the declarer in lieu of any other penalty may call upon the
second hand to play the highest card of any designated suit. If
he name a suit of which the second hand is void, the penalty is
paid.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>81. If any one, except dummy, omit playing to a trick, and
such error be not corrected until he has played to the next, the
adversaries or either of them may claim a new deal; should
either decide that the deal stand, the surplus card (at the end
of the hand) is considered played to the imperfect trick, but
does not constitute a revoke therein.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>82. When any one, except dummy, plays two or more cards to
the same trick and the mistake is not corrected, he is answerable
for any consequent revokes he may make. When the error is
detected during the play, the tricks may be counted face downward,
to see if any contain more than four cards; should this
be the case, the trick which contains a surplus card or cards
may be examined and such card or cards restored to the original
holder.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<h6>THE REVOKE.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></h6>

<p>83. A revoke occurs when a player, other than dummy, holding
one or more cards of the suit led, plays a card of a different
suit. It becomes an established revoke when the trick in which
it occurs is turned and quitted by the rightful winners (<i>i.e.</i>,
the hand removed from the trick after it has been turned face
downward on the table), or when either the revoking player or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
his partner, whether in turn or otherwise, leads or plays to the
following trick.</p>

<p>84. The penalty for each established revoke is:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) When the declarer revokes, he cannot score for tricks
and his adversaries add 100 points to their score in
the honour column, in addition to any penalty which
he may have incurred for not making good his
declaration.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) When either of the adversaries revokes, the declarer
may either add 100 points to his score in the honour
column or take three tricks from his opponents and
add them to his own.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Such tricks may assist the
declarer to make good his declaration, but shall not
entitle him to score any bonus in the honour column
in case the declaration has been doubled or redoubled,
nor to a slam or little slam not otherwise
obtained.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) When, during the play of a deal, more than one revoke
is made by the same side, the penalty for each
revoke after the first is 100 points.</p>

</div>

<p>The value of their honours is the only score that can be made
by a revoking side.</p>

<p>85. A player may ask his partner if he have a card of the
suit which he has renounced; should the question be asked before
the trick be turned and quitted, subsequent turning and quitting
does not establish a revoke, and the error may be corrected unless
the question be answered in the negative, or unless the revoking
player or his partner have led or played to the following
trick.</p>

<p>86. If a player correct his mistake in time to save a revoke,
any player or players who have followed him may withdraw his
or their cards and substitute others, and the cards so withdrawn
are not exposed. If the player in fault be one of the declarer’s
adversaries, the card played in error is exposed, and the declarer
may call it whenever he pleases, or he may require the
offender to play his highest or lowest card of the suit to the
trick, but this penalty cannot be exacted from the declarer.</p>

<p>87. At the end of the play the claimants of a revoke may search
all the tricks. If the cards have been mixed, the claim may be
urged and proved if possible; but no proof is necessary and the
claim is established if, after it is made, the accused player or his
partner mix the cards before they have been sufficiently examined
by the adversaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>88. A revoke cannot be claimed after the cards have been cut
for the following deal.</p>

<p>89. Should both sides revoke, the only score permitted is for
honours. In such case, if one side revoke more than once, the
penalty of 100 points for each extra revoke is scored by the other
side.</p>

<h6>GENERAL RULES.</h6>

<p>90. A trick turned and quitted may not be looked at (except
under Law 82) until the end of the play. The penalty for the
violation of this law is 25 points in the adverse honour score.</p>

<p>91. Any player during the play of a trick or after the four
cards are played, and before the trick is turned and quitted, may
demand that the cards be placed before their respective players.</p>

<p>92. When an adversary of the declarer, before his partner
plays, calls attention to the trick, either by saying it is his, or,
without being requested to do so, by naming his card or drawing
it toward him, the declarer may require such partner to
play his highest or lowest card of the suit led, or to win or lose
the trick.</p>

<p>93. An adversary of the declarer may call his partner’s attention
to the fact that he is about to play or lead out of turn;
but if, during the play, he make any unauthorized reference to
any incident of the play, the declarer may call a suit from the
adversary whose next turn it is to lead.</p>

<p>94. In all cases where a penalty has been incurred, the offender
is bound to give reasonable time for the decision of his adversaries.</p>

<h6>NEW CARDS.</h6>

<p>95. Unless a pack be imperfect, no player has the right to call
for one new pack. When fresh cards are demanded, two packs
must be furnished. When they are produced during a rubber,
the adversaries of the player demanding them have the choice of
the new cards. If it be the beginning of a new rubber, the dealer,
whether he or one of his adversaries call for the new cards, has
the choice. New cards cannot be substituted after the pack has
been cut for a new deal.</p>

<p>96. A card or cards torn or marked must be replaced by agreement
or new cards furnished.</p>

<h6>BYSTANDERS.</h6>

<p>97. While a bystander, by agreement among the players, may
decide any question, he should not say anything unless appealed
to; and if he make any remark which calls attention to an oversight
affecting the score, or to the exaction of a penalty, he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
liable to be called upon by the players to pay the stakes (not
extras) lost.</p>

<h5>ETIQUETTE OF AUCTION.</h5>

<p>In the game of Auction slight intimations convey much information.
The code succinctly states laws which fix penalties
for an offence. To offend against etiquette is far more serious
than to offend against a law; for in the latter case the offender
is subject to the prescribed penalties; in the former his adversaries
are without redress.</p>

<p>1. Declarations should be made in a simple manner, thus:
“one heart,” “one no trump,” “pass,” “double”; they should be
made orally and not by gesture.</p>

<p>2. Aside from his legitimate declaration, a player should not
show by word or gesture the nature of his hand, or his pleasure
or displeasure at a play, bid, or double.</p>

<p>3. If a player demand that the cards be placed, he should do
so for his own information and not to call his partner’s attention
to any card or play.</p>

<p>4. An opponent of the declarer should not lead until the preceding
trick has been turned and quitted; nor, after having led
a winning card, should he draw another from his hand before
his partner has played to the current trick.</p>

<p>5. A card should not be played with such emphasis as to draw
attention to it, nor should a player detach one card from his
hand and subsequently play another.</p>

<p>6. A player should not purposely incur a penalty because he
is willing to pay it, nor should he make a second revoke to conceal
a first.</p>

<p>7. Conversation during the play should be avoided, as it may
annoy players at the table or at other tables in the room.</p>

<p>8. The dummy should not leave his seat to watch his partner
play. He should not call attention to the score nor to any card
or cards that he or the other players hold.</p>

<p>9. If a player say, “I have the rest,” or any words indicating
that the remaining tricks, or any number thereof, are his, and
one or both of the other players expose his or their cards, or
request him to play out the hand, he should not allow any
information so obtained to influence his play.</p>

<p>10. If a player concede, in error, one or more tricks, the concession
should stand.</p>

<p>11. A player having been cut out of one table should not
seek admission in another unless willing to cut for the privilege
of entry.</p>

<p>12. A player should not look at any of his cards until the end
of the deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<h5>THE LAWS OF THREE HAND AUCTION.</h5>

<p>The Laws of Auction govern the three-hand game except as
follows:</p>

<p>(1) Three players take part in a game and four constitute a
complete table. Each plays for himself; there are no partners,
except as provided in Law 7.</p>

<p>(2) The player who cuts lowest selects his seat and the cards
with which he deals first. The player who cuts next lowest sits
on the dealer’s left.</p>

<p>(3) The cards are dealt in four packets, one for each of the
three players and one for the dummy.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The dummy hand is
not touched until after the final declaration has been made.</p>

<p>(4) The dealer declares, and the bidding continues as in Auction,
except that each player bids exclusively on his own account.</p>

<p>(5) The penalty for a declaration out of turn is that each of
the other players receives 50 points in his honour score. A
declaration out of turn does not affect the right of the player
whose turn it is to declare, unless both he and the other player,
either by passing or declaring, accept the improper declaration.</p>

<p>(6) If a player declare out of turn, and the succeeding player
either pass or declare, the third player may demand that the
mistake be corrected as is provided in Law 5. In such case the
player who first declared out of turn is the only one penalized.</p>

<p>(7) The player making the final declaration, <i>i.e.</i>, a declaration
that has been passed by both of the others, plays his own
hand and that of the dummy against the two others, who then,
and for that particular hand, assume the relationship of partners.</p>

<p>(8) It is advisable that the game be played at a round table
so that the hand of the dummy can be placed in front of the
declarer without obliging any player to move; but, in the event
of a square table being used, the two players who become the
adversaries of the declarer should sit opposite each other, the
dummy being opposite the declarer. At the end of the play the
original positions should be resumed.</p>

<p>(9) If, after the deal has been completed and before the conclusion
of the declaration, any player expose a card, each of his
adversaries counts 50 points in his honour score, and the declarer,
if he be not the offender, may call upon the player on his left
to lead or not to lead the suit of the exposed card. If a card
be exposed by the declarer after the final declaration, there is no
penalty, but if exposed by an adversary of the declarer, it is subject
to the same penalty as in Auction.</p>

<p>(10) If a player double out of turn, each of his adversaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
counts 100 points in his respective honour score, and the player
whose declaration has been doubled may elect whether the double
shall stand. The bidding is then resumed, but if the double shall
be disallowed, the declaration may not be doubled by the other
player.</p>

<p>(11) The rubber continues until two games have been won by
the same player; it may consist of two, three, or four games.</p>

<p>(12) When the declarer fulfils his contract, he scores as in
Auction. When he fails to do so, both of his adversaries score
as in Auction.</p>

<p>(13) Honours are scored by each player separately, <i>i.e.</i>, each
player who holds one honour scores the value of a trick; each
player who holds two honours scores twice the value of a trick;
a player who holds three honours scores three times the value of
a trick; a player who holds four honours scores eight times
the value of a trick; and a player who holds five honours
scores ten times the value of a trick. In a no-trump declaration,
each ace counts ten, and four held by one player count 100.
The declarer counts separately both his own honours and those
held by the dummy.</p>

<p>(14) A player scores 125 points for winning a game, a further
125 points for winning a second game, and 250 points for winning
a rubber.</p>

<p>(15) At the end of the rubber, all scores of each player are
added and his total obtained. Each one wins from or loses to
each other the difference between their respective totals. A player
may win from both the others, lose to one and win from the
other, or lose to both.</p>

<h5>THE LAWS OF DUPLICATE AUCTION.</h5>

<p>Duplicate Auction is governed by the Laws of Auction, except
in so far as they are modified by the following special laws:</p>

<p>A. <i>Scoring.</i> In Duplicate Auction there are neither games
nor rubbers. Each deal is scored just as in Auction, with the
addition that whenever a pair makes 30 or more for tricks as the
score of one deal, it adds as a premium 125 points in its honour
column.</p>

<p>B. <i>Irregularities in the Hands.</i> If a player have either more
or less than his correct number of cards, the course to be pursued
is determined by the time of the discovery of the irregularity.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) When the irregularity is discovered before or during
the original play: There must be a new deal.</p>

<p>(2) When the irregularity is discovered at the time the
cards are taken up for overplay and before such
overplay has begun: It must be sent back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
table from which it came, and the error be there
rectified.</p>

<p>(3) When the irregularity is not discovered until after
the overplay has begun: In two-table duplicate
there must be a new deal; but in a game in which
the same deals are played at more than two tables,
the hands must be rectified as is provided above and
then passed to the next table without overplay at
the table at which the error was discovered; in which
case, if a player have less than thirteen cards and
his adversary the corresponding surplus, each pair
takes the average score for that deal; if, however,
his partner have the corresponding surplus, his pair
is given the lowest score and his opponents the
highest score made at any table for that deal.</p>

</div>

<p>C. <i>Playing the cards.</i> Each player, when it is his turn to play,
must place his card, face upward, before him and toward the
centre of the table. He must allow it to remain upon the table
in this position until all have played to the trick, when he must
turn it over and place it face downward, nearer to himself; if
he or his partner have won the trick, the card should point toward
his partner and himself; otherwise it should point toward
the adversaries.</p>

<p>The declarer may either play dummy’s cards or may call
them by name whenever it is dummy’s turn to play and have
dummy play them for him.</p>

<p>A trick is turned and quitted when all four players have turned
and ceased to touch their respective cards.</p>

<p>The cards must be left in the order in which they were played
until the scores of the deal have been recorded.</p>

<p>D. <i>The Revoke.</i> A revoke may be claimed at any time before
the last trick of the deal in which it occurs has been turned
and quitted and the scores of that deal agreed upon and recorded,
but not thereafter.</p>

<p>E. <i>Error in Score.</i> A proved error in the trick or honour
score may be corrected at any time before the final score of the
contestants for the deal or deals played before changing opponents
has been made up and agreed upon.</p>

<p>F. <i>A New Deal.</i> A new deal is not allowed for any reason,
except as provided in Laws of Auction 36 and 37. If there be
an impossible declaration some other penalty must be selected.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
A declaration (other than passing) out of turn must stand;<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
as a penalty, the adversaries score 50 honour points in their honour
column and the partner of the offending player cannot thereafter
participate in the bidding of that deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The penalty for the offence mentioned in Law 81 is 50 points
in the adverse honour score.</p>

<p>G. <i>Team Matches.</i> A match consists of any agreed number
of deals, each of which is played once at each table.</p>

<p>The contesting teams must be of equal size, but each may consist
of any agreed number of pairs (not less than two). One
half of each team, or as near thereto as possible, sits north
and south; the other half east and west.</p>

<p>In case the teams are composed of an odd number of pairs,
each team, in making up its total score, adds, as though won by
it, the average score of all pairs seated in the positions opposite
to its odd pair.</p>

<p>In making up averages, fractions are disregarded and the
nearest whole numbers taken, unless it be necessary to take
the fraction into account to avoid a tie, in which case the match
is won “by the fraction of a point.” The team making the higher
score wins the match.</p>

<p>H. <i>Pair Contests.</i> The score of a pair is compared only with
other pairs who have played the same hands. A pair obtains a
plus score for the contest when its net total is more than the
average; a minus score for the contest when its net total is less
than the average.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Some players in America are adopting the English rule, which
allows the dealer to pass, without making any declaration. The usual expression
is, “No bid.” Each player to the left may then pass in turn, and
if no bid is made the deal passes to the left. The lowest declaration is
one club, as spades have a constant value of nine and are always “royals.”</p>

<p>The English rule is to score 50 for little slam and 100 for grand slam,
and some American players have adopted that rule.</p>

<h3>WHIST.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Whist is played with a full pack of fifty-two cards,
ranking A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2; the Ace being the
highest in play, but ranking below the deuce in cutting. Two
packs are generally used, the one being shuffled while the other is
dealt.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKERS</b></i> are necessary to keep the score. The most common
are red and white circular counters; the white being used
for the points in each game, and the red for the games themselves,
or for rubber points. It is better to have two sets, of different
colours, each set consisting of four circular and three oblong counters,
the latter being used for the rubber points, or for games.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Whist is played by four persons. When there
are more than four candidates for play, five or six may form a
“table.” If more than six offer for play, the selection of the table
is made by cutting.</p>

<p>The table being formed, the four persons who shall play the
first rubber are determined by cutting, and they again cut for
partners, and the choice of seats and cards.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> The methods of cutting are the same as those
described in connection with Bridge, and ties are decided in the
same manner.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS’ POSITIONS.</b></i> The four players at a whist
table are usually distinguished by the letters A, B, Y, Z; the first
two letters of the alphabet being partners against the last two, and
their positions at the table being indicated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p060.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Diagram of the position of the players at the table" />
</div>

<p>Z is always the dealer; A the original leader, or first hand; Y
the second hand; B the third hand; and Z the fourth hand.
After the first trick, some other player may become the leader; the
one on his left being the second hand; his partner the third hand,
and the player on his right the fourth hand. B is the pone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> The cards having been properly shuffled, the
dealer presents them to the <i><b>pone</b></i> to be cut. The American laws
require that after separating the pack, the pone shall place the cut
part, which he lifts off, nearer the dealer. Beginning at his left,
the dealer distributes the cards one at a time in rotation, until the
pack is exhausted. The last card is turned face up on the table,
and the suit to which it belongs is the trump for that hand.</p>

<p>When two packs are used, one is shuffled by the dealer’s partner
while the other is dealt, and the shuffled pack is placed on the left
of the player whose turn it will be to deal next. Each player deals
in turn until the conclusion of the game or rubber.</p>

<p><i><b>IRREGULARITIES IN THE DEAL.</b></i> The following
rules regarding the deal should be strictly observed:&mdash;</p>

<p>If any card is found faced in the pack, the dealer must deal
again. Should the dealer turn over any card but the trump, while
dealing, the adversaries may, if they please, demand a new deal.
A player dealing out of turn may be stopped before the trump
card is turned; but after that, the deal must stand, afterwards
passing to the left in regular order. On the completion of the
deal, each player should take up and count his cards to see that he
has thirteen; if not, it is a misdeal, and unless the pack is found
to be imperfect, the deal passes to the player on the misdealer’s
left. The dealer loses the deal:&mdash;if he neglects to have the pack
cut; if he deals a card incorrectly, and fails to remedy the error
before dealing another; if he counts the cards on the table, or
those remaining in the pack; if he looks at the trump card before
the deal is complete; or if he places the trump card face down, on
his own or on any other player’s cards.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> When stakes are played for, it should be distinctly
understood at the beginning whether the unit is for a game,
for a rubber, for rubber points, or for tricks. The English game
is invariably played for so much a rubber point; sometimes with
an extra stake upon the rubber itself. In America, it is usual
to play for so much a game; but in some cases the tricks are the
unit, deducting the loser’s score from seven, or playing the last
hand out and then deducting the loser’s score. A very popular
method is to play for a triple stake: so much a trick, playing each
hand out; so much a game; and so much a rubber. These three
stakes are usually in the proportion of 10, 25, and 50. In clubs it is
customary to have a uniform stake for whist, and to fix a limit
for all betting on the game beyond the “club stake.” Good usage
demands that those at the table should have the refusal of any
bet made by a player, before it is offered to an outsider.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The player on the dealer’s
left begins by leading any card he chooses, and the others must all
follow suit if they can. Failure to follow suit when able is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<i><b>revoking</b></i>; the penalty for which, under the American laws, is the
loss of two tricks; under the English laws, three tricks or points.
Any player having none of the suit led may either trump it or
throw away a card of another suit, which is called <i><b>discarding</b></i>.
When it is the dealer’s turn to play to the first trick, he should
take the trump card into his hand. After it has been taken up it
must not be named, and any player naming it is subject to a penalty,
(see Laws;) but a player may ask what the trump <i><b>suit</b></i>
is. If all follow suit, the highest card played wins the trick;
trumps win against all other suits, and a higher trump wins a
lower. The winner of the trick may lead any card he pleases
for the next trick, and so on until all thirteen tricks have been
played.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards Played in Error</b></i>, or dropped face upward on the
table, or two or more played at once, are called <i><b>exposed cards</b></i>,
and must be left on the table. They can be <i><b>called</b></i> by the adversaries;
but the fact of their being exposed does not prevent their
being played when the opportunity offers. Some persons imagine
that the adversaries can prevent an exposed card from being
played; but such is not the case.</p>

<p><i><b>Leading out of Turn.</b></i> Should a player lead out of turn, the
adversaries may call a suit from the player in error, or from his
partner, when it is next the turn of either of them to lead. American
laws require the call to be made by the player on the right of
the one from whom the suit is called. The English laws give the
adversaries the option of calling the card played in error an exposed
card. If all have played to the trick before discovering the
error, it cannot be rectified; but if all have not played, those who
have followed the false lead must take back their cards, which are
not, however, liable to be called.</p>

<p><i><b>Revoking Players</b></i> cannot win the game that hand, no matter
what they score; but they may play the hand out, and score all
points they make to within one point of game.</p>

<p>Any player may ask the others to <i><b>draw cards</b></i> in any trick,
provided he does so before they are touched for the purpose of
gathering them. In answer to this demand, each player should indicate
which of the cards on the table he played.</p>

<p>In the English game, any player may look at the last trick
turned and quitted; in the American he may not.</p>

<p><i><b>Taking Tricks.</b></i> As the tricks are taken, they should be
neatly laid one upon the other in such a manner that any player at
the table can count them at a glance. There are several methods
of stacking tricks; the first shown being probably the best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/p063.jpg" width="350" height="275" alt="Diagram of various methods of stacking tricks" />
</div>

<p>When six have been taken by one side they are usually gathered
together to form a <i><b>book</b></i>; any subsequently taken being laid apart,
as they are the only ones that count. It is customary for the
partner of the player winning the first trick on each side to gather
the tricks for that deal. In some places it is the custom for the
partner of the winner of each trick to gather it, so that at the end
of the hand each player has tricks in front of him. Although
this method saves time, the practice is not to be recommended, as
it hinders the players in counting the tricks already gained by
each side.</p>

<p>Immediately upon the completion of the play of a hand, the
score should be claimed and marked. Any discussion of the play
should be postponed until this has been attended to. The adversaries
must detect and claim revokes before the cards are cut for
the following deal.</p>

<p>The laws of whist should be carefully studied.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECT OF THE GAME.</b></i> The object of all whist play
is to take tricks, of which there are thirteen in each hand or deal.
The first six tricks taken by one side are called a <i><b>book</b></i>, and do
not count; but each trick above that number counts one point
towards game. The seventh trick is called the <i><b>odd</b></i>; and two or
more over the book are called <i><b>two</b></i>, <i><b>three</b></i>, etc., <i><b>by cards</b></i>. At
the conclusion of each hand, the side that has won any tricks in
excess of the book, scores them; the opponents counting nothing.
As soon as either side has scored the number of points previously
agreed upon as a game, which must be 5, 7, or 10, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
cards are again shuffled and spread for the choice of partners,
etc., unless it has been agreed to play a rubber.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> There are several methods of scoring at whist.
The English game is 5 points, rubbers being always played. Besides
the points scored for tricks, honours are counted; the games
have a different value, according to the score of the adversaries;
and the side winning the rubber adds two points to its score.</p>

<p>In scoring, the revoke penalty counts first, tricks next, and honours
last.</p>

<p><i><b>The Revoke.</b></i> Should the adversaries detect and claim a revoke
before the cards are cut for the following deal, they have the
option of three penalties: 1st. To take three tricks from the revoking
player, adding them to their own. 2nd. To deduct
three points from his game score. 3rd. To add three points to
their own game score. The penalty cannot be divided. A revoke
may be corrected by the player making it before the trick in which
it occurs has been turned and quitted. The card played in error
must be left face up on the table, and must be played when demanded
by the adversaries, unless it can be got rid of previously,
in the course of play. In America, the revoke penalty is two tricks.</p>

<p><i><b>The Honours</b></i> are the four highest trumps, A, K, Q, and J; and
<i><b>after tricks have been scored</b></i>, partners who held three honours
between them are entitled to count two points towards game;
four honours counting four points. If each side has two honours,
neither can count them. It is not enough to score them; after the
last card has been played, they must be claimed by word of mouth.
If they are not claimed before the trump is turned for the following
deal, they cannot be scored. Partners who, at the beginning of a
deal, are at the score of four, cannot count honours; they must get
the odd trick to win the game. Should one side be out by tricks,
and the other by honours, the tricks win the game, the honours
counting nothing.</p>

<p><i><b>Rubber Points.</b></i> At the conclusion of each game, the rubber
points are scored, either with the oblong counters, or on the small
keys of the whist-marker. If the winners of a game are five
points to their adversaries’ nothing, they win a <i><b>treble</b></i>, and count
three rubber points. If the adversaries have scored, but have one
or two points only, the winners mark two points, for a <i><b>double</b></i>.
If the adversaries have reached three or four, the winners mark
one, for a <i><b>single</b></i>. The rubber points having been marked, all
other scores are turned down. The side winning the rubber adds
two points to its score for so doing. The value of the rubber is
determined by deducting from the score of the winners any rubber
points that may have been made by their adversaries. The
smallest rubber possible to win is one point; the winners having
scored two singles and the rubber, equal to four; from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
they have to deduct a triple made by their adversaries. The
largest rubber possible is eight points, called a <i><b>bumper</b></i>, the
winners having scored two triples and the rubber, to their adversaries’
nothing.</p>

<p>It is sometimes important to observe the order of precedence
in scoring. For instance: if, at the beginning of a hand, A-B
have three points to Y-Z’s nothing, and A-B make two by honours,
Y-Z winning three by cards, Y-Z mark first; so that A-B win
only a <i><b>single</b></i>, instead of a <i><b>treble</b></i>. On the contrary, should A-B
make two by cards, Y-Z claiming four by honours, A-B win a
treble; as their tricks put them out before it is Y-Z’s turn to
count.</p>

<p>In America, where rubbers are played without counting honours,
it is not usual to reckon rubber points; but simply to add some
agreed value to the score of those winning the odd game.</p>

<p>Where single games are played, whether 5, 7, or 10 points, some
persons consider the game as finished when the agreed number of
points is reached. Others play the last hand out, and count all the
tricks made; so that if two partners were at the score of 6 in a
7-point game, and made five by cards, they would win a game of
11 points. When this is done, it is usual to deduct the score of the
losers from the total, and to call the remainder the value of the
game. In the American Whist League, the rule is to stop at
seven points, and to determine the value of the game by deducting
the loser’s score from seven.</p>

<p>When long sittings occur without change of partners or adversaries,
it is a common practice to count the tricks continuously,
and on the conclusion of the play, to deduct the lower score from
the higher, the winners being credited with the difference.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING OUT.</b></i> If rubbers are played, there is no change
of partners, or of rotation in the deal, until one side has won two
games, which ends the rubber. If the first two games are won by
the same partners, the third is not played. If more than four
players belong to the table, those who have just played cut to decide
which shall give place to those waiting; those cutting the
highest cards going out. If six belong to the table, there will be
no further cutting out; as those who are out for one rubber re-enter
for the next, taking the places of those who have played two
consecutive rubbers. If five belong to the table, the three who
remained in for the second rubber must cut to allow the fifth
player to re-enter. At the end of the third rubber, the two cut
that have not yet been out; and at the end of the fourth rubber,
the one who has played every rubber goes out without cutting.
After this, it is usual to spread the cards, and to form the table
anew. In all the foregoing instances, partners and deal must be
cut for, after the cut has decided which are to play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>MARKING.</b></i> There are various methods of using the
counters. At the beginning of the game they may be placed at the
left hand, and transferred to the right as the points accrue. Another
method is to stack the four circular counters one upon the other
at the beginning of the game, and to count a point by placing one
of them beside the others; two points by placing another upon
the first; three points by placing a third beyond these two, and
four points by placing them all in line.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p066a.jpg" width="500" height="50" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Nothing. <span class="spacer">One.</span> <span class="spacer">Two.</span> <span class="spacer">Three.</span> Four.</p>
</div>

<p>In the seven point game, the score is continued by placing one
counter above, and to the right or left of the other three, to indicate
five points; and above and between them to indicate six.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="spacer">Five.</span> <span class="spacer">Or this.</span> <span class="spacer">Six.</span></p>
</div>

<p>When counters are not used, one of the standard forms of
whist-marker is employed, the most legible and convenient being

always level with the surface and can be seen equally well from
any position at the table.</p>

<p>The four large keys on one side are used to count single points,
the single large key on the opposite side being reckoned as five.
The three small keys are used for counting rubber points, or games.</p>

<p>In ten point games, the scoring to four points is the same; but
beyond four, a single counter placed <i><b>below</b></i> two or more others, is
reckoned as three; and <i><b>above</b></i> two or more others, as five.</p>

<p>Whatever the apparatus employed, it should be such that every
player at the table can distinctly see the state of the score without
drawing attention to it.</p>

<p><i><b>METHODS OF CHEATING.</b></i> Whist offers very few
opportunities to the card-sharper. When honours are counted, he
may be able to keep one on the bottom of the pack until the completion
of the deal by <i><b>making the pass</b></i> after the cards have
been cut. A <i><b>greek</b></i> who possessed sufficient skill to do this without
detection would be very foolish to waste his talents at the
whist table; for, however large the stakes, the percentage in his
favour would be very small.</p>

<p>When whist is played with only one pack, a very skillful shuffler
may gather the cards without disturbing the tricks, and, by giving
them a single <i><b>intricate</b></i> shuffle, then drawing the middle of the
pack from between the ends and giving another single intricate
shuffle, he may occasionally succeed in dealing himself and his
partner a very strong hand in trumps, no matter how the cards are
cut, so that they are not shuffled again. A hand dealt in this
manner is framed on the walls of the Columbus, Ohio, Whist Club;
eleven trumps having been dealt to the partner, and the twelfth
turned up. In this case the shuffling dexterity was the result of
fifteen years’ practice, and was employed simply for amusement,
the dealer never betting on any game, and making no concealment
of his methods.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> Although whist
is a game of very simple construction, the immense variety of
combinations which it affords renders it very complicated in
actual practice; there being probably no game in which there is so
much diversity of opinion as to the best play, even with the same
cards, and under similar conditions. It has been repeatedly remarked
that in all the published hands at whist which have been
played in duplicate, or even four times over, with the same cards,
no two have been alike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be useless to formulate rules intended to cover every
case that might arise, because the conditions are frequently too
complicated to allow the average human intellect to select the exact
rule which would apply. All that can be done to assist the beginner
is to state certain general principles which are well recognised
as fundamental, and to leave the rest to experience and practice at
the whist table.</p>

<p><i><b>GENERAL PRINCIPLES.</b></i> Nothing obstructs the
progress of the beginner so much as his attempts to cover all the
ground at once. The more ambitious he is, the greater his necessity
for keeping in view the maxim; “One thing at a time: all
things in succession.” One must master the scales before he can
produce the perfect melody.</p>

<p>The novice should first thoroughly understand the object, and
the fundamental principle of the game.</p>

<p><i><b>The Object</b></i> is to win tricks. Not to give information, or to
count the hands, or to remember every card played; but simply
and only to win tricks.</p>

<p><i><b>The Principle</b></i> is to secure for certain cards a trick-taking
value which does not naturally belong to them; either by
getting higher cards out of the way of lower, or by placing the
holder of intermediate cards at a disadvantage with regard to the
lead.</p>

<p>If any person will take the trouble to deal out four hands,
and after turning them face up on the table, count how many tricks
each side will probably take with its high cards and trumps, he
will find that the total will hardly ever be exactly thirteen tricks.
Let us suppose the following to be one of the hands so dealt; Z
turning up the ♡6 for trumps:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p068.jpg" width="400" height="235" alt="Diagram of the table, players and hands" />
</div>

<p>On looking over this hand it would appear that A could only
make one trick in Clubs, of which the second round would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
trumped. His partner can count on five tricks: the two best and
the fourth trumps; the ♢A, and the ♠K; a total of six tricks.
On counting the adversaries’ probable tricks, Y should make one
of his three trumps, and the ♠A. Diamonds will not go round
twice without being trumped, so we cannot count on his ♢K.
We cannot see any sure tricks for Z. Where are the five other
tricks necessary to bring our total up to thirteen? They must be
there, for there are thirteen tricks taken in every hand played.</p>

<p>If we play over the hand, we shall find that A-B may make
six, seven, nine, or ten tricks, according to their good management,
and the good or bad play of their adversaries. In <i><b>Foster’s
Whist Tactics</b></i>, Illustrative Hand No. 13, may be found the
various ideas of sixteen of the best players in the American Whist
League with regard to the proper management of this hand.
They played it in four different ways, and with very different
results in the score.</p>

<p>This must show that the accidental distribution of the Aces,
Kings, and trumps is not everything in whist, and that there must
be ways and means of securing tricks which do not appear on the
surface.</p>

<p>There are four ways of taking tricks at whist:</p>

<p>1st. By playing high cards, the suit of which the others must
follow. This A does, in the example, on the first round of the
Club suit.</p>

<p>2nd. By playing low cards, after the higher ones have been
exhausted, and the adverse trumps are out of the way. This Y
will do with his Diamonds, or A with his Clubs, according to circumstances.</p>

<p>3rd. By trumping winning cards played by the adversaries.
This Y will do if Clubs are led a second time, or A will do if
Diamonds are led twice.</p>

<p>4th. By being able to take tricks with cards which are not the
best of the suit, the player who holds better cards having already
played smaller. This B will do with the ♡10 if A leads trumps,
and Y does not play either Q or J. If B leads trumps he will lose
this advantage.</p>

<p>These four methods of winning tricks suggest four systems of
play, which are those in common use by experts at the present
day:</p>

<p>1st. Playing high cards to the best advantage, so as to secure
the best results from such combinations as may be held. This is
the basis of all <i><b>systems of leading</b></i>.</p>

<p>2nd. Leading from the longest suit, in order that higher cards
may be forced out of the way of smaller ones, leaving the smaller
ones “established,” or good for tricks after the adverse trumps
are exhausted. This is called the <i><b>long-suit game</b></i>.</p>

<p>3rd. Trumping good cards played by the adversaries. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
called <i><b>ruffing</b></i>. When two partners each trump a different suit,
it is called a <i><b>cross-ruff</b></i>, or <i><b>saw</b></i>.</p>

<p>4th. Taking advantage of the <i><b>tenace</b></i> possibilities of the hand
by placing the lead with a certain player; or by avoiding the
necessity of leading away from tenace suits. For example: A
player holds A Q 10 of a suit, his right hand adversary holding K
J 9. These are known as the <i><b>major</b></i> and <i><b>minor</b></i> tenaces.
Whichever leads makes only one trick; but if the holder of the
major tenace can get the suit led twice, he makes all. This is
called the <i><b>short-suit game</b></i>, or <i><b>finesse and tenace</b></i>. Its resources
may be added to by finessing against certain cards. For
example: Holding A Q 3 of a suit led by the partner, to play Q
is a finesse against fourth hand having the King.</p>

<p>Each of these systems has its advantages, and almost every
hand will offer opportunities for practice in all of them.</p>

<p>The most important thing to impress on the beginner is that
whist cannot be played by machinery. Some authorities would
have us believe that certain theories alone are sound; that certain
systems of play alone are good; and that if one will persevere in
following certain precepts, in such matters as leading, management
of trumps, etc., that the result will be more than average success
at the whist table.</p>

<p>Nothing can be further from the truth. As in all other matters
largely controlled by chance, there is no system, as a system, which
will win at whist. One cannot succeed by slavish adherence to
either the long or the short-suit game; by the invariable giving of
information, or the continual playing of false cards. The true elements
of success in whist lie in the happy combination of all the
resources of long and short suits, of finesse and tenace, of candour
and deception, continually adjusted to varying circumstances, so
as to result in the adversaries’ losing tricks.</p>

<p><i><b>HOW TO STUDY WHIST.</b></i> Any person, anxious to become
an expert whist player, may attain to considerable proficiency
in a short time, if he will content himself with mastering the following
general principles one at a time; putting each into practice
at the whist table before proceeding to the next.</p>

<p>The science of modern whist may be divided into two parts:
1st. <i><b>Tactics</b></i>; or the purely conventional rules for leading, second
and third hand play, returning partner’s suits, etc., all of
which may be learnt from books, or gathered from more experienced
players. 2nd. <i><b>Strategy</b></i>; or the advantageous use of the
information given by the conventional plays. This is largely dependent
on personal ability to judge the situation correctly, and to
select the methods of play best adapted to it.</p>

<p><i><b>CONVENTIONAL PLAYS.</b></i> These may be divided into
two parts: those used by the partners who attack, either with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
their strong suits, or by leading out trumps; and those employed
by their adversaries, who are defending themselves against such
suits, or wishing to prevent their trumps being drawn. We shall
first consider the conventionalities used in attack.</p>

<p><i><b>Leading.</b></i> The player with the original lead should have a
double object in view; to secure the best results for his own hand,
and to indicate to his partner where he is in need of assistance.</p>

<p>The first matter for his consideration will be whether to begin
with a trump or with a plain suit. There are two principal uses for
trumps. The most attractive to the beginner is that of ruffing the
adversaries’ winning cards; and the most important to the expert
is leading trumps to prevent this. No matter how strong or well
established a plain suit may be, it is of uncertain value as long as
the adversaries have any trumps with which to stop it. A suit is
established when you can probably take every trick in it. If a
player with a good established suit is sufficiently strong to make
it probable that he can, with his partner’s assistance, exhaust the
adverse trumps, he should do so by leading trumps. If they are
probably stronger than he, he must <i><b>force</b></i> them, by leading the established
suit which they will be compelled to trump, weakening
their hands and gradually reducing their trump strength until it is
possible to exhaust what remains by leading. It being to the advantage
of the player with a good suit to exhaust the trumps, it
must be desirable to his adversaries to keep theirs, if possible, for
the purpose of ruffing this good suit.</p>

<p>Trumps are also useful as cards of re-entry, when a player has
an established suit, but has not the lead; their most important use,
however, is in defending or stopping established suits.</p>

<p><i><b>Rules for Leading Trumps.</b></i> With five or more trumps,
the beginner should always begin by leading them, regardless of
the rest of his hand. With three or less he should never lead
them, unless he has very strong cards in <i><b>all</b></i> the plain suits. With
four trumps exactly, he should lead them if he has an established
suit and a card of re-entry in another suit. A card of re-entry in
plain suits is one which is pretty sure to win a trick, such as an
Ace, or a guarded King. The following are examples of hands
from which trumps should be led originally by a beginner;&mdash;</p>

<p>Hearts are trumps in every case.</p>

<table summary="Cards">
  <tr>
    <td>♡ J 8 6 4 2;</td>

    <td>♢ 3;</td>
    <td>♠ A 7.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The following are examples of hands from which trumps should
not be led:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Cards">
  <tr>
    <td>♡ A K Q;</td>
    <td>♣ J 8 7 5 3;</td>
    <td>♢ Q 4;</td>
    <td>♠ K 4 2.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>♡ Q J 10 2;</td>
    <td>♣ 5 2;</td>
    <td>♢ A K Q 2;</td>
    <td>♠ 6 4 3.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>♡ A Q 5 4;</td>
    <td>♣ K Q J 6 3;</td>
    <td>♢ A 9 2;</td>
    <td>♠ K.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>If at any later stage of the hand, a player finds himself with an
established suit and a card of re-entry, he should lead trumps if he
has four. For instance: The player with the last example should
lead trumps if the first round of Clubs either forced the Ace out of
his way, or found it with his partner.</p>

<p><i><b>Rules for Leading Plain Suits.</b></i> It is safest for the beginner
to select his longest suit for the original lead; unless he has
a four-card suit which is much stronger. Length and high cards,
the two elements of strength, are often very nearly balanced. In
the following examples the player should begin with the longest
suit:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Cards">
  <tr>
    <td>♡ A 4 3;</td>
    <td>♣ J 10 9 8 3;</td>
    <td>♢ A K Q;</td>
    <td>♠ K 2.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>♡ K 10 8 3;</td>
    <td>♣ 4 2;</td>
    <td>♢ K Q 10 8 2;</td>
    <td>♠ A Q.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In the following the four-card suit should be selected:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Cards">
  <tr>
    <td>♡ J 3;</td>
    <td>♣ 6 5 4 3 2;</td>
    <td>♢ J 10 5 3;</td>
    <td>♠ Q 8.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>♡ Q 4 2;</td>
    <td>♣ 7;</td>
    <td>♢ 10 6 4 3 2;</td>
    <td>♠ A K Q 10.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The principle which should guide in the selection of a plain suit for
the original lead is, that if there are a number of small cards in
one suit, and a few high cards in another, by leading the long
suit first, the higher cards in it are forced out of the way, and the
high cards in the shorter suit will then bring the holder of the
established small cards into the lead again. But if the high cards
of the short suit are first led, the long suit of small cards is dead.</p>

<p>Having determined whether to lead the trump or the plain
suit, the next point is to select the proper card of the suit to lead.
At first the beginner need not trouble himself about making any
distinction between trumps and plain suits; that will come later.</p>

<p><i><b>Rules for Leading High Cards.</b></i> Having a strong suit,
but without cards of re-entry or trump strength to support it, the
best policy is to make tricks while you can. With such a suit as
A K Q 2, no one need be told not to begin with the deuce.
Whenever a player holds two or more of the best cards of a suit
he should play one of them. If he holds both second and third
best, playing one of them will force the best out of his way, leaving
him with the commanding card.</p>

<p>The cards which are recognised by whist players as high, are
the A K Q J 10, and if we separate the various combinations from
which a player should lead each of them, a study of the groups
so formed will greatly facilitate our recollection of them.</p>

<p>In the first group are those containing two or more of the best
cards. In this and all following notation, the exact size of any
card below a Ten is immaterial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p073a.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="🂡 🂮 🂭 🂫 | 🂱 🂾 🂻 🂷 | 🃁 🃎 🃍 🃆 | 🃑 🃞 🃔 🃓" />
</div>

<p>So far as trick-taking is concerned, it is of no importance which
of the winning cards is first led; but for the past hundred years
it has been the custom for good whist players to lead the <i><b>King</b></i>
from all these combinations, in order that the partner may be informed,
by its winning, that the leader holds the Ace also.</p>

<p>In the second group are those containing both the second and
third best, but not the best.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p073b.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="🂮 🂭 🂫 🂪 | 🂾 🂽 🂺 🂸 | 🃎 🃍 🃋 🃄 | 🃞 🃝 🃗 🃖" />
</div>

<p>The <i><b>King</b></i> is the proper lead from these combinations. If it
wins, the partner should have the Ace; if it loses, partner should
know the leader holds at least the Queen.</p>

<p>Both these groups, which contain all the King leads, may be
easily remembered by observing that the King is always led if
accompanied by the Ace or Queen, or both. Beginners should
follow this rule for leading the King, regardless of the number
of small cards in the suit, unless they hold the sequence of K Q
J, and at least two other cards.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 525px;">
<img src="images/p073c.jpg" width="525" height="75" alt="🂮 🂭 🂫 🂪 🂤 | 🃎 🃍 🃋 🃄 🃃" />
</div>

<p>From this combination the <i><b>Jack</b></i> is the usual lead, in order to
invite partner to put on the Ace, if he has it, and get out of the
way, thus establishing the suit in the leader’s hand. This is the
only high-card combination from which the Jack is led.</p>

<p>There is only one combination from which the <i><b>Queen</b></i> is led,
regardless of the number of the small cards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/p074a.jpg" width="310" height="75" alt="🂭 🂫 🂪 🂦 🂥" />
</div>

<p>This may be remembered by observing that there is no higher
card in the suit than the one led, and that it contains a sequence
of three cards, Q J 10. This lead is an indication to the partner
that the leader holds neither Ace nor King.</p>

<p>There is only one combination from which the <i><b>Ten</b></i> is led, regardless
of the number of small cards.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 235px;">
<img src="images/p074b.jpg" width="235" height="75" alt="🂾 🂻 🂺 🂵" />
</div>

<p>The Ten led is an indication to partner that both Ace and
Queen are against the leader.</p>

<p>Combinations from which the <i><b>Ace</b></i> is led contain at least five
cards in suit, or both Queen and Jack.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p074c.jpg" width="500" height="75" alt="🂱 🂷 🂶 🂴 🂲 | 🃑 🃝 🃛 🃖" />
</div>

<p>This lead is an indication to partner that the leader has not the
King, and that the suit is either long, or contains three honours.</p>

<p><i><b>Rules for Leading Low Cards.</b></i> If the suit selected for the
lead contains none of the combinations from which a high card
should be led, it is customary with good players to begin with the
4th-best, counting from the top of the suit. This is called the
card of uniformity; because it indicates to the partner that there
are remaining in the leader’s hand exactly three cards higher than
the one led. From any of the following combinations the proper
lead would be the Four:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p074d.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="🃞 🃛 🃘 🃔 🃓 | 🃑 🃝 🃚 🃔 | 🂽 🂻 🂶 🂴 🂲 | 🂱 🂻 🂺 🂴" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p075a.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="🂫 🂪 🂩 🂤 🂢 | 🂮 🂨 🂧 🂤 | 🃊 🃉 🃈 🃄 🃃 | 🃍 🃆 🃅 🃄" />
</div>

<p><i><b>Rules for Leading Short Suits.</b></i> It will sometimes happen
that the only four-card suit in the leader’s hand will be trumps,
which it is not desirable to lead. In such cases, if there is no
high-card combination in any of the short suits, it is usual to lead
the highest card, unless it is an Ace or King. Many good players
will not lead the Queen from a three card suit, unless it is accompanied
by the Jack. All such leads are called <i><b>forced</b></i>, and
are intended to assist the partner, by playing cards which may
strengthen him, although of no use to the leader. The best card
should be led from any such combinations as the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 465px;">
<img src="images/p075b.jpg" width="465" height="225" alt="🃝 🃛 🃖 | 🃊 🃉 🃄 | 🃋 🃊 🃅 | 🃙 🃘 🃔 | 🂫 🂥 🂣 | 🂷 🂶 🂴" />
</div>

<p>All these rules for leading apply equally to any position at the
table when a player opens his own suit for the first time.</p>

<p><i><b>Rules for Leading Second Round.</b></i> On the second round
of any suit, the player holding the best card should play it; or
having several equally the best, one of them. If he is Fourth
Hand, he may be able to win the trick more cheaply.</p>

<p>If the original leader has several cards, equally the best, such
as A Q J remaining after having led the King, he should continue
with the lowest card that will win the trick. This should be an
indication to his partner that the card led is as good as the best,
and that therefore the leader must have the intermediate cards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Following King</b></i>, which has been led from these combinations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p076a.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="🂡 🂮 🂭 🂫 | 🂱 🂾 🂻 🂷 | 🃁 🃎 🃍 🃆 | 🃑 🃞 🃔 🃓" />
</div>

<p>Leading the Jack on the second round would show both Ace
and Queen remaining. Leading Queen would show Ace, but not
the Jack. Leading Ace would show that the leader had not the
Queen.</p>

<p>In combinations which do not contain the best card, the lead
may be varied in some cases to show the number remaining in
the leader’s hand, or to indicate cards not shown by the first lead.</p>

<p><i><b>Following King</b></i>, which has been led from these combinations:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Leading the Ten on the second round would show both Queen
and Jack remaining. Leading the Jack would show the Queen;
but not the ten.</p>

<p><i><b>Following the Jack</b></i>, led from this combination:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;">

</div>

<p>Leading King on the second round would show five cards in the
suit originally. Leading the Queen would show more than five.</p>

<p><i><b>Following the Queen</b></i>, led from this combination:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/p076d.jpg" width="340" height="75" alt="🃍 🃋 🃊 🃄 🃃" />
</div>

<p>Leading Jack on the second round shows the suit to have originally
contained only four cards; the Ten would show more than
four.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Following the Ace</b></i>, led from these combinations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p077a.jpg" width="500" height="75" alt="🃑 🃝 🃛 🃖 | 🂡 🂭 🂫 🂦 🂥" />
</div>

<p>Leading the Queen shows the suit was short. Leading the Jack
shows that it contained at least five cards.</p>

<p>When a player holds both the second and third-best of a suit
on the second round, he should always play one of them, whether
he is First, Second, or Third Hand. This protects him, by forcing
the command of the suit, if it does not win the trick. Having
led the Ten from K J 10 x, if the Ace or Queen wins the first
trick, the K should be next led. Having led the Four from Q
J 6 4 2, if Ace or King falls to the first trick, the Queen should be
led. If the Jack, Queen, and Ace fall to the first trick, a player
holding both Ten and Nine should lead the Ten.</p>

<p>After leading high cards from some combinations, and winning
the trick, they may no longer contain either the best or the second
and third best. Such are the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p077b.jpg" width="500" height="225" alt="🂡 🂭 🂧 🂤 🂢 | 🂾 🂽 🂺 🂴 | 🃁 🃋 🃉 🃄 🃃 | 🂮 🂭 🂧 🂤 | 🃑 🃙 🃘 🃔 🃓 | 🃎 🃋 🃊 🃄" />
</div>

<p>The rule in all such cases is to follow with the card of uniformity,
the original fourth-best.</p>

<p>If the combinations are those from which the fourth-best had
been led originally, and the leader has neither the best, nor both
second and third best to go on with, he should continue with the
lowest card in his hand, unless he had six or more in suit; in
which case he may go on with the remaining fourth-best.</p>

<p><i><b>AVOID CHANGING SUITS.</b></i> A player having once
begun with a suit, either for the purpose of establishing it, or of
taking tricks in it, should not change it until he is forced to do so.
Running off to untried suits is one of the beginner’s worst faults.
There are five good reasons for changing suits, and unless one of
them can be applied, the suit should be continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>1st. In order to lead trumps to defend it.</p>

<p>2nd. In order to avoid forcing partner.</p>

<p>3rd. In order to avoid forcing both adversaries.</p>

<p>4th. Because it is hopeless, and there is some chance in another.</p>

<p>5th. To prevent a cross ruff, by leading trumps.</p>

<p><i><b>Simple Inferences</b></i> from the fall of the cards usually supply
the best guide in the matter of changing suits.</p>

<p>If the Jack is led from K Q J x x, and wins the trick, partner
may be credited with the Ace; and if the original leader has four
trumps, and a card of re-entry, he should quit his established suit,
and lead trumps to defend it.</p>

<p>If the King and Ace have been led from A K x x, partner
dropping the Queen on the second round, the suit should be
changed, unless the original leader is strong enough to risk weakening
his partner by forcing him to trump the third round. Four
trumps are generally considered to be sufficiently strong to justify
a force in this position. Some players will force, even with a weak
hand, if the two cards played by the partner are small, and he has
not availed himself of an artifice known as <i><b>calling for trumps</b></i>,
which we shall consider presently.</p>

<p>If the King and Ten have been led from K Q J 10, and on the
second round one adversary has dropped the Eight, the other the
Nine; the suit should be changed, as partner must have the Ace,
and neither of the adversaries have any more. To lead such a
suit again is called <i><b>forcing both adversaries</b></i>; as it allows
one to make a small trump and the other to get rid of a losing
card.</p>

<p>If the Four has been led from J 8 6 4, and the adversaries have
won the first trick with the Nine or Ten, A K Q must be against
the leader and his partner, and the suit should be abandoned as
hopeless, unless it is feasible to force the partner.</p>

<p>If at any time there is a strong indication that the adversaries
will have a cross-ruff, it is usually best to stop leading plain suits,
and attempt to get out the trumps.</p>

<p><i><b>THE LEADER’S PARTNER</b></i>, or the Third Hand, has
several conventional plays to remember; the most important of
which are the following:</p>

<p><i><b>When Partner Leads High Cards</b></i>, the Third Hand has
usually little to do but to play his lowest of the suit. The exceptions
are:</p>

<p>If he holds A J alone, on a King led, the Ace should be played.</p>

<p>If he holds A Q alone on a Ten led, the Ace should be played.
With A Q x, the Ten should be passed. With Ace and small
cards, the Ace should be played on the Ten. With Queen and
small cards the Ten should be passed. When Third Hand plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Queen on a Ten led, it should be a certainty that he has no more
of the suit.</p>

<p>If he holds A K and only one small card, the King should be
played on a Queen led.</p>

<p>If he holds Ace and only one small card, the Ace should be
played on the Jack led. If Third Hand has four trumps and a
card of re-entry, the Ace should be played on Jack led, regardless
of number, in older to lead trumps at once, to defend the suit.</p>

<p><i><b>When Partner Leads Low Cards</b></i>, the Third Hand should
do his best to secure the trick. If he has several cards of equal
trick-taking value, such as A K Q, or K Q J, he should win the
trick as cheaply as possible. The only <i><b>finesse</b></i> permitted to the
Third Hand in his partner’s suit, is the play of the Queen, when he
holds A Q and others; the odds being against Fourth Hand having
the King.</p>

<p><i><b>Foster’s Eleven Rule.</b></i> By deducting from eleven the number
of pips on any low card led, the Third Hand may ascertain
how far his partner’s suit is from being established. For instance:
if the card led is the Seven, Second Hand playing the Eight, and
Third Hand holding A J 6 3, from which he plays Ace, Fourth
Hand playing the Five; the only card against the leader must be
the King or Queen; he cannot have both, or he would have led
one. If the Second Hand has not the missing card, he has no more
of the suit. The number of inferences which may be made in
this manner by observant players is astonishing. A great many
examples and exercises in them are given in <i><b>Foster’s Whist
Manual</b></i>.</p>

<p><i><b>Third Hand having None of the Suit</b></i>, should trump
anything but an Ace or a King on the first round. On the second
round, if there is only one card against the leader, his partner
should pass with four trumps, and allow the suit to be established.
For instance: If the leads have been Ace, then Jack, Third Hand
holding only one of the suit; he should pass if the Second Hand
does not play King.</p>

<p><i><b>Third Hand on Strengthening Cards.</b></i> Unless Third
Hand has both Ace and King of the suit, he should pass any
forced or strengthening lead which is not covered by the Second
Hand. This obliges the Fourth Hand to open another suit, or to
continue at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>Third Hand winning first round has the choice of four lines of
play:</p>

<p>1st. To lead trumps, if he is strong enough.</p>

<p>2nd. To return the best card of his partner’s suit if he has it.
This is imperative before opening any other suit but trumps.</p>

<p>3rd. To lead his own suit, if he can do anything with it. It is
considered better play for the Third Hand to return the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
leader’s suit than to open a long weak suit of his own such as one
headed by a single honour.</p>

<p>4th. To return his partner’s suit even with a losing card, in
preference to changing.</p>

<p>When the original lead is a trump, it should be returned in
every case, either immediately, or as soon as the player can obtain
the lead.</p>

<p>The same reasons for changing suits as those given for the
original leader will apply to the Third Hand.</p>

<p><i><b>RULES FOR RETURNING PARTNER’S SUITS.</b></i>
When the original leader’s suit is returned by his partner, either
immediately or upon his regaining the lead, it is usual to show, if
possible, how many cards remain in the Third Hand, so that by
adding them to his own, the leader may estimate the number held
by his adversaries. This consideration is secondary to the return
of the best, or one of the second and third best; but in the absence
of such cards, the Third Hand should always return the higher of
only two remaining, and the lowest of three or more, regardless of
their value.</p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing conventionalities, which are proper
to the leader of a suit and his partner, there are two usages which
apply equally to any player at the table. These are discarding
and forcing.</p>

<p><i><b>Discarding.</b></i> When a player cannot follow suit, and does not
wish to trump, his safest play is to discard whatever seems of
least use to him. It is not considered good play to unguard a
King or to leave an Ace alone; but this may be done if the partner
is leading trumps, and there is a good established suit to
keep. Beginners should be careful to preserve cards of re-entry,
even if they have to discard from their good suit in order to do
so.</p>

<p>When the adversaries have shown strength in trumps, or are
leading them, there is little use in keeping a long suit together.
It is much better to keep guard on the suits in which they are
probably strong, letting your own and your partner’s go.</p>

<p>A player having full command of a suit, may show it to his
partner by discarding the best card of it. Discarding the second-best
is an indication that the player has not the best; and in
general, the discard of any small card shows weakness in that
suit.</p>

<p><i><b>Forcing.</b></i> We have already observed that a player who is
weak himself should not force his partner. An exception may be
made in cases where he has shown weakness, or has had a chance
to lead trumps and has not done so. On the contrary, an adversary
should not be forced unless he has shown strength, or the
player forcing him is weak. The hope of a player with a good
suit is to defend it by leading and exhausting the trumps. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
adversary tries to keep his trumps in order to stop that suit; at
the same time forcing the strong hand, by leading cards which he
must trump, hoping that such a force may so weaken him that he
will be unable to continue the trump lead.</p>

<p>It is usually very difficult to convince the beginner that the
weaker he is himself, the more reason he has for forcing the
adversaries to trump his good cards. He is constantly falling into
the error of changing from a good suit, which the adversaries cannot
stop without trumping, to a weak suit, which allows them to
get into the lead without any waste of trump strength. If an
adversary refuses to trump a suit, it is imperative to keep on with
it until he does; for it is always good play to force an adversary
to do what he does not wish to do.</p>

<p>Any person may convince himself of the soundness of this
theory of forcing, by giving himself the six highest cards in any
suit, three small cards in the others, and four trumps; giving
another player the four best trumps, and nine of the highest cards
in two suits. If the first player forces the second with his good
suit, and continues every time he gets the lead, he must win six
tricks; if he does not, the second player makes a slam.</p>

<p>A deliberate force from a partner should always be accepted,
if he is a good player.</p>

<p>We may now turn our attention to the conventionalities used by
players who are opposed to the establishment of suits in the hands
of the leader and his partner. These are divided between the
Second and the Fourth Hand, the former being the more important.
Generally speaking, they are the tactics of defence.</p>

<p><i><b>SECOND HAND PLAY.</b></i> The player who is second to
play on any trick is called the Second Hand. It is his duty to protect
himself and his partner, as far as possible, in the adversaries’
strong suits. The chief point for the beginner to observe in Second
Hand play, is the difference between the circumstances requiring
him to play high cards, and those in which he should play low
ones.</p>

<p><i><b>High Cards Led.</b></i> When a card higher than a Ten is led on
the first round of a suit, the Second Hand has usually nothing to
do but to play his lowest card, and make what inference he can as
to the probable distribution of the suit. But if he holds the Ace,
or cards in sequence with it, such A K, he should cover any
card higher than a Ten. If he holds K Q he should cover a J, 10,
or 9 led; but it is useless for him to cover an honour with a single
honour, unless it is the Ace.</p>

<p><i><b>Low Cards Led.</b></i> High cards are played by the Second Hand
when he has any combination from which he would have led a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
high one if he had opened the suit. The fact that a player on his
right has already laid a small card of the suit on the table should
not prevent the Second Hand from making the best use of any
combinations he may hold. The only difference between leading
from such combinations, and playing them Second Hand, is that in
the latter case no attempt is made to indicate to the partner the
exact nature of the combination held. The general rule is to win
the trick as cheaply as possible, by playing the lowest of the high
cards which form the combination from which a high card would
be led. Such are the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p082a.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="🂡 🂮 🂭 🂫 | 🂾 🂽 🂻 🂸 | 🂱 🂾 🂽 🂳 | 🃞 🃝 🃘 🃔 | 🃑 🃞 🃕 🃒 | 🃎 🃋 🃊 🃅 | 🃁 🃍 🃋 🃂 | 🂭 🂫 🂪 🂣" />
</div>

<p>The beginner must be careful with these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p082b.jpg" width="500" height="75" alt="🂡 🂮 🂫 🂢 | 🃎 🃍 🃊 🃆" />
</div>

<p>The combination which makes the first of these a high-card
lead is the A K, and the King must be played Second Hand. The
Jack has nothing to do with it. In the second, the Ten does not
form any part of the combination, and the Queen is the card to
play Second Hand. Some players will not play a high card second
hand with K Q x x unless weak in trumps.</p>

<p>An exception is generally made with these combinations, from
which the proper lead is the Ace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p082c.jpg" width="500" height="75" alt="🃑 🃝 🃘 🃔 🃓 | 🂡 🂩 🂨 🂧 🂤" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Many will not play Ace Second Hand in any case, and will
play the Queen with the first combination only when they are
weak in trumps. The reason for this exception is the importance
of retaining command of the adverse suit as long as possible.</p>

<p><i><b>On the Second Round</b></i>, the Second Hand should follow the
usual rule for playing the best of the suit if he holds it; or one of
the second and third best, if he holds them. He should also be careful
to estimate, by the eleven rule, how many cards are out against
the leader, which will sometimes guide him to a good finesse. For
instance: first player leads Ace, then Eight. If the Second Hand
holds K J 9 2, instead of playing the best card to the second
round, which would be King, he should finesse the Nine.</p>

<p><i><b>With Short Suits.</b></i> When Second Hand holds such short-suit
combinations as:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/p083.jpg" width="450" height="75" alt="🂽 🂻 🂷 | 🂻 🂺 🂵" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">and a small card is led, his proper play is one of the high cards,
because he cannot save both of them.</p>

<p><i><b>On Strengthening Cards Led.</b></i> This is a difficult point for
the beginner, and his best plan is to follow the rules already given
for covering cards higher than the Ten. One of the most common
errors is to cover a Jack led with a Queen, when holding A Q and
others. The Ace should be put on invariably. To play the Queen
in such a position is called <i><b>finessing against yourself</b></i>.</p>

<p><i><b>Singly Guarded Honours.</b></i> Many players put on the King
Second Hand, if they hold only one small card with it, and a
small card is led. This will win the trick as often as it will lose it;
but it betrays the hand to the adversary, and enables him to finesse
deeply if the suit is returned. It may be done in order to get the
lead, and in trumps the practice is very common, and generally
right. With Queen and only one small card, it can be demonstrated
that it is useless to play the Queen Second Hand, except
as an experiment, or to get the lead in desperate cases.</p>

<p>With any combination weaker than J 10 x, it is useless to attempt
to win the trick Second Hand, and only makes it difficult
for the partner to place the cards correctly.</p>

<p><i><b>The Fourchette.</b></i> When the Second Hand has cards immediately
above and below the one led, he should cover. The beginner
may have some difficulty in recognising the fact that he
holds fourchette if the suit has been round once or twice, and the
intermediate cards have been played. Such cards as a Queen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
a Seven may be fourchette over a Nine, if Jack, Ten and Eight
have been played.</p>

<p><i><b>Second Hand Having None</b></i> of the suit led, on either first
or second round, must decide whether or not to trump it. If the
card led is the best of the suit, he should certainly do so; but if it
is not, and there is any uncertainty as to who will win the trick, it
is usual for the Second Hand to pass when he has four trumps.
With five trumps, there should be some good reason for keeping
the trumps together, as a player with so many can usually afford
to trump. If he does not trump, his play comes under the rules
for discarding.</p>

<p><i><b>FOURTH-HAND PLAY.</b></i> The Fourth Hand is the last
player in any trick. He is the partner of the Second Hand, but
has not so many opportunities for the exercise of judgment, his
duties being simply to win tricks if he can, and as cheaply as
possible. If he cannot win the trick, he should play his lowest
card.</p>

<p>A bad habit of Fourth-Hand players is holding up the tenace A
J when a King or Queen is led originally. This is called the
<i><b>Bath Coup</b></i>, and the suit must go round three times for it to
succeed in making two tricks. The holder of the tenace should
equally make two tricks by playing the Ace at once, provided he
does not lead the suit back.</p>

<p><i><b>The Turn-up Trump.</b></i> When trumps are led by the adversaries,
it is a common practice to play the turn-up as soon as possible,
unless it is a valuable card. On the contrary, it is usual to
keep it as long as possible when the partner leads trumps.</p>

<p><i><b>Changing Suits.</b></i> If the Second or Fourth Hand wins the
first or second round of the adversaries’ suit, it is seldom right to
return it, as that would probably be playing their game. The
player should open his own suit, as if he were the original leader.
If he is strong enough to lead trumps under ordinary circumstances,
he may be deterred from so doing if the adversaries have
declared a strong suit against him. The same consideration may
prevent his leading trumps in the hope of making a suit of his
own, as the adversaries might reap the benefit by bringing in their
suit instead. On the contrary, when the Second or Fourth Hand
holds command of the adverse suit, they may often risk a trump
lead which would otherwise be injudicious. Having once started
a suit, it should not be changed, except for one of the reasons
already given for the guidance of the First Hand.</p>

<p><i><b>When the Adversaries Lead Trumps</b></i>, and the Second
Hand has a chance either to establish a suit against them or to
force his partner, he should stop the trump lead if he can. If his
partner has led trumps, the Second Hand should generally play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
his winning cards on his right hand opponent’s plain-suit leads, to
stop them; and continue the trumps.</p>

<p>These are about all the conventionalities necessary for the
beginner. After at least a year’s practice with them, he will either
discover that he has no aptitude for the game, or will be ready to
go into further details. A beginner who attempts to handle the
weapons of the expert simply plays with edged tools, which will
probably cut no one but himself and his partner.</p>

<p class="tb"><i><b>THE SIGNAL GAME.</b></i> Having become thoroughly familiar
with the elementary conventionalities of the game, so that they
can be used without the slightest hesitation at the whist table, the
player may proceed to acquaint himself with the details of what is
commonly known as the Signal Game, which comprises all the
various methods of signalling up hands between partners, according
to certain arbitrary and pre-arranged systems of play. Many
players object to these methods as unfair; but they are now too
deeply rooted to yield to protest; and the best thing for a player to
do is to familiarise himself with his adversaries’ weapons.</p>

<p><i><b>The Trump Signal.</b></i> A player anxious to have trumps led,
but who has no immediate prospect of the lead, may call on his
partner to lead trumps at the first opportunity, by playing any two
cards of a suit led, the higher before the lower. Let us suppose
him to hold five good trumps, with the Six and Two of a suit of
which his partner leads King, then Jack. By playing first the
Six, and then the Two, he calls upon his partner to quit the suit,
and lead a trump.</p>

<p>Among some players, the lead of a strengthening card when an
honour is turned, is a call for trumps to be led through that honour
at the first opportunity, but it is not good play.</p>

<p>Passing a certain winning card is regarded by most players as
an imperative call for trumps.</p>

<p>The discard of any card higher than a Seven is known as a
single-card-call. Even if it was not so intended, it is assumed that
a trump lead cannot injure a player with nothing smaller than a
Nine in his hand.</p>

<p><i><b>Answering Trump Signals.</b></i> In response to partner’s call,
a player should lead the best trump if he holds it; one of the
second and third best if he holds them; the highest of three or
less; the lowest of four; and the fourth-best of more than four.
Holding any of the regular high-card combinations in trumps, he
should lead them in the regular way in answer to a call.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>After a Force.</b></i> If the player is forced before he can answer
the call, he may indicate the number of trumps originally held by
playing them in this manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>With 3 or less; trumping with the lowest; leading the highest.</p>

<p>With 4 exactly; trumping with the 3rd-best; leading the highest.</p>

<p>With 5 or more; trumping with the 3rd-best; leading the 4th-best.</p>

<p>These methods of taking the force must not be carried to extremes.
For instance: A player holding K J 10 2, would hardly
be justified in trumping with the 10 to show number. Some
experts, holding the best trump with at least four others, will not
lead it; preferring to show number first, by leading the fourth-best.
Others, holding four, lead the lowest after trumping with
the third-best.</p>

<p><i><b>The Echo in Trumps.</b></i> When the partner leads high
trumps, the Third Hand should echo with four or more, by signalling
in the trump suit. The universal form of the echo is to play
first the third-best, then the fourth-best. When a player has
called, and his partner leads, it is unnecessary for the caller to
echo. Players seldom echo on adverse trump leads, even with five
trumps.</p>

<p><i><b>The Four-Signal.</b></i> There are several ways of showing four
or more trumps without asking partner to lead them. Among
some players the original lead of a strengthening card is an evidence
of four trumps, and is called an <i><b>Albany Lead</b></i>. A player
holding three cards of any plain suit, such as the 3, 4, 5, may show

<p>The second of these is the four-signal; the last three are trump
signals. They are used only in following suit.</p>

<p>The four-signal is sometimes used in the trump suit as a <i><b>Sub-echo</b></i>,
to show three trumps exactly.</p>

<p>Apart from signalling, trump strength may often be inferred,
especially from player’s passing doubtful tricks, forcing their partners,
etc.</p>

<p><i><b>Trump Suit Leads.</b></i> When trumps are not led for the purpose
of exhausting them immediately, but simply as the longest
suit, the fourth-best may be led from the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p087a.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="🂱 🂾 🂷 🂶 🂴 | 🃎 🃍 🃆 🃅 | 🂡 🂨 🂧 🂤 🂢 | 🃞 🃛 🃚 🃖" />
</div>

<p>If the Ten accompanies the King and Queen, in the third combination,
it is best to adhere to the usual lead of the King.</p>

<p>In leading trumps from combinations containing a winning
sequence, such as the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p087b.jpg" width="500" height="75" alt="🂱 🂾 🂽 🂻 🂷 | 🃁 🃎 🃍 🃄 🃃" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">many players begin with the lowest of the winning cards, continuing
with the next above it.</p>

<p><i><b>Speculative Trump Leads.</b></i> The whist player will often find
himself with a single good suit, a card of re-entry, and few trumps.
Certain conditions of the score may prompt him to make a speculative
trump lead from such a hand. If his trumps are high, such
as A K x, he may safely begin by leading them; but if they are
weak, and he is depending largely on his partner’s possible
strength, he should show his suit first by leading it once.</p>

<p><i><b>Over-trumping</b></i> is generally regarded as bad policy when a
player has a good suit, and sufficient trump strength to justify him
in hoping to do something with it. The refusal to over-trump,
unless the trump played is a high one, should be regarded by the
partner as a call.</p>

<p>It is sometimes necessary to over-trump partner in order to get
the lead. For instance: A player holds the two best trumps, and
all winning cards of a plain suit, while the player on his right has
a losing trump. In such a position the player with the two best
trumps should trump any winning card his partner leads, or over
trump him if he trumps, so as to prevent the adversary from making
that losing trump.</p>

<p><i><b>Under-trumping, or the Grand Coup</b></i>, is playing a low
trump on a trick that partner has already trumped with a higher,
in order to avoid the lead. For instance: A player holds major
tenace in trumps with a small one, and knows that the minor
tenace is on his right. Four cards remain in each hand. The
player on the left leads; Second Hand trumps; Third Hand follows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
suit. If the Fourth Hand keeps his three trumps, he must
win the next trick, and lose the advantage of his tenace.</p>

<p>A player will sometimes have the best card in two suits, and a small
trump, and will know that the two best trumps and an unknown
card are on his right. If the missing suit is led, and the player on
the right trumps, his unknown card must be one of the two other
suits, and the player with the command of them should keep both,
and throw away his small trump. The discards on the next trick
may enable him to determine the suit of the losing card on his
right.</p>

<p><i><b>The Last Trump.</b></i> If two players have an equal number of
trumps, each of them having an established suit, it will be the object
of both to remain with the last trump, which must bring in
the suit. The tactics of each will be to win the third round of
trumps; and then, if the best trump is against him, to force it out
with the established suit, coming into the lead again with the last
trump. So often is it important to win the third round of trumps
that few good players will win the second round, unless they can
win the third also. With an established suit, a card of re-entry,
and four trumps King high, a player should lead trumps; but if
his partner wins the first round and returns a small trump, the
King should not be put on, no matter what Second Hand plays,
unless the card next below the King is fourchette. Some of the
most brilliant endings in whist are skirmishes for the possession of
the last trump; the player who is at a disadvantage often persistently
refuses the fatal force, hoping the leader will be compelled
to change his suit, or will lose the lead.</p>

<p><i><b>Drawing the Losing Trump.</b></i> It is usually best to draw
losing trumps from the adversaries, unless a player can foresee
that he may want the best to stop a strong adverse suit.</p>

<p><i><b>A Thirteenth Card</b></i>, played by the partner, is usually considered
an invitation to put on the best trump. The Second Hand should
not trump a thirteenth card unless he is weak in trumps.</p>

<p><i><b>AMERICAN LEADS.</b></i> Advanced players, who have had so
much practice that they can infer the probable position of the
cards without devoting their entire attention to it, have adopted a
new system of leading from the four combinations following, in
order to show the number of small cards in the suit:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p088.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="🃑 🃞 🃝 🃛 🃖 | 🂱 🂾 🂶 🂴 🂲 | 🃁 🃎 🃍 🃆 🃅 | 🂮 🂭 🂧 🂤 🂢" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>From these the King is never led if there are more than four
cards in the suit. Having more than four, the lowest of the sequence
of high cards is led. From the first this would be the
Jack; from the second the Queen; from the third the Ace, (because
the King is barred;) and from the fourth the Queen. The
Ten is not ranked among the high cards in American Leads.</p>

<p>On the second round, with the first two combinations, the difference
between a suit of five or one of six cards may be indicated
by following with the Ace if five were held originally; the King,
if more than five. Seven cards may be shown with the first combination,
by leading the Queen on the second round.</p>

<p>The chief difference these leads make in the play of the Third
Hand is that he should not trump any court card led, even if weak
in trumps. The misunderstanding as to the meaning of the first
lead, especially if it is a Queen, often occasions confusion and loss;
but this is claimed to be offset by the value of the information
given. Some lead 10 from Q J 10; 4th-best from K J 10.</p>

<p>To the adversaries these leads are often of value, as they are
frequently enabled to place the cards very accurately from the information
given by the lead itself, regardless of the fall of the cards
from the other hands. For instance: Second Hand holds A J of a
suit in which King is led; Third Hand plays the Four; Fourth Hand
plays the Nine. The leader remains with Q 3 2; Third Hand still
has 8 7 6 5; and if he has also the 10, Fourth Hand has no more.
Again: The leader shows a suit of six; Second Hand holding
two only. If the suit is led a third time it is a doubtful trick, and
with four trumps the Second Hand should pass. If the leader
shows the exact number of the suit originally led, and then changes
to a four-card suit, the adversaries know at least nine of his cards.</p>

<p>So obvious is this that it is an almost invariable rule for a player,
on quitting his suit, to conceal the length of the second suit led by
leading the highest card of a short suit.</p>

<p>If it were allowable to exercise some judgment in using these
leads, they might not be open to so many objections; but they are
worse than useless unless the partner can depend on their being
uniformly adopted.</p>

<p><i><b>The Minneapolis Lead.</b></i> This is another variation in the
leads, which is confined to one combination; that of Ace and any
four other cards, not including the King. With strength in trumps
the fourth-best is led instead of the Ace, the theory being that the
Ace is more likely to be valuable on the second or third round of
such a suit than on the first, and that the trump strength justifies
the finesse of the original lead. With weak trumps the Ace is led.
Some players extend this principle to the Second Hand, and play
Ace on a small card led, when holding A x x x x with weak
trumps. This is open to the objection that it gives up command
of the adverse suit too early in the hand; but it saves many a trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>The Plain-suit Echo.</b></i> This is another device for giving information
as to number. When the original leader begins with a
high card, the Third Hand should play his third-best if he holds
four or more; and on the second round his second best, always retaining
his fourth-best and any below it. The value of this echo
is much disputed, and the adversaries can usually render it ineffective
by holding up small cards; a practice very much in vogue
with advanced players.</p>

<p><i><b>Low’s Signal.</b></i> This is the latest system of indicating to the
leader the number of cards in his suit held by the Third Hand.
With four or more of the suit, the third-best is played to the lead
of a high card, or when no attempt is made to win the trick. In
retaining the suit, the second-best is led if three or more remain,
and on the third round, or in a discard, the highest is played,
always retaining the fourth-best and those below it. For instance:
With the 8 7 5 2 of a suit which partner leads, the 5 is
played to the first round. If the suit is returned, the 7 is played;
and next time the 8. Holding only three originally, the lowest is
played to the first round, and the higher of two returned, in the
usual way. The chief value of this signal is that the return of the
lowest of a suit shows absolutely no more, instead of leaving the
original leader in doubt as to whether it is the only one, or the lowest
of three remaining. It is also a great exposer of false cards.</p>

<p><i><b>Discard Signalling</b></i> is another method of indicating plain
suits. When a player is known to have no trumps, and therefore
cannot be calling for them, he may use the trump signal
in any plain suit which he wishes led to him. As a general rule,
a player should not use this signal unless he has a certain trick in
the suit in which he signals. Some players use what is called the
reverse discard; a signal in one suit meaning weakness in it, and
an invitation to lead another. This avoids the necessity for using
the good suit for signalling purposes.</p>

<p><i><b>Unblocking.</b></i> When the original leader shows a suit of five
cards, and the Third Hand has four exactly, the latter should
keep his lowest card, not for the purpose of echoing, but in order
to retain a small card which will not block the holder of the
longer suit. If the Third Hand has three cards of the suit led,
and among them a card which may block his partner, he should
give it up on the second round. For instance: Holding K 4 3,
and partner showing a five-card suit by leading Ace then Jack,
Third Hand should give up the King on the second round.
Again: Holding Q 9 3, partner leading Ace then Eight; Second
Hand playing King second round, Third Hand should give up the
Queen. Again: Holding K Q, partner leading the 8 originally,
won by Fourth Hand with Ace; the King should be discarded or
otherwise got rid of at the first opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Short-suit Leads.</b></i> Many players will not lead a long weak
suit unless they have sufficient strength to justify them in hoping
to establish, defend, and bring it in, with <i><b>reasonable</b></i> support
from the partner. With a long suit, headed by a single honour,
weak trumps, and no cards of re-entry, they prefer selecting a
strengthening card for the original lead, hoping it may be of some
assistance to partner by affording a successful finesse. It is
claimed that it is better for a person, especially with a strong
hand, to play with the knowledge that his partner is weak, than
under the impression that he may be strong. Such an opening
lead should warn the Third Hand to finesse deeply, to hold any
tenaces he may have, and to let nothing pass him which might be
too much for his weak partner to attend to. This is a very
difficult game to play well, and is seldom resorted to except by the
most expert.</p>

<p><i><b>Deschapelles Coups.</b></i> It often happens that after the adverse
trumps are exhausted, a player will find himself with the lead,
but unable to give his partner a card of his established suit. In
such cases the best course is to sacrifice the King or Queen of
any suit of which he has not the Ace, in the hope that it may
force the best of the suit, and leave partner with a card of re-entry.
For instance: The leader has established the Club suit;
his partner has exhausted the trumps, Hearts; and having no
Clubs, leads the King of Spades from K x x x. If the holder of
the Club suit has Spade Queen, and the King forces the Ace, the
Club suit will be brought in. If he has not the Queen, the Clubs
are probably hopeless. The <i><b>coup</b></i> risks a trick to gain several.</p>

<p>Players should be careful not to fall into this trap in the end-game;
and it is generally right to hold up the Ace if the circumstances
are at all suspicious.</p>

<p><i><b>Tenace Positions.</b></i> Many expert players will not lead away
from a suit in which they hold tenace. Having two suits, one
containing a tenace, and the other without it, they will select the
latter, although it may be much weaker. It is noteworthy that
players who disregard the value of holding a tenace in the opening
lead, are well aware of its importance toward the end of the
hand. When one player holds tenace over another, the end
game often becomes a struggle to place the lead; and players
frequently refuse to win tricks in order to avoid leading away
from tenaces, or to compel another player to lead up to them.</p>

<p><i><b>Underplay</b></i> is often resorted to by the Fourth Hand in suits
in which the Third Hand has shown weakness. For instance:
A small card is led; Third Hand playing the Ten, and Fourth
Hand holding A Q J x. It is a common artifice to win with the
Queen, and return the small card. When the original leader is underplayed
in his own suit, he should invariably put up his best card.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Finessing.</b></i> The expert may finesse much more freely than
the beginner. Having led from such a suit as K J x x and partner
having won with Ace and returned a small card, the Jack may be
finessed with strong trumps. If the adversaries lead trumps, and
the Ace wins the first round, a player holding the King second
hand on the return, may finesse by holding it up, trusting his
partner for the trick.</p>

<p>In all cases that mark the best of the suit against a player, and
on his left, he may finesse against the third best being there also.
For instance: A player leads from K 10 x x x. Third Hand
plays Queen and returns a small card. The Ten should be finessed,
regardless of trump strength, as the Ace must be on the left, and
the finesse is against the Jack being there also. Many varieties
of this finesse occur.</p>

<p><i><b>Placing the Lead.</b></i> This is usually a feature of the end-game
A player may have an established suit, his adversary being
the only person with any small cards of it. If the lead can be
placed in the hand of this adversary, he must eventually lead the
losing cards.</p>

<p>A player begins with a weak suit of four cards, on the first
round of which it is evident that his partner has no more, the adversaries
having all the high cards. The suit is not played again,
and for the last six tricks the original leader finds himself with
three cards of it, and the Q x x of another suit. If the adversaries
play King and Ace of the latter suit, the Queen should be given
up, trusting partner for the Jack, for the Queen will force the holder
of the three losing cards into the lead. It is sometimes necessary
to throw away an Ace in order to avoid the lead at critical stages
of the end-game.</p>

<p><i><b>False Cards.</b></i> It requires more than ordinary skill to judge
when a false card will do less harm to the partner than to the
adversaries. There are some occasions for false-card play about
which there is little question. Having a sequence in the adverse
suit, the Second or Fourth Hand may win with the highest card,
especially if the intention is to lead trumps. Holding K Q only,
Second Hand may play the King, especially in trumps. Holding
A K x, the Fourth Hand should play Ace on a Queen led by an
American leader. With such a suit as K J 10 x, after trumps
have been exhausted, the Ten is not a safe lead; Jack or fourth-best
is better. Holding up the small cards of adverse suits is a
common stratagem; and it is legitimate to use any system of
false-carding in trumps if it will prevent the adversaries who have
led them from counting them accurately.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing to the Score.</b></i> The play must often be varied on
account of the state of the score, either to save or win the game in
the hand. If the adversaries appear to be very strong, and likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to go out on the deal, all conventionalities should be disregarded
until the game is saved; finesses should be refused, and winning
cards played Second Hand on the first round. If the adversaries
are exhausting the trumps, it will often be judicious for a player
to make what winning cards he has, regardless of all rules for
leading, especially if they are sufficient to save the game.</p>

<p>It often happens that the same cards must be played in different
ways according to the state of the score, and the number of tricks
in front of the player. A simple example will best explain this.
Hearts are trumps; you hold two small ones, two better being
out against you, but whether in one hand or not you cannot tell.
You have also two winning Spades, one smaller being still out.
The game is seven-point whist. The importance of playing to
the score will be evident if you consider your play in each of the
following instances, your score being given first:</p>

<ul>
<li>Score 6 to 6; you have 5 tricks in front of you.</li>
<li>Score 6 to 6; you have 4 tricks in front of you.</li>
<li>Score 6 to 5; you have 4 tricks in front of you.</li>
<li>Score 5 to 4; you have 5 tricks in front of you.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><b>INFERENCES.</b></i> The great strength of the expert lies in his
ability to draw correct inferences from the fall of the cards, and
to adapt his play to the circumstances.</p>

<p>Inferences from the various systems of leads and returns are too
obvious to require further notice; but attention may be called to
some that are often overlooked, even by advanced players:</p>

<p>If a suit led is won by Third Hand with King or Ace; and the
original leader wins the second round with King or Ace, the adversaries
must have the Queen.</p>

<p>If the Third Hand plays Ace first round, he has neither King
nor Queen. If he plays Queen on a Ten led, he has no more. If
he plays Ace on a King led, he has the Jack alone, or no more.</p>

<p>If the Second Hand plays King first round on a small card led,
he has Ace also, or no more. If he plays Ace under the same conditions,
he has no more. [See Minneapolis Lead.]</p>

<p>If a suit is led, and neither Third nor Fourth Hand has a card in
it above a Nine, the original leader must have A Q 10, and the
second player K J. When neither Third nor Fourth Hand holds
a card above the Ten, the major and minor tenaces are divided
between the leader and the Second Hand. If it can be inferred
that the leader held five cards in the suit originally, he holds the
minor tenace.</p>

<p>When a player, not an American leader, begins with a Jack
and wins the trick, the adversaries may conclude that his partner
had two small cards with the Ace, and had not four trumps and
another winning card.</p>

<p>When a good player changes his suit, he knows that it will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
go round again, or that the command is against him. This is
often a valuable hint to the adversaries. When he quits his original
suit and leads trumps, without his partner having called, the
adversaries may conclude that the suit has been established.</p>

<p>When a player puts Ace on his partner’s Jack led, and does not
lead trumps, the adversaries may count on him for only one small
card of the suit led.</p>

<p>When an adversary finesses freely, he may be credited with
some strength in trumps.</p>

<p>When a player changes his suit, the adversaries should note
carefully the fall of the cards in the new suit. As already observed,
the leader almost invariably opens the new suit with the
best he has. Suppose a player to lead two winning cards in one
suit, and then the Eight of another, which the Second Hand wins
with the Ten; The four honours in the second suit must be between
the Second and Fourth Hands.</p>

<p>Having won the first or second round of the adverse suit, and
having no good suit of his own, the Second or Fourth Hand may
be able to infer a good suit with his partner, by the play. For instance:
A player opens Clubs, showing five, his partner wins
second round, and opens the Diamond suit with the Jack, on
which Second Hand plays Ace, his partner dropping the 9. Having
now the lead, and no good suit, it is evident that the play
should be continued on the assumption that partner is all Spades
and trumps.</p>

<p class="tb"><i><b>THE AMERICAN GAME.</b></i> Since the revolt against the
invariable opening from the longest suit, which was the style of
game advocated by the old school of Pole and “Cavendish,” many
systems have been tried out by the various clubs that meet at our
national tournaments. E.C. Howell was the first to attempt to
set the short-suit game in order, but his methods have long since
been superseded by more elastic tactics.</p>

<p>The fundamental principle of the short-suit game, as first explained
to the world by the New York <i>Sun</i>, is to use the original
or opening lead to indicate the general character of the hand rather
than any details of the individual suit. In the long-suit game the
original leader is always assuming that his partner may have something
or other, and playing on that supposition. The short-suit
player indicates the system of play best adapted to his own hand,
without the slightest regard to the possibilities of his partner. It
is the duty of the partner to indicate his hand in turn, and to shape
the policy of the play on the combined indications of the two.</p>

<p>This does not mean that the player shall always lead a short
suit, but that he should combine the best features of both systems,
without slavish adherence to either. This idea has been brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to perfection in practice by the famous American Whist Club of
Boston, and under the able leadership of its captain, Harry H.
Ward, it has demonstrated that he can take any kind of a team
and beat any of the old style long-suit players, no matter how skilful
they may be. The following is a brief outline of the American
game, as given by Captain Ward in <i>Whist</i> for May, 1906:&mdash;</p>

<p><i><b>Five-trump Hands.</b></i> With five trumps, and the suits split,
3, 3, 2, we always open a trump, unless we have a tenace over the
turn-up card. From five trumps and a five-card plain suit, we open
the suit if it is one that will require some help to establish; otherwise
the trump. From five trumps with a four-card plain suit, we
open the trump with hands of moderate strength; otherwise the
plain suit.</p>

<p><i><b>Four-trump Hands.</b></i> From four-trump hands we invariably
open a suit of five cards or more, but prefer to avoid a four-card
suit headed by a single honor. These are the suits in which
the best chance for a single trick usually occurs when the suit is
led by some one else. For example: Hearts trumps:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Cards">
  <tr>
    <td>♡ 8 7 6 3</td>
    <td>♣ 9 8</td>
    <td>♢ K 8 3 2</td>
    <td>♠ K 4 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The best opening from such a hand is the club nine.</p>

<p>When forced to open single-honor suits, the lead of the lowest
card shows an honor as good as the Queen, while the lead of an
intermediate card denies such an honor, as in the following examples:
hearts trumps:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Cards">
  <tr>
    <td>♡ 10 8 3 2</td>
    <td>♣ K 6</td>
    <td>♢ Q 7 6 4</td>
    <td>♠ Q 5 4</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">From this we should lead the four of diamonds; but holding</p>

  <tr>
    <td>♡ 10 8 3 2</td>
    <td>♣ K 6</td>
    <td>♢ J 8 7 4</td>
    <td>♠ Q 5 4</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">we should lead the seven of diamonds.</p>

<p>From hands containing four trumps and three three-card suits,
we use our own judgment, sometimes leading the trump, and sometimes
a plain suit. We prefer the plain suit if it is a desirable one
to open, such as hearts trumps:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">we should lead the deuce of trumps. If in this hand the club suit
were Q J 3, the Queen of clubs would be the best opening.</p>

<p>It may seem paradoxical that a weaker hand should call for a
trump lead; but the opening is not an attack. It is a move to await
developments.</p>

<p><i><b>Three-trump Hands.</b></i> From hands containing three trumps
or less, our opening leads vary from the ordinary player’s game
more than in any other particular. We always open a long suit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
from three-trump hands if the suit is a good one, such as A K and
others, K Q and others, or even Q J and others. But without such
strength in the long suit, we let it severely alone, and develop the
hand with a short-suit or “gambit” opening.</p>

<p>With three trumps and a five-card suit containing two honors
not in sequence, we still open the long suit if we have a sure re-entry
in another suit. This, for example, hearts trumps:&mdash;</p>

    <td>♠ A 10</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">The trey of diamonds is the best opening. If there were no re-entry,
such as only 10 2 of spades instead of A 10, we should open
the 10 of spades.</p>

<p>Although we open a great many short suits, we avoid weak three-card
suits except in rare instances.</p>

<p>While our system, like all others, entails losses at times, it seems
to avoid many of the pitfalls that confront the player who always
opens his long suit, regardless of the possibilities of ever bringing
it in. In many instances we find he places himself in the worst
possible position for any chance to make even one trick in the suit
he opens.</p>

<p>We admit that if a team adopts straight American leads, it is
much easier for them to count the partner’s hand accurately; but
it seems to me that this advantage is more than overcome by the
fact that in our openings we have a clear idea as to the general
character of the partner’s hand while there is still time to take
advantage of the knowledge. In the long-suit game this element
is entirely wanting.</p>

<p><i><b>IN CONCLUSION.</b></i> The first-class whist-player is usually
developed gradually. If he possess the faculty of paying close
attention to the game while he is playing, nothing should prevent
his rapid progress. At first he may care little or nothing for
“book” whist, but after some experience with book players, he is
rather in danger of running to the other extreme, and putting more
book into his game than it will carry. Having passed that stage,
his next step is usually to invent some system of his own, and to
experiment with every hand he plays. By degrees he finds that all
special systems of play have some serious defects which over-balance
their advantages, and this discovery gradually brings him
back to first principles. If he gets so far safely, his game for all
future time will probably be sound, common-sense whist, without
any American leads, plain-suit echoes, or four-signals, and free
from any attempts to take fourteen tricks with thirteen cards.</p>

<p>When a whist-player reaches that point, he is probably as near
the first class as the natural limitations of his mental abilities will
ever permit him to go.</p>

<p><i><b>THE LAWS</b></i> will be found at the end of the Whist Family of
Games.</p>

<p><i><b>No. 1.</b></i> This is a fine example of the <i><b>Long-suit Game</b></i>. The
leader begins with one of the high cards of his long suit. Missing
the 2, he knows some one is signalling for trumps, and as it is very
unlikely that the adversaries would signal while he was in the lead,
he assumes it is his partner, and leads his best trump. His partner
does not return the trump, because he holds major tenace over the
king, which must be in Y’s hand. At trick 5 B still holds major
tenace in trumps, and leads a small card of his long suit to try to
get A into the lead again. If A leads trumps again, his only possible
card of re-entry for his club suit is gone. At trick 7, if B
draws Y’s king, he kills A’s card of re-entry at the same time.</p>

<p><i><b>No. 2.</b></i> This is an excellent example of the <i><b>American Game</b></i>.
A has a three-trump hand, but his long suit is not headed by two
honors in sequence, and the Queen of clubs cannot be considered
as a re-entry, so A makes the gambit opening of the singleton
diamond. His partner, having nothing in plain suits, immediately
returns the diamond. A now leads an intermediate club, and B
forces him again. At trick 6, A avoids changing suits. If the long
spade suit is opened, and Z returns the diamond 10, A-B will make
four tricks less on this hand.</p>

<p><i><b>No. 3.</b></i> This example of the <i><b>Short-suit Game</b></i> is from Val
Starnes’ Short-Suit Whist. This is sometimes called the Gambit
opening. The leader, having no reason to lead trumps, even with
five, and not having three honours in his long suit, prefers the
gambit opening of the singly guarded queen. Y holds what is
called a potential or imperfect fourchette, and covers, in order to
make A-B play two honours to get one trick. B also makes a
gambit opening by returning a supporting spade. Three tricks
are gained by the two leads of the supporting cards, and five would
have been made but for Y’s covering on the first trick.</p>

<p><i><b>No. 4.</b></i> This is an example of <i><b>Playing to the Score</b></i>.
The game is English Whist, 5 points, counting honours. The
first lead of trumps shows Z that honours are divided, and that he
must make 11 tricks to win the game. At trick 3, he must trump;
to discard clubs would be inconsistent with refusing to trump in
order to bring them in. At trick 4, if Y cannot win a trick in clubs
and give Z a finesse in trumps, Z cannot win the game. At trick
7, both black queens are against Z, and he must take the best
chance to win if the diamond ace is also against him. The adversaries
cannot place the club ace, and so Z underplays in clubs as
his only chance for the game.</p>

<p class="tb"><i><b>PRUSSIAN WHIST.</b></i> This is the ordinary 5, 7 or 10
point whist, with or without honours, except that instead of turning
up the last card for trump, the player to the left of the dealer
cuts a trump from the still pack, which is shuffled and presented
to him by the dealer’s partner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>FAVOURITE WHIST.</b></i> This is the regular 5, 7 or 10 point
whist, with or without honours, except that whichever suit is cut
for the trump on the first deal of the rubber is called <i><b>the favourite</b></i>.
Whenever the suit turns up for trump, after the first deal,
tricks and honours count double towards game. There must be a
new favourite at the beginning of each rubber, unless the same suit
happens to be cut again.</p>

<p>A variation is to attach a progressive value to the four suits;
tricks being worth 1 point when Spades are trumps; when Clubs 2;
when Diamonds 3; and when Hearts 4. Honours do not count,
and the game is 10 points, made by tricks alone. The hands are
played out; the winners score all tricks taken, and the winners of
the rubber add 10 points for bonus.
The value of the rubber is the difference
between the scores of the
winners and that of the losers. For
instance: If the rubber is in A-B’s
favour with the score shown in the
margin A-B win a rubber of 8 points.</p>

<h3>DUPLICATE WHIST.</h3>

<p>Duplicate whist is not a distinct game, but is simply the name
given to that manner of playing whist in which a number of
hands are played over again with the same cards, but by different
persons.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> The cards have the same rank as at whist; they are
dealt in the same manner, and the same rules apply to all irregularities
in the deal, except that a misdealer must deal again. The
objects of the game are the same, and so are all the suggestions
for good play. The only differences that require attention are the
positions of the players, the manner of counting the tricks, and the
methods of keeping and comparing the scores.</p>

<p><i><b>THEORY.</b></i> It may briefly be stated that duplicate proceeds
upon the principle that if two partners have made a certain number
of tricks with certain cards, under certain conditions with respect
to the lead, distribution of the other cards in the adversaries’
hands, etc., the only way to decide whether or not two other players
could have done better, or cannot do so well, is to let them try
it, by giving them the same cards, under exactly similar conditions.</p>

<p>This comparison may be carried out in various ways; but in
every instance it depends entirely upon the number and arrangement
of the players engaged. The most common forms are:
club against club; team against team; pair against pair; or man
against man. The reason for the arrangement of the players will
be better understood if we first describe the method.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> There is no cutting for
partners, and choice of seats and cards as at whist, because the
players take their places and deal according to a pre-arranged
schedule.</p>

<p>The player to the left of the dealer begins by placing the card
he leads face up on the table, and in front of him. The second
player follows by placing his card in front of him in the same manner;
and so the third, and so the fourth. The four cards are then
turned face down, and the dealer takes up the trump. The partners
winning the trick place their cards lengthwise, pointing
towards each other; the adversaries place theirs across. At the
end of the hand, the number of tricks taken by each side can be
seen by glancing at any player’s cards. If there is any discrepancy,
a comparison of the turned cards will show in which trick it
occurs, and the cards can be readily faced and examined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p101.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Diagram of the turned cards" />
</div>

<p>N &amp; S 6; E &amp; W 7. East has made a mistake in turning the
fifth trick.</p>

<p><i><b>COUNTERS.</b></i> In some places 13 counters are placed on the
table, the winner of each trick taking down one. This system often
leads to disputes, as there can be no check upon it, and there is
nothing to show in which trick the error occurred.</p>

<p><i><b>COUNTING TRICKS.</b></i> At the end of each hand, the
players sitting North and South score the <i><b>total</b></i> number of tricks
they have taken; instead of the number in excess of a book.
Their adversaries, sitting East and West, do the same. Each
player then slightly shuffles his 13 cards; so as to conceal the
order in which they were played, and the four separate hands of
13 cards each are then left on the table, face down; the trump being
turned at the dealer’s place.</p>

<p><i><b>TRAYS.</b></i> When any apparatus is used for holding the cards,
such as trays, boxes, or envelopes, each player puts his 13 cards in
the compartment provided for them. Each tray has a mark upon
it, usually an arrow, showing which end of the tray should point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
toward a given direction, usually the North. The pocket into
which the dealer’s cards go is marked “dealer,” and it is usual to
provide a trump slip for each tray. When the hand is first dealt,
the trump is recorded on this slip, which travels round the room
with the tray. After the dealer has turned up the designated
trump, he places the trump slip in the tray, face down. When the
play of the hand is finished and the cards replaced in the tray, the
dealer puts his trump slip on the top of his cards. The four hands
can then be conveniently carried or handed to any other table to
be overplayed.</p>

<img src="images/p102.jpg" width="400" height="290" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Various Apparatus for Duplicate.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> There should be two score-cards at each table.
The various methods of putting down and comparing the scores can
best be described in connection with the variety of competition to
which they belong. It is a common practice to note the trump
card on the score sheets.</p>

<p><i><b>POSITION OF THE PLAYERS.</b></i> The four players
at each table are distinguished by the letters N S E W; North
and South being partners against East and West. West should
always be the dealer in the first hand, North having the original
lead. In all published illustrative hands, North is the leader, unless
otherwise specified.</p>

<p>The deal passes in rotation to the left, and the number of hands
played should always be some multiple of four, so that each player
may have the original lead an equal number of times. 24 hands at
each table is the usual number, and is the rule at all League tournaments.
The partners and adversaries should be changed after
each eight hands. Three changes in 24 hands will bring each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
member of a set of four into partnership with every other member
for an equal number of hands.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;">
<img src="images/p103.jpg" width="315" height="200" alt="Diagram of the position of the players at the table" />
</div>

<p>If two teams of four on a side, A B C D, and W X Y Z, play
against each other, the arrangement in a League tournament
would be as follows:&mdash;that A B C D should represent the players
of the visiting club, or challengers, and W X Y Z the home club, or
holders; and that the positions of the players should be changed
after every four hands. It is usual to play 24 hands in the afternoon,
and 24 more at night.</p>

<p>If more than four players are engaged on each side, this arrangement
must be repeated with every additional four; the tables
being always in sets of two each, but in such cases, and in fact in
anything but League matches, it is usual to play only the 1st, 3rd
and 5th sets.</p>

<p><i><b>CLUB AGAINST CLUB.</b></i> The smaller club should
put into the field as many multiples of four as it can; the larger
club presenting an equal number to play against them. The opposing
sides are then so arranged that half the members of each
club sit North and South, the other half East and West. If we
distinguish the clubs by the marks O and X, and suppose 16 to be
engaged on each side, they would be arranged at 8 tables, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The two O’s that have just played the N &amp; S hands at table
No. 1, proceed to play at table No. 2, the N &amp; S hands which have
just been played by two X’s; while the two O’s that played the
E &amp; W hands at table No. 2, overplay at table No. 1, the E &amp; W
hands just held by the two X’s.</p>

<p>It is now evident that the four O’s have held between them all
the 52 cards dealt at each table; for the first pair have held all the
N &amp; S hands dealt at both tables, and the second pair have held
all the E &amp; W hands. The same is true of the four X players;
and if there is any difference in the number of tricks taken by the
opposing fours, it is supposed to be due to a difference in skill,
other matters having been equalised as far as the limitations of the
game will permit.</p>

<p>The overplay finished, the cards are gathered, shuffled, cut,
and dealt afresh, East now having the original lead. It must be
remembered that the deal can never be lost, and that no matter
what happens, the player whose proper turn it is to deal must do
so.</p>

<p><i><b>NUMBERING HANDS.</b></i> The hands simultaneously
played are scored under the same number, but distinguished by the
number of the table at which they are first dealt. Each pair of
partners in a team play two No. 1 hands, in one of which they are
N &amp; S; in the other E &amp; W.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> The result of the hand is entered upon the score
sheets, which the opposing players at each table should then compare,
and turn them face down, leaving them on the table when
they change places.</p>

<p>Let us suppose the N &amp; S partners of the O team to make 7
tricks at table No. 1; the E &amp; W partners of the X team making
6. Each pair enters on its own score-card the number it makes.
The E &amp; W partners of the O team now come to table No. 1, and
play the 26 cards which the other members of their team did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
hold. They are not permitted to look at the score-card until the
hand has been overplayed. Then they enter the result, which
should be 6 tricks. If the total of the tricks taken by the same
team on the N &amp; S and the E &amp; W hands is not 13, it must be a
loss or a gain. At the end of the 24 hands, the result of the
match can be immediately ascertained by laying side by side the
score cards of the East and West hands played at the same table.
The North and South scores are not compared, because the laws
say they may be incorrect, but the East and West must be, officially,
right.</p>

<p>We give on the two preceding pages an illustration of the full
score of a match. The check marks in the 6th column show that
the N &amp; S players compared the score with the E &amp; W before turning
down their cards. The figures in the 2nd column are the gains
on the various hands. The figures in the 7th column show which of
the four players whose names appear at the top of the score-card
were partners for that series of hands. The result shows that the O
team had a majority of one trick at table No. 1, while the X team
had a majority of three tricks at table No. 2, leaving them the winners
of the match by two tricks.</p>

<p>If sixteen players were engaged, it would be necessary to institute
a similar comparison between each set of tables, and there
would be sixteen score-cards to compare, two at a time, instead of
four.</p>

<p><i><b>TEAM AGAINST TEAM.</b></i> The methods just described
for a match of club against club are identical with those which are
used in a contest between two teams of four; the only difference
being that of proportion. In the latter case there will be only one
set, of two tables, and only four score-cards to compare.</p>

<p>The change of partners should be exhaustive in team matches;
which will require six sets.</p>

<p><i><b>TEAMS AGAINST TEAMS.</b></i> When several quartette
teams compete with one another, Howell’s system of arrangement
will be found the best. There are two methods; for odd and for
even numbers of teams.</p>

<p><i><b>Odd Numbers of Teams.</b></i> This is the simplest form of contest.
Let us suppose five teams to offer for play, which we shall
distinguish by the letters, <i><b>a</b></i>, <i><b>b</b></i>, <i><b>c</b></i>, <i><b>d</b></i>, <i><b>e</b></i>, arranging each at its own
table thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The peculiarity of this system is in the movement of the trays;
those at the middle table always going to the extreme West of the
line, the others moving up as many tables at a time as may be
necessary to follow them. In this instance the trays at table 3 go
to 1, all others moving up two tables. At the same time the
N &amp; S players all move one table further East, bringing about this
position:&mdash;</p>

<p>If we now take any two of the teams engaged, <i><b>a</b></i> and <i><b>d</b></i> for instance,
we shall find that the E &amp; W <i><b>a</b></i> and the N &amp; S <i><b>d</b></i> pairs of
those teams have played hands 9 to 12 at table 1, in the 2nd set;
and that N &amp; S <i><b>a</b></i> and E &amp; W <i><b>d</b></i> pairs have overplayed the same
hands at table 4, in the 3rd set; so that we have really been carrying
out a number of matches simultaneously, between five teams
of four players each.</p>

<p>If there are 5, 7, 9 or 11 tables in play, the movement of the
trays must be 2, 3, 4 or 5 tables at a time; but the movement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the players remains the same; one table at a time, in the direction
opposite to the trays.</p>

<p><i><b>Gilman’s System.</b></i> Another method, recommended by
Charles F. Gilman, of Boston, which prevents any possibility of
players giving hints to their friends as they pass the trays, is to have
each team play at its own table first, so as to get an individual score.
The E &amp; W players then move to the next table but one, in either
direction, going from 11 to 9; from 9 to 7, etc., the N &amp; S players
sitting still. This movement is continued until the E &amp; W players
have gone <i>twice</i> round. The trays move in the <i>same direction as
the players</i>, but only one table at a time; going from 11 to 10,
9 to 8, etc. This brings about the same result as the Howell’s
system.</p>

<p><i><b>Even Numbers of Teams.</b></i> The present method of arranging
even numbers of teams is also Gilman’s; but it requires considerable
care in the movement of the trays, because half of them
lie idle during each round, which is the same as skipping a table
in other methods.</p>

<p>Suppose we have ten tables, arranged in two rows thus, with a
team of four players at each:</p>

<table summary="Arrangement of tables">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">1</td>
    <td class="tdr">2</td>
    <td class="tdr">3</td>
    <td class="tdr">4</td>
    <td class="tdr">5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">6</td>
    <td class="tdr">7</td>
    <td class="tdr">8</td>
    <td class="tdr">9</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Taking 30 deals as the number to be played, we place trays No. 1,
2, 3, to be played and overplayed by tables 1 and 6, which are opposite
each other in the rows. Trays 4, 5, 6, we lay aside. Trays
7, 8, 9, are to be played and overplayed by tables 2 and 7; while
10, 11, 12, are laid aside, and so on until we get to tables 5 and 10,
which play and overplay trays 25, 26, 27. The easiest way to manage
this is to give tray No. 2 to table 6, while tray 1 is at table 1,
and then to let table 1 take tray 2, while table 6 plays tray 3. Then
table 1 will get tray 3, while table 6 overplays tray 1. This will
make all the trays come in numerical order to table 1, and will act
as a check.</p>

<p>The play of the first round, three deals, finished, the E &amp; W
players all move one table, 2 going to 1, 3 to 2, etc. The umpire
now brings into play the trays that were idle, giving trays 4, 5, 6,
to tables 1 and 6; trays 10, 11, 12, to tables 2 and 7, and so on
down the line, all the trays that were used in the first round lying
idle.</p>

<p>Again the players move, and now table 1 gets the 7, 8, 9, set of
trays to overplay with table 6, and so on; so that all the sets move
up a table after each intervening round, and table 1 will get all the
trays from 1 to 30 in order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> In both the foregoing systems, each pair should
have its own score-card, and should mark the name of the team it
plays against for each series of four hands. These score-cards are
more for private reference than anything else in tournaments; because
there is always a professional scorer, for whose use small
slips are filled out and collected from the tables at the end of each
round. The winner is the team that wins the most matches; not
the one that gains the most tricks. In case of ties, the number of
tricks won must decide. If the number of tricks taken by each side
is a tie in any match, the score is marked zero, and each team
counts half a match won. We give an illustration of the final
score in a match between five teams. The <i><b>c</b></i> and <i><b>d</b></i> teams are
tied for a second place in the number of matches; but the <i><b>c</b></i> team
takes third place, because it has lost one more trick than the <i><b>d</b></i>
team. The <i><b>b</b></i> and <i><b>c</b></i> teams score a half match; so do the <i><b>c</b></i> and <i><b>e</b></i>
teams.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p110.jpg" width="500" height="240" alt="A score card" />
</div>

<p><i><b>PAIR AGAINST PAIR.</b></i> This is the most interesting
form of competition, especially for domestic parties, as the arrangement
of the players will allow of great latitude in the number engaged,
table after table being added as long as players offer to fill
them.</p>

<p><i><b>Two Pairs.</b></i> When only four players are engaged at a single
table, the game is called Memory Duplicate; which is forbidden in
all first-class clubs. The players retain their seats until they have
played an agreed number of hands, which are laid aside one by
one in trays. No trump is turned in Memory Duplicate; one suit
being declared trumps for the entire sitting.</p>

<p>Instead of the players changing positions for the overplay, the
trays are reversed. If the indicators pointed N &amp; S on the original
deals, they must lie E &amp; W for the overplay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Original Position of Trays.</span> <span class="smcap">Position for Overplay.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> The E &amp; W hands only are scored, the card being
laid aside after the original play is completed, and a new card used
for the overplay. The difference in the totals of these two sets of
score-cards will show which pair gained the most tricks.</p>

<p><i><b>Four Pairs.</b></i> These should be arranged at two tables, changing
adversaries after every 8 hands. The third set will exhaust
the combinations, and it will then be found that each pair has
played and overplayed an equal number of hands against every
other pair.</p>

<p>Four hands are dealt at each table in each set, and then exchanged.
The trump card is turned for every original deal.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> Each pair carries its own score-card with it from
table to table, until the 24 hands have been played. The 7th
column is used to designate the pair played against. The pairs at
the second table should begin scoring with hands Nos. 5, 13 and 21
respectively; as they will presently receive from the first table the
series beginning 1, 9 and 17 respectively. Eight hands complete
a match, and the result must be tabulated in the same manner as

<p>The <i><b>a</b></i> pair wins the tie with <i><b>d</b></i>, being 6 tricks plus.</p>

<p><i><b>Six Pairs.</b></i> This is a very awkward number to handle, and
should be avoided if possible. The whole could be played at three
tables simultaneously; but such a course would necessitate their
changing places ten times, following a very complicated schedule
in so doing. The simplest way to handle six pairs is to arrange
them at three tables, two of which are constantly in play, the third
only half the time. This is the first position:&mdash;</p>

<p>No notice is taken of the scores made by the N &amp; S hands in

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> Each pair against each is considered a match, and
the winner of the most matches wins, tricks deciding ties.</p>

<p><i><b>Compass Whist.</b></i> When we come to handle large numbers,
the changes of position become too complicated, and the simplest
plan is to arrange them at as many tables as they will fill, and to
place on each table an equal number of trays. At the Knickerbocker
Whist Club, New York, which is still famous for its compass
games, they play a minimum of 24 trays, or get as near that
number as possible. If there are 14 tables, they play two deals
at each. If there are only 10 tables, they play 30 trays.</p>

<p>All the N &amp; S players sit still, and at the end of each round, two
or three deals as the case may be, all the E &amp; W players move up
one table, 2 going to 1, 3 to 2, etc. Each pair keeps its own score
card, on which is put down the number of the tray, the number of
the pair played against, which is always the number of the table at
which they started; one of the pairs remaining there being No. 3
N &amp; S, the other moving away, being No. 3 E &amp; W.</p>

<p>Each pair adds up its score card at the end, and puts down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
total number of tricks they have won. The names of the players
having been previously written on the blackboard, their scores are
put down opposite their names, each side, N &amp; S and E &amp; W, is
then added up in order to find the average, and all scores above
average are plus, while all below average are minus.</p>

<p>The following is an example of the averaging of a game in which
five tables took part, playing 30 deals:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <i><b>e</b></i> and <i><b>f</b></i> pairs make the best scores N &amp; S and E &amp; W respectively;
the <i><b>f</b></i> pair, having won the greatest number of tricks
above the average of the hands, would be the winners.</p>

<p><i><b>Howell Pair System.</b></i> A very popular system of managing
pairs in club games, and also in the national tournaments for the
Minneapolis trophy, is called the Howell Pairs. Indicator cards
are placed on the tables, which show each player the number of the
table and the position at that table to which he should move next.
Sometimes he will sit N, sometimes S, and sometimes E or W, but
he always finds his partner opposite him, and at the end of the
game he will have had every other pair in the game for an adversary
once, and will have played all the hands dealt.</p>

<p>A different set of indicator cards is required for every different
number of tables in the game. They are the invention of the
late E.C. Howell of Washington, D.C., and have been arranged
for any number of pairs from four to thirty-four.</p>

<p><i><b>INDIVIDUALS.</b></i> When four play memory duplicate, one
of the four, usually S, retains his seat and keeps the score, the
others changing places right and left alternately, each playing with
S as a partner for 8 hands. These changes successively bring
about the three following positions:&mdash;</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the hands which are here scored N
&amp; S, in the 5th column, were E &amp; W when originally dealt; so
that the 1st and 5th columns are really the same hands. The
score-card should be folded down the middle during the overplay,
so that the original scores cannot be seen. It is even better to use
a new card.</p>

<p><i><b>Foster’s System</b></i> of playing two pairs at one table, which was
used at all the matches for the Utica Trophy, in which one pair
from a club challenged the pair that held the trophy for another
club, consisted in having an umpire to transpose the suits between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the original and the overplay of the deals. The trays containing
the hands were sent in to the umpire’s room, and he had an extra
pack of cards, from which he duplicated each hand of thirteen
cards as he took it out of the pocket to which it belonged, but
changed the suits, making clubs trumps instead of hearts, etc.
This system was found to do away with the memory part of the
game, it being very difficult to recognize a hand unless it had some
startling feature.</p>

<p>Coupled with the present practice of throwing out all hands in
which there is found to be a suit of more than six cards, and dealing
it over again, Foster’s system for two pairs is the best so far
suggested.</p>

<p><i><b>Eight Individuals.</b></i> This form of contest is seldom used,
because players dislike the continual changing of position, and the
delay in arriving at the results of the score. It would require
seven sets to exhaust the combinations; and at each table two
hands should be dealt, played, and exchanged with the other table
in the set, before the players change positions. This would require
28 hands to complete the match.</p>

<p><i><b>Safford’s System</b></i> for arranging the players is to have indicator
cards on the tables:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p116.jpg" width="400" height="115" alt="Diagram of the position of the players at the table when using Safford’s System" />
</div>

<p>The players take their seats in any order for the first set; after
which they go to the next higher number; 8 keeping his seat, and
7 going to 1.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> Each individual must keep his own score, adding up
the total tricks taken in each set of four hands. These totals must
then be compared with those of the player occupying the same
position, N, S, E, or W, at the other table in the set; and it will
save time in the end if these are tabulated at once, on a sheet prepared
for the purpose. For instance: Let this be the arrangement
of eight players in the first set:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Positions of the players">

</table>

<p>If <i><b>a</b></i> and <i><b>c</b></i> take 34 tricks E &amp; W; <i><b>e</b></i> and <i><b>g</b></i> taking only 30 with
the same cards, either <i><b>a</b></i> and <i><b>c</b></i> must have gained them, or <i><b>e</b></i> and
<i><b>g</b></i> must have lost them. It is a waste of time to put down both
losses and gains, and all that is necessary is to call the top score
zero, and charge all players with the loss of as many tricks as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
total is short of the top score. In this case we charge <i><b>e</b></i> and <i><b>g</b></i>
with a loss of 4 each. It must be obvious that <i><b>f</b></i> and <i><b>h</b></i> have also
made 4 more tricks than <i><b>b</b></i> and <i><b>d</b></i>; and that the latter must be
charged with a loss of 4 on the same hands that <i><b>e</b></i> and <i><b>g</b></i> lose on.</p>

<p>We give as an illustration a sheet balanced in this way, showing
the losses of the various players. The totals at the end of the match
show that <i>c</i> is the winner, losing less tricks than any other player.</p>

<p><i><b>Large Numbers of Individuals.</b></i> Several ingenious
methods have been devised for handling large numbers of players,
especially in domestic parties; Safford and Mitchell having both
distinguished themselves in this line. The simplest form has
been suggested by Mitchell, and is especially adapted for social
gatherings of ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>As many tables as possible are filled; all the ladies sitting N &amp;
E; the gentlemen S and W.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p117b.jpg" width="400" height="115" alt="Diagram of the position of the players at the table" />
</div>

<p>The number of hands dealt at each table must be adjusted to
the number of tables filled, and the time to be devoted to play.
The trays containing the hands are passed to the West, and all
the gentlemen move one table to the East, the ladies sitting still.
In all the changes each gentleman keeps to his original point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the compass, South or West. When he arrives at the table he
started from, the round is finished. If an odd number of tables
are engaged in play, the changes may take place in regular order
to the end. If even, a dummy must be put in; but as that is
objectionable in a social gathering, it is better to adopt one of the
two systems following, unless half the number of tables is an odd
number, when the method already described may be used.</p>

<p><i><b>1st Method.</b></i> Some table in the series, which must not be
either the first or the last, deals no original hands, but overplays
all the hands coming from the other tables to the East of it. The
four players sit still, taking no part in the progression; thus obliging
those whose turn it would be to play at their table to pass on
to the next.</p>

<p><i><b>2nd Method.</b></i> Each gentleman should carefully note the
number of the hand originally dealt at the table from which he
starts. He progresses until he meets this hand again. The first
to observe this should give notice to the company by a bell tap, as
all the gentlemen must meet their original hands at the same time.
Instead of stopping at the table at which this tray is encountered,
all the gentlemen move on to the next, leaving the trays as they
are. This skip enables each to finish the round without playing
any of the hands twice.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> There must be four winners; the ladies with the
best scores for the N &amp; E hands respectively, and the gentlemen
with the best S &amp; W scores. If a choice is necessary, the lady
and the gentleman taking the greatest number of tricks above the
average should be selected as the winners.</p>

<p><i><b>MARRIED COUPLES.</b></i> Safford has an ingenious schedule
for eight married couples, so arranged in two sets that no husband
and wife are ever in the same set at the same time. When
seven sets have been played, every lady will have overplayed four
hands against every other lady and gentleman, including four held
by her husband. The same will be true of every man. Indicators
are placed on the tables to show players their successive positions.
The numbers represent the husbands, and the letters the wives,
the couples being a-1, b-2, etc. The couple a-1 always sit still;
the ladies go to the next higher letter of the alphabet, and the men to
the next higher number; <i><b>h</b></i> going to <i><b>b</b></i>, as <i><b>a</b></i> sits still; and 8 to 2.</p>

</div>

<p>One hand is dealt at each table, and overplayed at each of the
others. A different point of the compass should deal at each table,
in order to equalise the lead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> The score of each four hands should be added up
by each individual player, and the results tabulated at the end of
every four hands, in the manner described for eight individuals.
The winner is the player who loses the fewest tricks. This is the
only known system for deciding whether or not a man can play
whist better than his wife.</p>

<p><i><b>PROGRESSIVE DUPLICATE WHIST</b></i> is the generic
name by which those systems of duplicate are known in
which the purpose is to have as many as possible of the players
meet one another during the progress of the match. Most of the
systems we have been describing belong to this class.</p>

<h4>THE LAWS OF DUPLICATE WHIST.</h4>

<p><i>The Laws of Duplicate Whist as Amended and Adopted at the
Whist Congress, Niagara Falls, New York, July, 1900; as
amended at the Twelfth Congress, June, 1902; as amended at
the Thirteenth Congress, July, 1903; Fourteenth A.W.L.
Congress, July, 1904; Fifteenth Congress, July, 1905; Sixteenth
Congress, July, 1906; Twentieth Congress, July 1910.</i></p>

<h5>DEFINITIONS.</h5>

<p>The words and phrases used in these laws shall be construed in
accordance with the following definitions unless such construction
is inconsistent with the context:</p>

<p>(a) The thirteen cards received by any one player are termed a
“hand.”</p>

<p>(b) The four hands into which a pack is distributed for play are
termed a “deal;” the same term is also used to designate the act
of distributing the cards to the players.</p>

<p>(c) A “tray” is a device for retaining the hands of a deal and
indicating the order of playing them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>(d) The player who is entitled to the trump card is termed the
“dealer,” whether the cards have or have not been dealt by him.</p>

<p>(e) The first play of a deal is termed “the original play;” the
second or any subsequent play of such deal, the “overplay.”</p>

<p>(f) “Duplicate Whist” is that form of the game of whist in
which each deal is played only once by each player, and in which
each deal is so overplayed as to bring the play of teams, pairs of
individuals into comparison.</p>

<p>(g) A player “renounces” when he does not follow suit to the
card led; he “renounces in error” when, although holding one or
more cards of the suit led, he plays a card of a different suit; if
such renounce in error is not lawfully corrected it constitutes a
“revoke.”</p>

<p>(h) A card is “played” whenever, in the course of play, it is
placed or dropped face upwards on the table.</p>

<p>(i) A trick is “turned and quitted” when all four players have
turned and quitted their respective cards.</p>

<h5>LAW I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Shuffling.</span></h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 1. Before the cards are dealt they must be shuffled in the
presence of an adversary or the umpire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 2. The pack must not be so shuffled as to expose the face
of any card; if a card is so exposed the pack must be reshuffled.</p>

<h5>LAW II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cutting for the Trump.</span></h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 1. The dealer must present the cards to his right hand
adversary to be cut; such adversary must take from the top of the
pack at least four cards and place them toward the dealer, leaving
at least four cards in the remaining packet; the dealer must reunite
the packets by placing the one not removed in cutting upon the
other. If, in cutting or in reuniting the separate packets, a card is
exposed, the pack must be reshuffled and cut again; if there is any
confusion of the cards or doubt as to the place where the pack was
separated, there must be a new cut.</p>

<h5>LAW III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dealing.</span></h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 1. When the pack has been properly cut and reunited, the
cards must be dealt, one at a time, face down, from the top of the
pack, the first to the player at the left of the dealer, and each successive
card to the player at the left of the one to whom the last
preceding card has been dealt. The last, which is the trump card,
must be turned and placed face up on the tray, if one is used; otherwise,
at the right of the dealer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 2. There must be a new deal&mdash;</p>

<p>(a) If any card except the last is faced or exposed in any way in
dealing;</p>

<p>(b) If the pack is proved incorrect or imperfect;</p>

<p>(c) If either more or less than thirteen cards are dealt to any
player;</p>

<p>(d) If, after the first trick has been turned and quitted on the
original play of a deal, one or more cards are found to have been
left in the tray.</p>

<h5>LAW IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Trump Card.</span></h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 1. The trump card and the number of the deal must be
recorded, before the play begins, on a slip provided for that purpose,
and must not be elsewhere recorded. Such slip must be
shown to an adversary, then turned face down and placed in the
tray, if one is used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 2. The dealer must leave the trump card face up until it
is his turn to play to the first trick; he must take the trump card
into his hand and turn down the trump slip before the second trick
is turned and quitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 3. When a deal is taken up for overplay, the dealer must
show the trump slip to an adversary, and thereafter the trump slip
and trump card shall be treated as in the case of an original deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 4. After the trump card has been lawfully taken into the
hand and the trump slip turned face down, the trump card must not
be named nor the trump slip examined during the play of the deal;
a player may, however, ask what the trump suit is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 5. If a player unlawfully looks at the trump slip, his
highest or lowest trump may be called; if a player unlawfully names
the trump card, or unlawfully shows the trump slip to his partner,
his partner’s highest or lowest trump may be called.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 6. These penalties can be inflicted by either adversary at
any time during the play of the deal in which they are incurred before
the player from whom the call can be made has played to the
current trick; the call may be repeated at each or any trick until
the card is played, but cannot be changed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 7. When a deal has been played the cards of the respective
players, including the trump card, must be placed in the tray
face down and the trump slip placed face up on top of the dealer’s
cards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 8. If on the overplay of a deal, the dealer turns a trump
card other than the one recorded on the trump slip, and such error is
discovered and corrected before the play of the deal is commenced,
the card turned in error is liable to be called.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 9. If such error is not corrected until after the overplay
has begun and more than two tables are engaged in play, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
players at that table shall take the average score for the deal; if
less than three tables are in play there must be a new deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 10. Should a player record on the trump slip a different
trump from one turned in dealing and the error be discovered at
the next table, there must be a new deal. If the deal has been
played at one or more tables with the wrong trump, the recorded
trump must be taken as correct and the players at the original table
take the average score for the deal; if less than three tables are in
play, there must be a new deal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 11. By the unanimous consent of the players in any match,
a trump suit may be declared and no trump turned.</p>

<h5>LAW V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Irregularities in the Hand.</span></h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 1. If, on the overplay, a player is found to have more than
his correct number of cards or the trump card is not in the dealer’s
hand, or any card except the trump card is so faced as to expose
any of the printing on its face, and less than three tables are engaged,
there must be a new deal. If more than two tables are in
play, the hands must be rectified and then passed to the next table;
the table at which the error was discovered must not overplay the
deal but shall take the average score.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 2. If after the first trick has been turned and quitted on
the overplay of a deal, a player is found to have less than his correct
number of cards, and the others have their correct number,
such player shall be answerable for the missing card or cards and
for any revoke or revokes which he has made by reason of its or
their absence.</p>

<h5>LAW VI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Playing, Turning and Quitting the Cards.</span></h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 1. Each player when it is his turn to play, must place his
card face up before him and towards the center of the table and
allow it to remain in this position until all have played to the trick,
when he must turn it over and place its face down and nearer to
himself, placing each successive card as he turns it, so that it overlaps
the last card played by him and with the ends towards the winners
of the trick. After he has played his card and also after he
has turned it, he must quit it by removing his hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 2. The cards must be left in the order in which they were
played and quitted until the scores for the deal are recorded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 3. During the play of a deal a player must not pick up or
turn another player’s card.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 4. Before a trick is turned and quitted any player may require
any of the other players to show the face of the card played
to that trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 5. If a player names a card of a trick which has been
turned and quitted or turns or raises any such card so that any portion
of its face can be seen by himself or his partner he is liable to
the same penalty as if he had led out of turn.</p>

<h5>LAW VII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cards Liable to be Called.</span></h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 1. The following cards are liable to be called:</p>

<p>(a) Every card so placed upon the table as to expose any of the
printing on its face, except such cards as these laws specifically
provide, shall not be so liable.</p>

<p>(b) Every card so held by a player as to expose any of the printing
on its face to his partner or to both of his adversaries at the
same time.</p>

<p>(c) Every card, except the trump card, named by the player
holding it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 2. If a player says. “I can win the rest,” “The rest are
ours,” “It makes no difference how you play,” or words to that
effect, or if he plays or exposes his remaining cards before his partner
has played to the current trick, his partner’s cards must be laid
face up on the table and are liable to be called.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 3. All cards liable to be called must be placed face up on
the table and so left until played. A player must lead or play them
when lawfully called, provided he can do so without revoking; the
call may be repeated at each or any trick until the card is played.
A player cannot, however, be prevented from leading or playing a
card liable to be called; if he can get rid of it in the course of a
play no penalty remains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 4. The holder of a card liable to be called can be required
to play it only by the adversary on his right. If such adversary
plays without calling it, the holder may play to that trick as he
pleases. If it is the holder’s turn to lead, the card must be called
before the preceding trick has been turned and quitted, or before
the holder has led a different card; otherwise he may lead as he
pleases.</p>

<h5>LAW VIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Leading out of Turn.</span></h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 1. If a player leads when it is the turn of an adversary to
lead, and the error is discovered before all have played to such
lead, a suit may be called from him or from his partner, as the
case may be, the first time thereafter it is the right of either of
them to lead. The penalty can be enforced only by the adversary
on the right of the one from whom a lead can lawfully be called,
and the right thereto is lost unless such adversary calls the suit
he desires led before the first trick won by the offender or his
partner subsequent to the offence is turned and quitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 2. If a player leads when it is his partner’s turn and the error
is discovered before all have played to such lead, a suit may at once
be called from the proper leader by his right-hand adversary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Until the penalty has been exacted, waived or forfeited, the
proper leader must not lead; should he so lead, the card led by
him is liable to be called.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 3. If a player when called on to lead a suit has none of
it, he may lead as he pleases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 4. If all have not played to a lead out of turn when the
error is discovered, the card erroneously led and all cards played
to such lead are not liable to be called, and must be taken into
the hand.</p>

<h5>LAW IX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Playing out of Turn.</span></h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 1. If the third hand plays before the second, the fourth
hand may also play before the second.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 2. If the third hand has not played and the fourth hand
plays before the second, the latter may be called upon by the third
hand to play his highest or lowest card of the suit led, and, if he
has none of that suit, to trump or not trump the trick; the penalty
cannot be inflicted after the third hand has played to the
trick. If the player liable to this penalty plays before it has been
inflicted, waived or lost, the card so played is liable to be called.</p>

<h5>LAW X.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Revoke.</span></h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 1. A renounce in error may be corrected by the player
making it, except in the following cases, in which a revoke is
established and the penalty therefore incurred:</p>

<p>(a) When the trick in which it occurs has been turned and
quitted.</p>

<p>(b) When the renouncing player or his partner, whether in his
right turn or otherwise, has led or played to the following trick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 2. At any time before the trick is turned and quitted a
player may ask an adversary if he has any of a suit, to which such
adversary has renounced in that trick, and can require the error
to be corrected in case such adversary is found to have any of
such suit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 3. If a player, who has renounced in error, lawfully
corrects his mistake, the card improperly played by him is liable
to be called, and, if he be the second or third hand player and his
left hand adversary has played to the trick before attention has
been called to the renounce, he may be required by such adversary
to play his highest or his lowest card to the trick in
which he has renounced, and shall not play to that trick until
such adversary has inflicted or waived the penalty. Any player
who has played to the trick after the renouncing player, may
withdraw his card and substitute another; a card so withdrawn
is not liable to be called.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 4. The penalty for a revoke is the transfer of two tricks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
from the revoking side to their adversaries. If more than one
revoke during the play of a deal is made by one side, the penalty
for each revoke, after the first, is the transfer of one trick only.
The revoking players cannot score more, nor their adversaries
less than the average on the deal in which the revoke occurs;
except that in no case shall the infliction of the revoke penalty
deprive the revoking players of any tricks won by them before
their first revoke occurs.</p>

<p>In Pair Matches the score shall be recorded as made, independently
of the revoke penalty, which shall be separately indicated
as plus or minus revoke (“-R” for the revoking side,
and “+R” for their adversaries). In such matches, the penalty
for a revoke shall not increase the score of the opponents of the
revoking players above the maximum, as made at the other
tables, on the deal in which the revoke occurs; provided, however,
that if the opponents win more tricks than such maximum,
independently of the revoke penalty, their score shall stand as
made. Nor shall the score of the revoking players be reduced,
by the infliction of the revoke penalty, below the minimum so
made at the other tables until the averages for the match and
the relative scores of the other players have been determined;
the score of the revoking players shall then, if necessary, be
further reduced, so that in all cases they shall suffer the full
penalty as provided in the first paragraph of this section.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 5. A revoke cannot be claimed if the claimant or his
partner has played to the following deal, or if both have left
the table at which the revoke occurred. If the revoke is discovered
in season, the penalty must be enforced and cannot be
waived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 6. At the end of the play of a deal the claimants of a
revoke can examine all of the cards; if any hand has been
shuffled the claim may be urged and proved if possible; but no
proof is necessary and the revoke is established if, after it has
been claimed, the accused player or his partner disturbs the
order of the cards before they have been examined to the satisfaction
of the adversaries.</p>

<h5>LAW XI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Miscellaneous.</span></h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 1. If any one calls attention in any manner to the trick
before his partner has played thereto, the adversary last to play
to the trick may require the offender’s partner to play his highest
or lowest of the suit led, and, if he has none of that suit, to
trump or not to trump the trick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec</span> 2. A player has the right to remind his partner that it is
his privilege to enforce a penalty and also to inform him of the
penalty he can enforce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 3. A player has the right to prevent his partner from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
committing any irregularity, and for that purpose, may ask his
partner whether or not he has a card of a suit to which he has
renounced on a trick which has not been turned and quitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 4. If either of the adversaries, whether with or without
his partner’s consent, demands a penalty to which they are
entitled, such decision is final; if the wrong adversary demands
a penalty or a wrong penalty is demanded, or either adversary
waives a penalty, none can be enforced except in case of a revoke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 5. If a player is lawfully called upon to play the highest
or lowest of a suit, to trump or not to trump a trick, to lead a
suit or to win a trick, and unnecessarily fails to comply, he is
liable to the same penalty as if he had revoked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 6. If any one leads or plays a card, and then, before his
partner has played to the trick, leads one or more other cards,
or plays two or more cards together, all of which are better
than any of his adversaries hold of the suit, his partner may be
called upon by either adversary to win the first or any subsequent
trick to which any of said cards are played, and the remaining
cards so played are liable to be called.</p>

<p>For the Rules of Etiquette of Duplicate Whist, see page 85.</p>

<h4>SINGLE TABLE, OR MNEMONIC DUPLICATE.</h4>

<p>The laws of Duplicate Whist govern where applicable, except
as follows:</p>

<p>Each player plays each deal twice, the second time playing a
hand previously played by an adversary. Instead of turning the
trump, a single suit may be declared trumps for the game. On
the overplay, the cards may be gathered into tricks instead of
playing them as required by law (Law VIII, Sec. 1). In case
of the discovery of an irregularity in the hands, there must always
be a new deal.</p>

<h4>MNEMONIC DUPLICATE FOR MORE THAN ONE TABLE.</h4>

<p>Except a contest played in comparison with a progressive
match, the replaying of the cards by the same players&mdash;“up and
back,” as it is sometimes called&mdash;is the only possible method of
approximating to Duplicate Whist for one table; but where
eight or more players participate, this form of the game is extremely
undesirable, from the element of memory entering into
the replay and destroying the integrity of the game and its
value as a test of Whist skill. It has been well described as “a
mongrel game&mdash;partly Whist and partly Dummy, but lacking in
the best features of each.”</p>

<p>In the early days of Duplicate Whist, Mnemonic Duplicate
was, to some extent, played even when several tables of players
were participating. It still survives in a few circles, chiefly
where Duplicate Whist has never been tried. It can be played under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
any of the Duplicate Whist schedules by playing them through
twice&mdash;the second time with the North and South hands given
to the East and West players, and vice versa. As each deal
is played twice by each pair, double the time is required to
play the same number of deals, as at Duplicate Whist. Allowance
must be made for this in fixing the number of deals to
be played.</p>

<p>The Snow System of movement, where practicable, is preferable.
Where the Howell pair system of movement is used, the
scores do not require “equating”, as they are equalised on the
replay. Under other systems, only the North and South scores
need be kept, as the comparison can be made quite as readily
as by direct comparison of these scores.</p>

<h3>DUMMY.</h3>

<p>There are three forms of Dummy: The English game, for
three players; the French game, for three or four: and the game
now generally known as Bridge, or Bridge Whist. Dummy is
not recognized in any form by the American Whist League, and
there are no American Laws governing it. We shall describe
each variety of the game in its turn; beginning with the English.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards.</b></i> <i><b>ENGLISH DUMMY</b></i>, is played with a full pack
of fifty-two cards, ranking as at whist both for cutting and playing.
Two packs are generally used.</p>

<p><i><b>Markers</b></i> are necessary, and are of the same patterns as those
used in whist.</p>

<p><i><b>Players.</b></i> According to the English usage, Dummy is played
by three persons, and the table is complete with that number.</p>

<p>They cut for partners and for the deal; the player cutting the
lowest card takes dummy for the first rubber; the one cutting the
next lowest takes dummy for the second rubber; and the one
cutting the highest takes it for the last rubber. It is considered
obligatory to play three rubbers, in order that each may have
whatever advantage or disadvantage may be supposed to attach
to the dummy. The three rubbers so played are called a Tournée.
It is sometimes agreed that one player shall take dummy continuously,
on condition that he concedes to his adversaries one point
in each rubber. When this is done, the largest rubber that the
dummy’s partner can win is one of seven; and he may win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
nothing; whereas his adversaries may win a rubber of nine, and
must win at least two. This concession of a point is not made, as
many imagine, because it is an advantage to have the (dummy)
partner’s hand exposed; but because it is an advantage to have
the player’s hand concealed. He knows the collective contents of
the adversaries’ hands; each of them knows only the contents of
dummy’s hand and his own.</p>

<p><i><b>Cutting.</b></i> The player cutting the lowest card has the choice of
seats and cards; but he must deal the first hand for his dummy;
not for himself. The methods of spreading, cutting, deciding ties,
etc., described in connection with whist, are those employed in
dummy.</p>

<p><i><b>Position of the Players.</b></i> The players are distinguished, as
at whist, by the two first and last letters of the alphabet, and their
positions at the table are indicated in the same manner. There is
no mark to distinguish the dummy hand; a defect which is remedied
in the French system.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> At the beginning of a rubber, dummy’s partner
presents the pack to his <i><b>left-hand</b></i> adversary to be cut, and deals
from right to left, beginning with the player on his right, and turning
up the last card for dummy’s trump. When two packs are
used, there is no rule as to which player shall collect and shuffle
the still pack. On this point the French rules are very explicit.</p>

<p>The general rules with regard to irregularities in the deal are
the same as at whist.</p>

<p>The cards having been dealt, it is usual for dummy’s partner to
take up and sort the dummy first. There are several ways of
laying out dummy’s hand; the most common being to run the
suits down in rows, with the turn-up across and to the right of the
other trumps, if any.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Method of Spreading Dummy’s Cards.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i><b>Stakes.</b></i> The remarks made on this subject in connection with
whist apply equally to dummy. Dummy’s partner must pay to,
or receive from each adversary the amount agreed.</p>

<p><i><b>Method of Playing.</b></i> The general method of playing is
identical with that of whist, with the following exceptions:&mdash;</p>

<p>When it is dummy’s turn to play, his partner selects the card.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>The Revoke.</b></i> For this dummy is not liable to any penalty, as
his adversaries can see his cards. Even should the revoke be
occasioned by dummy’s cards being disarranged, or one of them
covered up, the adversaries should be as able to detect the error as
the partner. Should dummy’s hand revoke, it cannot be remedied
after the trick in which it occurs has been turned and quitted;
and the game must proceed as if no revoke had occurred. All the
penalties for a revoke may be enforced against dummy’s partner,
should he renounce in error, and not correct it in time. There
being no American laws for dummy, the English penalty of three
tricks or three points may be enforced, and the revoking player
cannot win the game that hand.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards Played in Error.</b></i> Dummy’s partner is not liable to
any penalty for cards dropped face upwards on the table, or two or
more played at once, because it is obvious that Dummy cannot
gain any advantage from such exposed cards.</p>

<p><i><b>Leading out of Turn.</b></i> Should either dummy or his partner
lead out of turn, the adversaries may call a suit from the one that
should have led. It should be noticed that if it was not the turn
of either to lead, there is no penalty; for neither can have gained
any advantage from knowing what suit the other wished to lead,
or from the exposed card. Should all have played to the erroneous
lead, the error cannot be corrected, and no penalty remains.</p>

<p>The methods of <i><b>Taking Tricks</b></i>; <i><b>Scoring</b></i>; <i><b>Claiming and
Counting Honours</b></i>; <i><b>Marking Rubber Points</b></i>, etc., are the
same as in whist, and the counters are used in the same manner.</p>

<p><i><b>Cutting Out.</b></i> As already observed, there is no change of
partners, or of the rotation of the deal, until the completion of a
rubber; but at the beginning of each rubber, dummy must deal
the first hand. Should one side win the first two games in any
rubber, the third is not played. At the end of the tournée, should
any player wish to retire, and another offer to take his place, the
cards must be shuffled and cut as at the beginning; a player’s
position in one tournée giving him no rights in the next. There is
nothing in the English game to recognize that there may be more
than three candidates for dummy; as it is supposed that if four
were present, they would prefer playing whist.</p>

<p><i><b>Suggestions for Good Play.</b></i> As these are equally proper
to any form of dummy, we shall postpone their consideration until
we have described the other varieties of the game; French dummy,
and Bridge; giving them all at the end of the chapter on “Bridge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<h3>DOUBLE DUMMY.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Double Dummy is played with a full pack of fifty-two
cards, ranking as at whist both for cutting and playing. Two
packs are generally used.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKERS</b></i> are necessary, and are of the same description
as those used in whist.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> According to the English usage, double dummy
is played by two persons, and the table is complete with that
number.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> The players cut for the deal; the player cutting
the lowest card deals for his dummy first, and has the choice of
sitting to the right or left of his opponent. It is usual to select
the seat on the right of the living player, because it is possible
that one may forget whether or not certain cards have been played,
and under such circumstances it is better to lead up to an exposed
hand than to one whose contents you are not sure of.</p>

<p>The methods of spreading, cutting, deciding ties, etc., are the
same as those employed at whist.</p>

<p><i><b>POSITION OF THE PLAYERS.</b></i> It is not usually
considered necessary to distinguish the players further than to indicate
which hand had the original lead. For this purpose the
whist notation is used, A being the leader, and Z the dealer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/p130.jpg" width="250" height="115" alt="Diagram of the position of the players at the table" />
</div>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> When two packs are used, the still pack should
be shuffled by the non-dealer, and placed on the left of the player
or dummy whose turn it will be to deal next.</p>

<p>The general rules with regard to irregularities in the deal are
the same as in whist.</p>

<p>The cards being dealt, it is usual to sort the dummy hands first,
running the suits down in rows, with the turn-up trump across,
and to the right of the others.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> The remarks already made on this subject in connection
with whist and dummy, apply equally to double dummy,
except that there is no double payment; but each player wins
from or loses to his living adversary the unit agreed upon.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> This so closely resembles
dummy as to need no further description. Neither dummy can
revoke, and there are no such things as exposed cards, or cards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
played in error. It is very common for one player to claim that
he will win a certain number of tricks, and for his adversary to
admit it, and allow him to score them, without playing the hand
out.</p>

<p><i><b>LEADING OUT OF TURN.</b></i> Should either of the
dummies or the players lead out of turn, the adversary may call a
suit from the one that ought to have led; but if it was the turn of
neither, there is no penalty. If all four have played to the trick,
the error cannot be corrected, and no penalty remains.</p>

<p>The methods of <i><b>Taking Tricks</b></i>; <i><b>Scoring</b></i>; <i><b>Claiming and
Counting Honours</b></i>; <i><b>Marking Rubber Points</b></i>, etc., are the
same as in whist, and the counters are used in the same manner.</p>

<p><i><b>RUBBERS.</b></i> If the first two games are won by the same
player and his dummy, the third is not played. Tournées are not
played, and the completion of the rubber breaks up the table.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING IN.</b></i> The table being complete with two, at the
end of a rubber a new table must be formed.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> The player
should first carefully examine the exposed hands, and by comparing
them with his own, suit by suit, should fix in his mind the
cards held by his living adversary. This takes time, and in many
places it is the custom to expose the four hands upon the table.
Players who have better memories than their opponents object to
this, for the same reason that they prefer sitting on the right of the
living player. It is not at all uncommon for a player to forget that
certain cards have been played, to his very serious loss.</p>

<p>The hands once fixed in the mind, some time should be given to
a careful consideration of the best course to pursue; after which
the play should proceed pretty rapidly until the last few tricks,
when another problem may present itself.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the game beyond the skilful use of the tenace
position, discarding, and establishing cross-ruffs. Analysis is the
mental power chiefly engaged. There are no such things as inferences,
false cards, finesse, underplay, speculative trump leads, or
judgment of human nature. The practice of the game is totally
different from any other form of whist, and much more closely resembles
chess.</p>

<p>The laws of Dummy will be found at the end of the English
Whist Laws.</p>

<h3>HUMBUG WHIST.</h3>

<p>This is a variation on double dummy, in which two players sit
opposite each other. The deal and seats are cut for in the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
manner; four hands of thirteen cards each are dealt, and the last
card is turned for trump.</p>

<p>Each player examines the hand dealt to him, without touching
those to his right or left. If he is content with his hand, he announces
it, if not, he may exchange it for the one on his right. In
case of exchange, the discarded hand is placed on the table face
down; and the other taken up and played. If a player retains the
hand originally dealt him, he must not look at the others. If the
dealer exchanges, he loses the turn-up card, but the trump suit remains
the same. Each player deals for himself in turn, there
being no deal for the dead hands. Whist laws govern the deal
and its errors.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The dealer’s adversary has
the first lead; the other must follow suit if he can, and the highest
card of the suit led wins the trick. Trumps win all other suits.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> Each trick above six counts one point towards
game. Of the four honours, A K Q J of trumps, if each player
holds two, neither can count. But if one player has only one
honour, or none, the other counts 2 points for two honours, if he
holds them; 3 points for three; and 4 points for four. The honours
count towards game as in whist. The penalty for a revoke is
three tricks, and it takes precedence of other scores; tricks count
next, honours last. Five points is game.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> It is considered
best for a player not finding four reasonably sure tricks in his
hand to exchange; for there is a certain advantage to be gained by
knowing thirteen cards which cannot be in the adversary’s hand.
Before changing, the player should fix in his memory the exact
cards of each suit in the hand which he is about to discard. By
combining his knowledge of them with his own cards, he may
often be able to direct his play to advantage. Beyond this there is
little skill in the game.</p>

<p>A variation is sometimes made by the dealer announcing a
trump suit after he has examined his hand, instead of turning up
the last card. His adversary then has the right either to play his
hand, or to exchange it for the one on his right; but the dealer
must play the hand dealt to him.</p>

<h3>THIRTEEN AND THE ODD.</h3>

<p>This is Humbug Whist without the discard. The dealer gives
thirteen cards to his adversary and to himself, one at a time, and
turns up the next for the trump. The trump card belongs to neither
player. The winner of the odd trick scores a point. Five points is
game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<h3>MORT. WHIST À TROIS; OR FRENCH DUMMY.</h3>

<p><i><b>MORT</b></i> means simply the dead hand; and is the equivalent of
the English word Dummy; the partner being known as <i><b>Vivant</b></i>,
or the living hand. In these words the English usually sound the
<i><b>t</b></i>, as they do in such words as <i><b>piquet</b></i>, and <i><b>valet</b></i>.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Mort is played with a full pack of fifty-two cards,
ranking as at whist for cutting and playing. Two packs are generally
used.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKERS</b></i> are necessary to count the game points only.
Four circular counters for each side, preferably of different colours,
are employed, or the ordinary whist markers may be used. At
the end of each game, the score of the points won or lost by each
player must be transferred to a score-sheet, kept for that purpose.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Mort is played by three persons; but the table
is usually composed of four. If there are more than four candidates,
the methods described in connection with whist are adopted
for deciding which four shall play the first tournée.</p>

<p>The table being formed, the cards are again shuffled and spread
to cut for partners and deal.</p>

<p><i><b>TIES</b></i> are decided in the same manner as at whist.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> If there are three players, the one cutting the
lowest card takes dummy for the first game; he also has the
choice of seats and cards, and may deal the first hand for himself
or for Mort, as he pleases; but having once made his choice, he
must abide by it. The player cutting the intermediate card takes
dummy for the second game; and the player cutting the highest
card takes it for the third game; each in turn having the choice
of seats and cards. These three games finish the rubber or
tournée, each having once had the advantage or disadvantage of
playing with Mort. It is obligatory to finish the tournée, no player
being allowed to withdraw and substitute another without the consent
of the other players. In Mort it is very unusual for one person
to take dummy continuously.</p>

<p>If there are four players, the one cutting the highest card of the
four sits out, and takes no part in the first game. It is customary
for him to take Mort’s seat, and to make himself useful in sorting
dummy’s cards for him. He plays in the three following games,
taking Mort in the fourth, or last. Four games complete the tournée
for four players.</p>

<p><i><b>POSITION OF THE PLAYERS.</b></i> The players or
hands are distinguished by the letters, M, V, L, and R; which
stand respectively for Mort, Vivant, Left, and Right. The Mort
is the dead hand, which is turned face up on the table. The Vivant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
is his partner, who sits opposite him, and plays his cards for
him. The Left and Right are the adversaries who sit on the
left and right of <i><b>Mort</b></i>.</p>

<p>Special attention must be called to the use of the term <i><b>adversaries</b></i>
in any description of Mort. It is used exclusively to designate
the two partners opposed to the Mort and Vivant. In all
other cases where opposition is implied, the term <i><b>opponents</b></i>
must be used.</p>

<p>When necessary to distinguish the dealer from the first, second,
or third hand, it is usual to add the letters employed for that purpose
in whist; placing them inside the diagram of the table, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p134a.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Diagram of the position of the players at the table" />
</div>

<p>This diagram shows that Vivant dealt, and that the adversary
on the Right of Mort had the original lead.</p>

<p><i><b>With Three Players.</b></i> Vivant having selected his seat and
cards, the adversaries may select their seats. It is usual for the
strongest adversary to sit Right.</p>

<p><i><b>With Four Players</b></i>, we can best describe the arrangement
by numbering them 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, the lowest number,
1, having cut the lowest card, and the others having the right to
play Vivant in their numerical order. The initial arrangement
would be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/p134b.jpg" width="450" height="115" alt="Diagram of the position of the players at the table" />
</div>

<p>For the three succeeding games the arrangement would be:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/p134c.jpg" width="450" height="115" alt="Diagram of the position of the players at the table" />
</div>

<p>It will be seen that each player, immediately after being Vivant,
sits out, or takes Mort’s place, for the next game.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> It is usual for Vivant to deal the first hand for
himself, as the disadvantage of exposing fourteen cards is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
than compensated for in compelling the adversary to open the
game by leading up to an unknown hand. If Vivant deals the
first hand for Mort, he must present the pack to the player on
dummy’s right to be cut, and deal the cards from right to left,
turning up the trump at Mort’s place. If he deals for himself,
he presents the pack to the pone to be cut, and proceeds as in
whist.</p>

<p>When two packs are used, the French laws require that if the
deal is for Mort, the Right shall gather and shuffle the still pack;
and that if Vivant deals for himself, the pone shall gather and
shuffle. I have found this to be awkward, because the player who
is gathering and shuffling the cards of one pack is called upon to
cut the other. For this reason I recommend that whichever
adversary is the pone for the deal in hands should allow his partner
to gather and shuffle the still pack. When either adversary
deals, his partner will, of course, gather and shuffle the still pack.</p>

<p>The general rules with regard to irregularities in the deal are
the same as at whist, with the following exceptions:&mdash;</p>

<p>A misdeal does not lose the deal unless the opponents so elect;
they may prefer a new deal by the same dealer. The reason for
this is that the deal is a disadvantage, especially for Mort.</p>

<p>If Vivant or Mort offers the pack to one adversary to cut, and
then deals as if the other had cut, it is a misdeal; and it is not
admissible to shift the packets in order to remedy matters.</p>

<p>It might be imagined that a card exposed in dealing, if dealt to
Mort, would make no difference, as all his cards will presently be
exposed. But the laws give the opponents of the dealer the option
of either allowing the deal to stand, or having a new deal, or calling
it a misdeal.</p>

<p>According to the French laws, if there is any discussion in progress
with regard to the previous hand or play, the dealer may
lay aside the trump card, face down, until the discussion is finished.
If this law prevailed in America, I think the trump would
very seldom be turned immediately.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> In Mort the stake is a unit, so much a point. It
may assist players in regulating the value of the stake to remember
that six is the smallest number of points that can be won or
lost on a single game, and that thirty-seven is probably the highest,
although fifty, or even a hundred is not impossible. The average
is about twelve. The same customs as at whist prevail with regard
to outside betting.</p>

<p>The Vivant must pay or receive double, as he has to settle with
each adversary. If four play, the one sitting out has nothing to do
with the stakes; but he may make outside wagers on the result of
the game.</p>

<p><i><b>THE METHOD OF PLAYING</b></i> is practically the same
as at whist, with the following exceptions:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>When it is the turn of Mort to play, Vivant selects the card for
him.</p>

<p><i><b>The Revoke.</b></i> The rules governing this are the same as those
already given for English Dummy. Mort is not liable to penalty
under any circumstances. If any other player revokes, his opponents
may take three points from the score of his side; or add three
points to their score; or take three of his tricks. The penalty
cannot be divided; but if two or more revokes are made by the
same side, the penalty for each may be enforced in a different
manner. For instance: If the score is 3 to 2 in favor of the adversaries,
Vivant may take three points from their score for one revoke,
and add three to his own score for the other. It is not permissible
to reduce the revoking player’s <i><b>tricks</b></i> to nothing. At least
one must be left in order to prevent slams being made through
revoke penalties.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards Played in Error.</b></i> Vivant is not liable to any penalty
for dropping his cards face up on the table; but if he or Mort
plays two cards at once to a trick, the adversaries may select
which they will allow to be played. The adversaries are subject
to the same penalties as in whist for all cards played in error.</p>

<p><i><b>Leading Out of Turn.</b></i> If Vivant or Mort lead out of turn,
the adversaries may let the lead stand, or demand it be taken back.
If it was the turn of neither, no penalty can be enforced, and if
all have played to the trick, the error cannot be corrected.</p>

<p><i><b>Taking Tricks.</b></i> The methods of taking tricks, and placing
them so that they can be easily counted, have been fully described
in connection with whist.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECT OF THE GAME.</b></i> As in whist, the object is to
take tricks; the highest card played of the suit led wins, and
trumps win against all other suits. The first six tricks taken by one
side, and forming a <i><b>book</b></i>, do not count; but all above that number
count toward game. At the end of each hand, the side that has
taken any tricks in excess of the book scores them, their opponents
counting nothing. As soon as either side reaches five
points, they win the game, but the concluding hand must be
played out, and the winners are entitled to score all the points
over five that they can make on that hand. For instance: The
score is 4 to 3 in favor of Vivant and Mort. They win the first
seven tricks, which makes them game; but they do not cease
playing. If they succeed in gaining eleven tricks out of the thirteen,
they win a game of 9 points, instead of 5.</p>

<p>As already observed, Vivant loses or gains double the value of
the points in each hand. In the three-handed game this must be
so; but in my opinion it would be a great improvement in the
four-handed game to allow the player sitting out to share the
fortunes of the Vivant, as in Bridge, and in many German games
of cards, notably Skat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>SLAMS.</b></i> The two great differences between French and
English Dummy are that honours are not counted in Mort, and
that a special value is attached to slams. A slam is made when
one side takes the thirteen tricks. These must be actually won,
and cannot be partly made up of tricks taken in penalty for revokes.
Players cannot score a slam in a hand in which they have
revoked.</p>

<p>A slam counts 20 points to the side making it; but these 20
points have nothing to do with the game score. For instance:
The score is 4 all. Vivant and Mort make a slam. This does
not win the game; but the 20 points are debited and credited on
the score-sheet; the deal passes to the left, and the game proceeds
with the score still 4 all, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> The number of points won on each game are
put down on the score-sheet, each side being credited with the
number of points appearing on their markers when the game is
finished. To the winners’ score is added: 3 points, for a triple
game, if their opponents have not scored; 2 points, for a double
game, if their opponents are not half way, or 1 point, for a simple
game, if their opponents are 3 or 4. In addition to this, the winners
add 4 points, for bonus or consolation, in every instance.
From the total thus found must be deducted whatever points
have been scored by the losers, whether game points, slams, or
both. For instance: Vivant and Mort win a game with the score
8 to 2 in their favor, which is a double. This is put down on the
score sheets thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>8 + 2 for the double, + 4 consolation, = 14, minus 2 scored by
the opponents; making 12 the net value of the game. Vivant
therefore wins 24 points, and each of the adversaries, R and L, lose
12. Again:&mdash;</p>

<p>R and L win a simple with a score of 5 to 4, V and M having
made a slam. 5 + 1 for the simple, + 4 for consolation, = 10,
minus 4 points scored, and 20 for the slam = 24; showing that R
and L lose 14 points each, although they won the game.
Again:&mdash;</p>

<p>V and M win a triple, with a score of 8 to 0; R and L having
revoked. 8, + 3, + 4, + 3 for the revoke = 18, from which there
is nothing to deduct.</p>

<p>The greatest number of points that can be made on a game,
exclusive of slams and revokes, is 17; and the least number is 6.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKING.</b></i> The methods of using the counters in scoring
the game points have already been described in connection
with whist.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING OUT.</b></i> If there are more than four candidates
for play at the conclusion of a tournée, the selection of the new
table must be made as if no tournée had been played; all having
equal rights to cut in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>CHEATING.</b></i> Mort offers even less opportunity to the greek
than whist, as the deal is a disadvantage, and nothing is gained by
turning up an honour, beyond its possession.</p>

<h3>CAYENNE, OR CAYENNE WHIST.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Cayenne is played with two full packs of fifty-two
cards, which rank as at Whist, both for cutting and playing.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKERS</b></i> are necessary, and must be suitable for counting
to ten points. A sheet of paper is used for scoring the results of
the games.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Cayenne is played by four persons. When
there are more than four candidates for play the selection of the
table must be made as at Whist. Partners and deal are then cut for.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> One of the packs having been spread on the
table, face down, each of the four players draws a card; the two
lowest pairing against the two highest. The lowest of the four is
the dealer, and has the choice of seats and cards. Ties are decided
in the same manner as at Whist.</p>

<p><i><b>POSITION OF THE PLAYERS.</b></i> The partners sit
opposite each other, and the players are distinguished, as at Whist,
by the letters A-B and Y-Z. Z is the dealer, and A has the
original lead.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> One pack of cards is shuffled and cut as at
Whist. The dealer then gives four cards to each player, beginning
on his left; then four more, and finally five, no trump being
turned. In many places six cards are first dealt to each player,
and then seven; but the 4-4-5 system is better, and is the rule in
the very similar game of Boston.</p>

<p>The general rules with regard to irregularities in the deal are the
same as at Whist; except that a misdeal does not lose the deal.
The misdealer must deal again, and with the same pack.</p>

<p><i><b>CAYENNE.</b></i> After the cards are all dealt, the player to the
left of the dealer cuts the still pack, which is shuffled and presented
to him by the dealer’s partner, and the top card of the portion left
on the table is turned up for Cayenne. This card is not a trump,
but is simply to determine the rank of the suits.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> In Cayenne the stake is a unit, so much a point.
The largest number of points possible to win on a rubber is 24,
and the smallest, 1. The result of the rubber may be a tie, which
we consider a defect in any game. In settling at the end of the
rubber it is usual for the losers to pay their right-hand adversaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>MAKING THE TRUMP.</b></i> The trump suit must be
named by the dealer or his partner, after they have examined their
cards. The dealer has the first say, and he may either select
cayenne or any of the other suits; or he may announce <i><b>grand</b></i>,
playing for the tricks without any trump suit; or he may call <i><b>nullo</b></i>,
playing to take as few tricks as possible, without a trump suit. If
the dealer makes the choice, his partner must abide by it; but if he
has not a hand to justify him in deciding, he should leave the
selection to his partner, who must decide one way or the other.</p>

<p>The considerations which should guide players in their choice
are the scoring possibilities of their hands, in tricks and in honours.
As in Whist, the first six tricks taken by one side do not count;
but each trick above that number counts one, two, etc., <i><b>by cards</b></i>.
There are five honours in the trump suit in Cayenne; A K Q J 10;
and the partners holding the majority of them count 1 for each
honour that they hold in excess of their opponents, and 1 in addition,
for <i><b>honours</b></i>. For instance: If A-B have three honours
dealt them, they must have one more than their adversaries, and 1
for honours; entitling them to score 2. If they have four, they
have 3 in excess, and 1 for honours, a total of 4. If they have
five, they count 6 by honours.</p>

<p>At the end of the hand the points made by cards and by honours
are multiplied by the value of the trump suit. This value varies
according to the suit which is cayenne, which is always first preference.
If cayenne is also the trump suit the points made by
cards and honours are multiplied by 4. If the trump suit is the
same colour as cayenne, the multiplier is 3. If it is a different
colour the multiplier is 2 or 1, according to the suit. The rank of
the suits as multipliers will be readily understood from the following
table:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="How the scoring works">
  <tr>
    <td>If Cayenne is</td>
    <td>♡</td>

</table>

<p>Better to understand the importance of considering this variation
in value when making the trump, it should be noticed that
although the game is 10 points, several games may be won in a
single hand, as everything made is counted, and any points over
10 go to the credit of the second game. If more than 20 points
are made, the excess goes on the third game, and so on. Another
important point is the great value attached to honours, and the
maker of the trump should never forget that he can better afford
to risk his adversaries winning 2 by cards with a trump in which
he has three honours, than he can to risk a trump in which they
may have three honours, and he can probably win only the odd
trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>A further element may enter into his calculations, the state of
the score. Tricks count before honours, and if he feels certain of
making, by cards, the few points necessary to win the rubber, he
may entirely disregard the honours.</p>

<p>With such a hand it would be better to play without a trump,
and to announce a <i><b>grand</b></i>, in which there are neither trumps
nor honours, and every trick over the book is multiplied by 8.
Two by cards at grand is worth more than two by cards and two
by honours with any trump but cayenne.</p>

<p>There is still another resource, to announce <i><b>nullo</b></i>, in which there
is no trump, and the object of the players is to take as few tricks
as possible. In nullo, every trick over the book counts for the adversaries,
and is multiplied by 8. A peculiarity of nullo is that the
Ace of each suit ranks below the deuce, unless the player holding
it wishes to declare it higher than the King. In the latter case he
must announce it when he plays it, and before his left-hand adversary
plays to the trick.</p>

<p>If the dealer transfers the right of making the trump to his
partner, he must use the phrase, “You make it, partner.” If a
player makes the trump out of turn, his adversaries may consult
as to the propriety of demanding a new deal.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The trump suit, grand, or
nullo having been announced, the player on the dealer’s left begins
by leading any card he pleases, and the others must all
follow suit if they can. The penalty for a revoke is the loss of
three tricks; or the value of three tricks in points; or the addition
of a like amount to the adversaries’ score. The side making a revoke
cannot win the game that hand, no matter what they score;
but they may play the hand out, and count all they make to within
one point of game, or 9. Revoking players cannot count points
for slams.</p>

<p>The rules for cards played in error, leading out of turn, and all
such irregularities, are the same as in Whist. The last trick turned
and quitted may be seen.</p>

<p>The methods of gathering and stacking the tricks is the same
as at Whist.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> The chief object in Cayenne,
either with a trump or in a grand, is to take tricks; in a
nullo it is not to take them. In any case the highest card played
of the suit led wins the trick, and trumps, if any, win against all
other suits. At the end of each hand the side that wins any
tricks in excess of the book scores them, after multiplying their
number by the unit of value settled upon by the announcement.
If a nullo is played the adversaries score them. Honours are then
claimed; but the game cannot be won by honours alone, as at
Whist; those holding honours must stop at the score of 9, unless
they also win the odd trick. As soon as either side reaches or
passes 10 points, they win a game; but the hand must be played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
out, and all tricks taken must be counted. If one side goes out by
cards, the other cannot score honours. Thirteen tricks taken by
one side is called a <i><b>slam</b></i>, and it counts 6 points. Twelve tricks is
a <i><b>little slam</b></i>, and it counts 4. Either of these must be made
exclusive of revoke penalties.</p>

<p><i><b>RUBBERS.</b></i> The rubber is won by the side that first wins
four games of ten points each; and the winning side adds 8 points
to its score.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> The game score should be kept on a whist marker,
using the four large keys on one side for single points, and the
single large key on the opposite side for five points. The three
small keys are used to show how many games of the rubber have
been won by that side.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Two Games Won, and 2 Points Scored on the Third.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The method of using counters for scoring 10-point games has
already been described in connection with Whist.</p>

<p>In addition to either markers or counters, there must be a sheet
of paper to keep the final results of the games.</p>

<p>In scoring, the revoke penalty counts first, tricks next, and
honours last.</p>

<p>The side first reaching 10 points wins a <i><b>quadruple</b></i>, or game
of 4, if their adversaries have not scored; a <i><b>triple</b></i>, or game of 3,
if their adversaries have not reached 4; a <i><b>double</b></i>, or game of 2,
if the adversaries have not reached 7; and a <i><b>single</b></i>, or game of
1, if their adversaries are 8 or 9 up. These game points are put
down on the score-sheet, and all the points on the <i><b>adversaries’</b></i>
marker are then turned down. If the winners make any points in
excess of 10, such points are left to their credit on the marker,
and count toward the next game. For instance: The score is
A-B, 6; and Y-Z, 8; shown on the markers thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 580px;">
<img src="images/p141b.jpg" width="580" height="125" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap spacer">A-B 6 Points.</span> <span class="smcap spacer">Y-Z 8 Points.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us suppose that Z announces cayenne, and makes 2 by
cards; A-B claiming two by honours. Y-Z multiply by 4, making
them 8, and bringing their total score on the marker to 16;
that is, a game, and 6 points to their credit on the second game.
This must now be put down on the score-sheet. A-B’s honours
not counting, as Y-Z went out by cards, the game is a double;
A-B not having reached 7 points. The score and markers now
stand:&mdash;</p>

Y-Z is found to be 15, after deducting the 10 points made by
A-B.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING IN.</b></i> If there are more than four persons belonging
to the table, those waiting cut in, as at Whist.</p>

<p><i><b>METHODS OF CHEATING.</b></i> In all games in which the
cards are dealt in bulk, four or six at a time, there is more or less
temptation for the greek to gather desirable cards in the pack,
leaving them undisturbed in the shuffle. If he can pick up two
tricks of the previous deal with eight good cards of the same suit
in them, by placing any two tricks of other cards between them,
and dealing six at a time, he can tell exactly how many of the
eight located cards are in his partner’s hand. For this reason a
player who does not thoroughly shuffle the cards should be carefully
watched; and an immediate protest should be made against
any disarrangement of the tricks as they are taken in during the
play, such as placing the last trick taken under the first. If the
player doing this is to be the next dealer, any one observing the
movement should insist upon his right to shuffle the cards
thoroughly; if not to leave the game.</p>

<p>We are strongly opposed to dealing the cards in bulk at
Cayenne, and see no reason why the methods that prevail in the
very similar game of Bridge should not be adopted.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> There is little
to add to the rules already given for Whist. The principles that
should guide in the making of the trump have been given in connection
with the more important game of Bridge; and the suggestions
for playing nullo will be fully discussed in the games in
which it is a prominent characteristic: Solo Whist, and Boston.
Grand is practically Whist after the trumps are exhausted.</p>

<h3>SOLO WHIST, OR WHIST DE GAND.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Solo Whist is played with a full pack of fifty-two
cards, which rank as at Whist, both for cutting and playing. Two
packs are generally used, the one being shuffled while the other is
dealt.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKERS</b></i> are not used in Solo Whist, every hand being a
complete game in itself, which is immediately settled for in
counters representing money. At the beginning of the game each
player should be provided with an equal number of these counters.
They are usually white and red, the red being worth five times as
much as the white. Twenty white and sixteen red is the usual
allotment to each player when the game begins. Some one
player should be the banker, to sell and redeem all counters.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Solo Whist is played by four persons. If there
are five candidates for play, they all sit at the same table, each
taking his turn to sit out for one hand while the four others play.
The dealer is usually selected to sit out. If there are only three
players, one suit must be deleted from the pack, or the 2, 3, and 4
of each suit must be thrown out.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> The table being formed, the players draw from
an outspread for the deal, and choice of seats and cards. The
player drawing the lowest card deals the first hand, and it is
usual for him to dictate to the other players what seats they shall
occupy with relation to himself. Ties are decided in the same
manner as at Whist.</p>

<p><i><b>POSITION OF THE PLAYERS.</b></i> The four players at
Solo Whist are usually distinguished by the letters A B Y Z.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p144.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Diagram of the position of the players at the table" />
</div>

<p>Z is the dealer, and A is known as the <i><b>eldest hand</b></i>. The
position of the players does not imply any partnership; for, as we
shall see presently, any player may have any one of the others for
a partner, without any change taking place in their positions at
the table.</p>

<p>The players having once taken their seats are not allowed to
change them without the consent of all the others at the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> The cards having been properly shuffled, are
presented to the pone to be cut. Beginning on his left, the dealer
distributes the cards three at a time, until only four remain. These
he deals one at a time, turning up the last for the trump. When
two packs are used, the player sitting opposite the dealer shuffles
the still pack while the other is dealt. The deal passes in regular
rotation to the left.</p>

<p>When three play with a pack of forty cards, the last card is
turned up for trumps, but it does not belong to the dealer, and is
not used in play.</p>

<p>The general rules with regard to irregularities in the deal are
the same as at Whist; except that a misdeal does not pass the
deal. The misdealer must deal again, and with the same pack.</p>

<p>The cards dealt, each player sorts and counts his hand to see that
he has the correct number of cards, thirteen. If not, he should
immediately claim a misdeal; for a player having more or less
than his right proportion of cards cannot win anything on that
hand, but will have to stand his proportion of all losses incurred
by him or his side.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> There are seven distinct
objects in the Solo Whist, and before play begins each player has
an opportunity of declaring to which of these objects he proposes
to attain. They are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. To win 8 of the 13 tricks, with the assistance of a partner.
This is called a <i><b>Proposal</b></i>; the partner’s share is an <i><b>Acceptance</b></i>.</p>

<p>2nd. To win 5 of the 13 tricks, against the three other players
combined. This is called a <i><b>Solo</b></i>.</p>

<p>3rd. To take no tricks, there being no trump suit, and the three
other players being opposed. This is called <i><b>Misère</b></i>, or Nullo.</p>

<p>4th. To win 9 of the 13 tricks against the three other players
combined; the single player to name the trump suit. This is
called <i><b>Abundance</b></i>.</p>

<p>5th. To win 9 of the 13 tricks against the three other players
combined, with the trump suit that is turned up. This is called
<i><b>Abundance in Trumps</b></i>.</p>

<p>6th. To take no tricks, there being no trump suit, and the three
other players being opposed; the single player’s cards being exposed
face up on the table after the first trick is complete. This
is called Misère sur table, or <i><b>A Spread</b></i>.</p>

<p>7th. To win all 13 tricks against the three other players combined;
the single player to name the trump suit, and to have the
original lead whether eldest hand or not. This is called Abundance
Déclarée, or <i><b>A Slam</b></i>.</p>

<p>While the object of the proposing player is to win or lose the
declared number of tricks, that of his adversaries is to prevent him
from doing so, if possible. There are no honours, and the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
factor in the count is the number of tricks actually taken. The
highest card played of the suit led wins the trick, and trumps, if
any, win against all other suits.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF DECLARING.</b></i> The eldest hand has the
first say, and after examining his cards he may make any of the
several propositions just enumerated. The smallest proposal he
can make is to take 8 tricks with the assistance of a partner. To
do this he should have four reasonably sure tricks in his own hand.
Some players say he should be strong in trumps; while others
claim that the eldest hand should propose only on general strength.
The former is the better plan. No other player should propose on
trumps alone. This announcement is made by saying “<i><b>I propose</b></i>.”
If a player thinks he can take five tricks against the combined
efforts of the three other players, he announces: “<i><b>Solo</b></i>.”
If he feels equal to a misère, he calls: “<i><b>Misère</b></i>;” and so on,
according to the strength of his hand. If he does not feel justified
in making a call, he says “<i><b>I pass</b></i>;” and the next player on
his left has the opportunity; and so on, until some player has proposed
to do something, or all have passed.</p>

<p>If any player has proposed for a partner, any of the others, in
their proper turn, may accept him by simply saying “<i><b>I accept</b></i>.”
By so doing, a player intimates that he has four probable tricks
also, but in the plain suits, and that he is willing to try for eight
tricks with the proposer for a partner. All the other calls are
made by a single player with the intention of playing against the
three others. Any player except the eldest hand having once
said, “I pass,” cannot afterwards make or accept any proposal.
The eldest hand, after passing once, can accept a proposal, but he
cannot make one.</p>

<p>It is the custom in some places, when no one will make a proposal
of any sort, to turn down the trump, and play the hands
without any trump suit, each man for himself, the winner of the
last trick losing to each of the others the value of a solo. This is
called a <i><b>Grand</b></i>.</p>

<p><i><b>RANK OF THE PROPOSALS.</b></i> The various calls
outrank one another in the order in which we have given them. If
one player says, “I propose,” and another calls “Solo,” the solo
call shuts out the proposal, even though it has been accepted by a
second player. The call of a misère would in turn shut out a solo;
abundance would take precedence of misère; and abundance in
trumps would be a better call than simple abundance. The slam
of course outranks all other bids. This making of a better
proposition than one already made is known as “<i><b>Over-calling</b></i>.”</p>

<p>A player who has made a call of any kind, or has accepted a
proposal, may amend his proposition to a better one, only in case
he is over-called; or a player who can not get a partner to accept
him may amend his call to solo. For instance: A player may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
have a hand which he feels sure is good for 8 tricks, perhaps 9.
To be safe, he calls solo, and hopes to make three or four over-tricks.
If he is outbid by some player over-calling him with a
misère, he may be tempted to amend his call to abundance.</p>

<p>No call is good until every player who has not already passed
does so, by saying distinctly, “I pass.”</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> The losses and gains of the players are in proportion
to the difficulties of the tasks they set themselves.</p>

<p>The most popular method of settling is to pay or take red
counters for the various calls, and white counters for the tricks
under or over the exact number proposed. If the callers succeed
in their undertakings, their adversaries pay them; if they fail, they
pay their adversaries. A red counter is worth five white ones.</p>

<table summary="How to settle up">
  <tr>
    <td>Proposal and Acceptance wins or loses</td>
    <td>1 red counter.</td>

    <td>Solo wins or loses</td>

<p>In Proposal and Acceptance, each of the partners pays one of
his adversaries. In all cases in which a single player is opposed
to the three others, he wins or loses the amount shown in the
foregoing table with each of them individually; so that a single
player calling a solo would win or lose 6 red counters. If he lost
it, making only four tricks, he would also have to pay to each of
his three adversaries a white counter. If he won it, making seven
tricks, each of them would have to pay him two red and two white
counters.</p>

<p>Misères, Spreads, and Slams pay no odd tricks. The moment a
Misère player takes a trick, or a Slam player loses one, the hands
are abandoned, and the stakes paid.</p>

<p>The usual value attached to the counters in America is 25 cents
for the red, and 5 cents for the white. In England the proportion
is sixpence and a penny.</p>

<p><i><b>POOL SOLO.</b></i> When players wish to enhance the gambling
attractions of the game, a pool is introduced. For this purpose
a receptacle is placed upon the table, in which each player
puts a red counter at the beginning of the game. Any person
playing alone against the three others, wins this pool if he is successful;
if he fails, he must double the amount it contains, besides
paying each of his adversaries in the regular way. In some
places it is the custom for each player to contribute a red counter
when he deals. The proposals and acceptances do not touch the
pool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> If a proposal is accepted, and
no one over-calls it, the proposer and acceptor are partners; but
make no change in their positions at the table. The eldest hand,
sitting to the left of the dealer, begins by leading any card he
pleases, and the play proceeds exactly as at Whist, the tricks being
so stacked that they may be readily counted at any time.</p>

<p>If a single player has called solo, misère, or abundance, the eldest
hand still has the original lead, and there is no change in the
positions of the players. The position of the lead is often a serious
consideration with a player calling a solo or a misère.</p>

<p>In all calls except misères and slams, the hands must be played
out, in order to give each side an opportunity to make all the over-tricks
they can. The moment a misère player takes a trick, or a
slam player loses one, the hands are thrown up, and the stakes
paid.</p>

<p>When a spread is called, the trump is taken up, and the eldest
hand leads. As soon as all have played to the first trick, the
caller spreads his remaining twelve cards face upward on the
table, so that each of his adversaries may see them; but they have
no control of the order in which they shall be played. The adversaries
play their hands in the usual manner, with no further guidance
than that possible by inference from the play and the exposed hand.
The caller plays according to his best judgment.</p>

<p>When a slam is called, the player proposing it has the original
lead; but that does not alter the position of the deal for the next
hand.</p>

<p><i><b>REVOKES.</b></i> A revoke is a serious matter in Solo Whist.
The penalty for it is the loss of three tricks, and the revoking
players must pay the <i><b>red</b></i> counters involved in the call whether
they win or lose; but they may play the hand out to save over-tricks.
For instance: A proposer and acceptor make 11 tricks;
their adversaries having claimed a revoke. After deducting the
revoke penalty, 3 tricks, the callers still have 8 tricks left, enough
to make good the call. They each lose a red counter; but no
white ones, having saved their over-tricks. Had they taken only
8 tricks altogether, the penalty for the revoke would have left
them only 5, and they would each have had to pay one red and
three whites. If either adversary of the callers revokes, the individual
player in fault must pay for all the consequences of the error.
If the player in fault can show that the callers would have won in
spite of the revoke, his partners must pay their share; but the revoking
player must settle for the three tricks lost by the revoke.
For instance: Z calls solo; A revokes; Z makes 6 tricks, which it
can be shown he must have done in spite of the revoke. A, Y,
and B each pay Z 1 red and 1 white counter, and then A pays Z
9 white counters in addition for the tricks taken as revoke penalty.</p>

<p>If the single player revokes, either on solo or abundance, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
loses the red counters involved, and must pay whatever white
counters are due after three of his tricks have been added to those
of the adversaries as penalty for the revoke. For instance: A
calls solo, and revokes, but wins 6 tricks in all. He pays two red
counters to each adversary. They then take three of his tricks,
leaving him three only, and demand two white counters each, for
the two under-tricks. If a player revokes who has called a misère
or a slam, he immediately loses the stakes. If a revoke is
made by any adversary of a player who has called misère or slam,
the player in fault must individually pay all the stakes.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS PLAYED IN ERROR.</b></i> In the simple proposal
and acceptance, the rules with regard to cards played in
error, or led out of turn, are the same as at Whist. In the case
of a single player against three adversaries, the caller is not liable
to any penalty for cards played in error, or led out of turn; but
his adversaries are subject to the usual whist penalties for all such
irregularities, such as having the cards laid on the table as exposed,
or a suit called, or the highest or lowest of a suit led demanded
from an adversary who has followed suit out of turn.</p>

<p>For the better protection of the single player, who is much more
liable to be injured by irregularities than partners would be, he is
allowed to prevent the use of an exposed trump for ruffing, and to
demand or <i><b>to prevent</b></i> the play of any exposed card in plain suits.
If a suit is led of which an adversary has an exposed card on the
table the single player may call upon him to play his highest or
lowest of that suit.</p>

<p>If any adversary of a misère player leads out of turn, or exposes
a card, or plays before his proper turn in any trick, the caller may
immediately claim the stakes, and the individual player in fault
must pay for himself, and for his partners.</p>

<p><i><b>METHODS OF CHEATING.</b></i> While the practice of
dealing three cards at a time gives a little more opportunity to the
greek than would occur if they were dealt as at Whist, there is little
to be feared if two packs are used, unless two greeks are in partnership.
When such partners sit next each other, there is more
or less danger, if only one pack is used, that one may shuffle so
that the other may cut understandingly; or that a good shuffler
may run up six cards for a dealer that is not embarrassed by the
cards being cut. A shrewd greek can often help a silent partner
who is playing under the disguise of a single caller, especially in
misère. Persons who play in the many public cafés of Europe
should be especially careful to avoid this style of partnership,
where it is very common.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> Apart from
the general principles common to all forms of Whist, such
as the play of high or low cards, trumps or plain suits, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
there are several points peculiar to Solo Whist which require
attention.</p>

<p><i><b>Proposing.</b></i> It is better to propose on two or three sure
tricks, with strong probabilities of several more, than on a certainty
of four only. For instance: The two highest trumps and
two suits containing Aces, with no other trick probable, is not
such a good hand for a proposal as one containing four average
trumps, with one plain suit of K Q J x x, and another of K Q x x.
It is not improbable that the latter may be good for seven or eight
tricks. Nothing but experience will teach a player what combinations
of cards are “probably” good for tricks; but K x x, or Q J
10 x or K Q, may be counted on.</p>

<p>There should be some intelligible system of proposing, so that
the players may understand each other. The eldest hand should
not propose except on strong trumps, and this should be a warning
to other players not to accept him on trump strength alone.</p>

<p>Four trumps with two or three honours may be called strong;
or five trumps, even without an honour. Five trumps with two
or more honours is great strength.</p>

<p>Any player other than the eldest hand should propose on
general strength and the player accepting him should do so on
trump strength. Some such distinction should be clearly understood,
in order that there may be no such contretemps as two
players proposing and accepting on trumps alone and finding
themselves without a trick in the plain suits after the trumps are
drawn.</p>

<p>If the eldest hand is strong in trumps, but has not four sure
tricks, he should pass, which will give him an excellent opportunity
to accept a player proposing on general strength in the plain
suits. If the proposal should be accepted before it comes to his
turn, the eldest hand should be in a good position to defeat it.</p>

<p>If any player, other than the eldest hand, has sufficient trump
strength to justify a proposal, he will usually find that he can risk
a solo; or by passing, defeat any proposal and acceptance that
may be made.</p>

<p><i><b>Accepting.</b></i> A proposal by the eldest hand should not be
accepted by a player with only one strong suit. The probability
of tricks in several suits is better than a certainty in one suit; but
if one strong suit is accompanied by a card of re-entry, or by four
trumps, it should prove very strong, particularly in partnership
with the eldest hand.</p>

<p>When the partners will sit next each other, proposals may be
accepted on slightly weaker hands than would be considered safe
otherwise.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing Proposals and Acceptances.</b></i> If the eldest hand
has proposed, and his partner sits next him on the left, the commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
trumps should be first led, in order to secure as many
rounds as possible. If the eldest hand has no high-card combination
in trumps, it is sometimes better to lead a small card from a
weak suit, hoping to put the partner in. If successful, the partner
will first show his suit, and then lead trumps through the
adversaries. If the acceptor sits on the right of the proposing
eldest hand, trumps should be led immediately, and the highest of
them first, no matter what they are. The Q or J at the head of
five trumps may be of great use to a partner with an honour. When
the eldest hand has proposed, and his partner sits opposite him,
trumps should be led at once, and all combinations played as at
Whist.</p>

<p>The foregoing principles equally apply when the eldest hand
has accepted a proposal, if the player can be depended on to have
proposed on general strength.</p>

<p>When partners sit opposite each other, the general principles of
leading, establishing, defending, and bringing in suits, are the
same as at Whist, and the usual trump signals and echoes are
made use of. The game is practically Whist, with the additional
knowledge that both proposer and acceptor have strong hands.</p>

<p>When partners sit next each other, there are many opportunities
for leading strengthening cards through the adversaries,
especially in the partner’s known or inferred strong suit.</p>

<p><i><b>Finesse.</b></i> If neither proposer nor acceptor is the eldest hand,
they should make no finesses; but get into the lead as soon as
possible, and exhaust the trumps. The greatest danger of defeat
for a proposal and acceptance is that the adversaries, with the
original lead, may establish a cross-ruff, or get six tricks with
their winning cards before the calling players get a lead.</p>

<p>It is a common artifice for the proposer and acceptor, after they
have exhausted the adversaries’ trumps, each to show a strong suit
by leading it once, and then to lead the highest card of a weaker
suit; thus offering each other chances for successful finesse.</p>

<p>If a partner sitting on the right leads a suit, there should be no
finesse; and in general, finessing should be avoided until the
declaration is assured. It may then be used to secure probable
over-tricks.</p>

<p><i><b>Adversaries’ Play.</b></i> The players opposed to the call are always
designated as the adversaries.</p>

<p>Players opposed to a proposer and acceptor should make no
finesses that they are not certain will win more tricks if successful
than they will lose if they fail. If the adversaries sit together, and
are the last to play on any trick, the third hand should not trust
anything to his partner that he can attend to himself, unless he is
very anxious to be the last player on the next trick.</p>

<p>When the adversaries sit opposite each other, their play will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
differ very little from that in Whist, except that they will make
no efforts to establish long suits, and will not lead small cards from
combinations containing an Ace. Every trick possible should be
made sure of at once, before the calling players get any chance to
discard. Weak suits should be protected, as they are in Whist
when opposed to strong hands.</p>

<p>If an adversary has the first lead, it is usually best for him to
make what winning cards he has at once, unless he is pretty sure
that the proposal will be defeated.</p>

<p>It is very seldom right for the adversaries to lead trumps.
Some exceptions will naturally present themselves, such as an eldest
hand leading to his partner’s turned-up King. In the middle
or end game, it may be advantageous to bring down the caller’s
trumps together, or to draw two for one.</p>

<p>If an adversary finds himself with a pretty strong hand, he
should utterly disregard his partner, and play as false as he can;
for if the callers have eight probable tricks between them, it is impossible
for the fourth player to have anything, unless there has
been some mistake in the call.</p>

<p><i><b>In General.</b></i> There are one or two exceptions to the methods
of playing sequences at Whist, dependent on the position of the
players holding them. For instance: If first or second hand holds
any sequence of high cards, he should play the highest if his
partner sits next him on the left, and the adversaries are to play
after him; otherwise the partner might think the higher cards
of the sequence were against the leader. If a caller should hold
K Q x second hand, and play the Q as at Whist, his partner following
him, and holding Ace, would have to play it, thinking the
King might be beyond.</p>

<p><i><b>SOLO.</b></i> In speaking of the players in a solo, misère, or abundance,
it is usual to distinguish those opposed to the single player
by calling them respectively, Left, Right, and Opposite.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p152.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Diagram of the position of the players at the table" />
</div>

<p>This arrangement does not affect the use of the letters A Y B Z,
and the terms first, second, third, and fourth hand; indicating the
position of the deal, and of the lead.</p>

<p><i><b>Calling.</b></i> Those solos are easiest which are declared by the
eldest hand, or by the dealer; the hardest being those called by
second hand. The safest solos are those called on trump strength;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
but average trumps and winning cards in the plain suits are more
advantageous if the caller is not eldest hand. To call a solo on
plain suits alone, with only one or two trumps, is extremely dangerous;
and a solo called on a single suit must have at least five
or six good trumps in order to succeed.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYING.</b></i> When a call has been made entirely upon
trump strength, it is much better to make tricks by ruffing, than by
leading trumps. There is little use for a solo player to hold a
tenace in trumps, hoping it will be led to him. If he has good
suits, he should make sure of two rounds of trumps by leading the
Ace.</p>

<p>When the solo player is depending on the plain suits for tricks,
and has one long suit, he should make what winning cards he has
in the other plain suits in preference to leading trumps, for his
only danger is that his long suit will be led often enough to give
his adversaries discards in the other suits.</p>

<p>If a proposal was made before the solo was called, it is better
for the solo player to sit on the left of the player that proposed.</p>

<p>The caller should never play single honours second hand, unless
he has only one small card of the suit, or the honour is the Ace.</p>

<p>With A Q x, second or third hand, the Q must be finessed if
the caller has counted on both A and Q for tricks. If he can
probably win without the finesse, he should play Ace. If he has
tricks enough to win without either A or Q, he should play neither
of them.</p>

<p>A solo player should be very sure of his call before finessing for
over-tricks.</p>

<p><i><b>Adversaries’ Play.</b></i> The player to the left of the caller
should not lead trumps; but if the solo player has had a lead, and
has not led trumps himself, the player on his right should take the
first opportunity to lead them through him.</p>

<p>The player to the left of the caller should not lead from suits
headed only by the King; nor from those containing major or
minor tenaces. The best leads are from suits headed by Q J or
10, even if short.</p>

<p>With such high-card combinations as can be used to force the
command in one round, such as K Q, or K Q J, the regular whist
leads should be used. With suits headed by winning sequences,
held by the player on the left, it is often right to lead them once, in
order to show them, and then to lead a weaker suit to get rid of
the lead. It is sometimes better to play winning sequences as
long as it seems probable that the caller can follow suit.</p>

<p>Many persons use the Albany lead to indicate a wish for trumps
to be led through the caller. In response to such a signal the
best trump should be led, whatever it is.</p>

<p>When the adversary who leads in any trick is not on the left of
the solo player, the caller will, of course, not be the last player, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
at least one adversary must play after him. In such cases it is
best to lead the longest suits.</p>

<p><i><b>MISÈRE.</b></i> The great difficulty in Misère is not in playing it;
but in judging what hands justify such an undertaking.</p>

<p><i><b>Calling.</b></i> As a general proposition it may be stated that misère
should not be called with a long suit not containing the deuce.
But the longer the suit the less the danger there is for a player
who is determined to risk it; because the deuce is more likely to
be found alone in some adversary’s hand. Short suits may be
risked, even with no card smaller than a 5 or 6, and it is of course
a great advantage to have a suit altogether missing.</p>

<p><i><b>Leading.</b></i> The lead is a disadvantage to the caller, because
he must begin with a small card, and the adversaries can play
their highest. The only satisfaction to the caller is that he can
usually locate the high cards of the suit under such circumstances.
For instance: Suppose he originally leads a 4; second hand playing
the 9; third hand the Ace; and fourth hand the 10. The
third hand is marked with whatever cards of the sequence K Q J
are not in the caller’s hand.</p>

<p>Many players fall into the error of leading the highest card of a
losing sequence, such as a 6 from 6 5 4 3. This accomplishes
nothing, and only discloses to the adversaries the fact that the
caller is safe in that suit. The three is the better lead.</p>

<p><i><b>Following Suit.</b></i> The caller should usually play a card as
little inferior as he can to the highest already on the trick. When
he has cards of equal value, such as the 5 and 2, the 3 and 4 being
already on the table, he should play the lower card of the fourchette;
for although it may be said that the fourth player must
take the trick, there is no certainty that he will follow suit.</p>

<p>When second hand, if there is a choice between two cards, such
as the 6 and 2, an intermediate card having been led, it is often a
nice point to decide whether or not to risk covering and keeping
the deuce. If the deuce is played, it must be remembered that the
adversaries will follow with their highest cards, leaving two cards
out against the caller, both smaller than the 6.</p>

<p><i><b>Discarding.</b></i> The misère player should never discard from
his long suits. The high cards of short suits, and single intermediate
cards, such as 5’s and 6’s, should be got rid of at every
opportunity.</p>

<p><i><b>Adversaries of the Misère.</b></i> In playing against a misère
the chief difficulty is to prevent the caller from discarding, and to
place the lead with the player who can probably do him the most
harm.</p>

<p>It is an axiom with solo-whist players that every misère can be
defeated, if the weak spot in it can be found; because if the misère<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
was absolutely safe, it would be played as a spread, which would
pay the caller twice as much. This is not true, however, for it
often happens that the cards are so distributed in the other hands
that the call cannot be defeated, however risky it may have been.</p>

<p>The weak point in a misère is usually a short suit with one high
card in it; or a suit of intermediate length, without the deuce.</p>

<p>As it is probable that the caller is short in suits in which the
adversaries are long, and long in those in which they are short, he
is less likely to get a discard if they lead their shortest suits first.
If the misère player has over-called a proposal or a solo, he is likely
to be short in the trump suit, or at least safe in it. It is not good
play to lead a single Ace; but a King may be very effective; for if
no one plays the Ace on it, that card may be absolutely marked in
the caller’s hand. In such a case the adversary with the greatest
number of that suit should keep it for the attack. If this player
can get into the lead, he is not only sure of preventing the caller
from discarding, but of allowing the other adversaries to discard
to advantage.</p>

<p>With an honour and one small card, a player on the left should
lead the small card first; if on the right, the honour should be led
first. A long suit containing the deuce should be avoided as long
as possible.</p>

<p>The caller’s cards may sometimes be inferred if there has been
a previous call on the hand. For instance: A misère may be a
forced call; that is, the player first called a proposal, and not being
accepted, was forced to amend his call, choosing misère in preference
to solo. This would indicate a long weak suit of trumps. If
the dealer calls misère, the turn-up trump should be carefully
noted.</p>

<p>It is useless to persevere in suits in which the caller is evidently
safe. If he plays a very low card to a trick in which there is
already a high card, that suit should be stopped.</p>

<p><i><b>Discarding.</b></i> An adversary should get rid of some one suit, if
possible; for when that suit is afterwards led he will have free
choice of his discards in the other suits. Short suits should be
discarded in preference to high cards in long suits, unless the
cards in the short suit are very low. Discards give great information
to the adversaries if the rule is followed to discard the highest
of a suit; because all cards higher than those discarded must
be between the two other adversaries and the caller, and each adversary
is thus furnished with a guide. It is useless to discard a
suit of which the caller is void; and it is best to keep discarding
from one suit until it is exhausted, or only the deuce remains.
The trump signal is frequently used in discarding to indicate that
the signaller wishes to get into the lead.</p>

<p><i><b>Returning Suits.</b></i> Whether or not to return a partner’s lead
may often be decided by inferences from the fall of the cards. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
is frequently an easy matter to locate the cards in the various suits,
if it is borne in mind that adversaries who play after the caller get
rid of their highest cards. For instance: Right leads the 9;
caller plays the 5; left the 10; and the last player finds he holds
K Q J 6 of the suit. He should know that the caller has nothing
between the 5 and the 9, and must have the Ace; so his cards
were probably A 5 4 3 2. While it is manifestly impossible to
catch him on that suit, it may still be led three times, in order to
give the partners discards, as both of them must be short. If
this estimate of the caller’s cards is wrong in anything, it is not
with regard to the Ace, so there is not the slightest danger in
continuing the suit.</p>

<p>As a general rule, the suit first led by an adversary should be
returned, unless the player winning the trick has a singleton in
another suit, when he should lead that.</p>

<p>The suit led by the caller, if he was eldest hand, should not be
returned.</p>

<p>Some judgment of character must be used in playing on a caller’s
own lead. An adventurous player will sometimes call a misère
on a hand which contains a singleton 5 or 6, and will lead it at
once; trusting that second hand will imagine it to be safe, and
cover it. Players should be aware of this trap, and never cover a
misère player’s own lead if they can help it, unless the card led is
below a 4.</p>

<p><i><b>ABUNDANCE.</b></i> Very few persons will risk calling an
abundance which they are not pretty certain of; but a player may
be forced to the call on a doubtful hand, especially if he is over-called
on his original proposal to play a solo. The lead is a great advantage,
because trumps can be exhausted immediately, and the
suits protected. If the caller has not the lead he must calculate in
advance for trumping in, and if his plain suits are not quite established,
he will require more trumps than would otherwise be
necessary. The greatest danger to an abundance player who has
not the original lead, is that his best suit will be led through him,
and trumped, either on the first or second round. The caller is
often trapped into unnecessarily high trumping when suits are
led through him a second or third time.</p>

<p><i><b>The Adversaries</b></i> have little chance to defeat an abundance
unless they can over-trump the caller, or ruff his good cards before
he can exhaust the trumps. It is best for the Right to lead his
longest suit, and for the Left to lead his shortest. A guarded
King suit should not be led under any circumstances; nor a short
suit Ace high. If an adversary has a single trump of medium
size, such as a J or 10, it is often good play to trump a partner’s
winning cards, so as to be sure of preventing the caller from making
a small trump. If an adversary has trumped or over-trumped, it
is very important to lead that suit to him again as soon as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The rules for discarding that are given in connection with Whist
should be carefully observed; especially in the matter of showing
command of suits.</p>

<p><i><b>SPREADS.</b></i> These should not be called except with hands
in which every suit contains the deuce, and all the cards are low
enough to insure the player that nothing short of extraordinary
circumstances will defeat him. Open sequences, or Dutch
straights, as they are sometimes called, in which the cards are
all odd or all even, such as 2 4 6 8 10, are quite as safe as
ordinary sequences, provided the deuce is among the cards.</p>

<p>The player calling a spread must remember that it will be
impossible for him to get any discards after the first trick without
the consent of the adversaries; for they will not lead a suit of
which they see he is void. In order to reduce the caller’s chances
of a discard on the opening lead, before his cards are exposed, the
adversaries should select their shortest suits, unless they have a
bottom sequence to the deuce.</p>

<p><i><b>THE SLAM.</b></i> This feature of Solo Whist is even rarer than
the <i>grand coup</i> at Whist. It is not very marvellous for an
abundance player to make twelve or thirteen tricks; but to
announce thirteen tricks before a card is played is something
phenomenal. All the adversaries can do against such a call is to
show each other, by their discards, in which of the suits they have a
possible trick. It is very annoying to have a player succeed in making
a slam just because two of his adversaries keep the same suit.</p>

<h4>SOLO WHIST FOR THREE PLAYERS.</h4>

<p>The best arrangement is to play with a pack of forty cards, deleting
the 2, 3, and 4 of each suit. The last card is turned up to
determine the trump, but it is not used in play.</p>

<p>There is no proposal and acceptance, solo being the lowest call.
If all three players pass, the trump card is turned down, and each
player in turn has the option of calling a six-trick abundance,
naming his own trump suit. In some places it is the custom to
allow the players to over-call each other, after the trump is turned
down, each increasing the number of tricks he proposes to take.
A misère over-calls eight tricks.</p>

<p><i><b>Kimberly Solo</b></i> is for four players, without any proposal and
acceptance, solo being the lowest call. If all pass, a six-trick solo
with a different trump is allowed.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Solo player wins.</i> <i>Misère player loses.</i></p>

<p>In the first example, A and Y pass, and B calls Solo. A follows
the modern practice of leading the top of his long weak suit, as a
card of warning and support for his partners. Z knows Y must
have 9 or Ace of diamonds, or no more, and he avoids the error of
opening another suit, especially a weak one. B continues with
the trump Queen, hoping to drop King and Jack together. At
trick 5, Z cannot give up the command of trumps, and as A’s lead
and discard indicate that he wants spades led up to him, Z’s best
chance is that Y has some clubs. Y leads to A. At trick 9, Z
knows B cannot have 10 and 9 of trumps, or he would have led
one of them to prevent the J and 8 both making, so Y must have
one of those trumps. At trick 11, if B leads the club, he loses his
call. He must again take the chance of bringing the trumps
down together.</p>

<p>In the second example A proposes, or calls Solo, and Y over-calls
him with Misère. The great point in playing against Misère
is to continue leading suits in which he is known to be long, so as
to give your partners discards. This B does with the two long
spades, the caller being marked with the ace and others on the
second trick. Then Z allows B to discard his high diamonds
on the clubs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<h3>SCOTCH WHIST, OR CATCH THE TEN.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Scotch Whist is played with a pack of 36 cards,
which rank in plain suits, A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6; the Ace being
highest both in play and in cutting. In the trump suit the Jack is
the best card, the order being, J A K Q 10 9 8 7 6.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKERS.</b></i> There are no suitable counters for Scotch
Whist, and the score is usually kept on a sheet of paper.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Any number from two to eight may play.
When there are five or seven players, the spade 6 must be removed
from the pack. In some places this is not done; the
thirty-fifth card being turned up for the trump, the thirty-sixth
shown to the table, and then laid aside.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> Whatever the number of persons offering for
play, the table is formed by cutting from the outspread pack for
partners, seats, and deal.</p>

<p>When two play, the one cutting the lowest card has the choice
of seats and cards, (if there are two packs).</p>

<p>When three play, the lowest deals, and chooses his seat and
cards. The next lowest has the next choice of seats.</p>

<p>When four play, partners are cut for; the two lowest pairing
against the two highest; the lowest of the four is the dealer, and
has the choice of seats and cards.</p>

<p>When five play, each for himself, the lowest cut deals, and has
the first choice of seats and cards. The next lowest has the next
choice of seats, and so on.</p>

<p>When six play, they cut for partners, the two lowest pairing together;
the two highest together; and the two intermediates together.
The player cutting the lowest card of the six has the
choice of seats and cards, and deals the first hand. If the six play,
three on a side, the three lowest play against the three highest;
the lowest cut of the six taking the deal, and choice of seats and
cards.</p>

<p>When seven play, each for himself, the lowest deals, and has the
choice of seats and cards; the others choosing their seats in the
order of their cuts.</p>

<p>When eight play, they may form two sets of four each, or four
sets of two each. In either case the partnerships are decided by
cutting, and the lowest cut of the eight has the deal, with choice of
seats and cards.</p>

<p><i><b>TIES</b></i> are decided in the manner already described in connection
with Whist.</p>

<p><i><b>POSITION OF THE PLAYERS.</b></i> Two players sit
opposite each other. Three, five or seven sit according to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
choice. Four sit as at Whist, the partners facing each other. Six,
playing in two partnerships, sit alternately, so that no two partners
shall be next each other. Six, playing in three partnerships of two
each, sit so that two adversaries shall be between each pair of
partners. Eight, playing in two sets of four each, or as four pairs
of partners, arrange themselves alternately. If we distinguish the
partners by the letters A, B, C, D, the diagram will show the arrangement
of the tables.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/p160a.jpg" width="450" height="130" alt="Diagram of the arrangement of the tables" />
</div>

<p>The player to the left of the dealer is the original leader.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> The method of dealing varies with the number
of players engaged. When only one pack is used, any player may
shuffle, the dealer last. The pack must be presented to the pone
to be cut, and the entire pack is then dealt out, one card at a time.</p>

<p>When two play, the dealer gives each six cards, one at a time.
These two hands are kept separate, and two more are dealt in the
same manner, and then a third two, the last card being turned up
for the trump. When the deal is complete, there will be six hands
on the table, three belonging to each player.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/p160b.jpg" width="450" height="180" alt="Diagram of the position of the hands on the table" />
</div>

<p>When three play, the cards are dealt in much the same manner;
two separate hands of six cards being given to each player.</p>

<p>When four, five, six, seven, or eight play, the cards are dealt in
rotation from left to right until the pack is exhausted, the last card
being turned up for the trump. When five or seven play, either
the spade 6 must be thrown out of the pack, or the thirty-sixth
card must be shown, after the dealer has turned the thirty-fifth for
the trump. When eight play, all four sixes are deleted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>The deal passes to the left, each player dealing in turn until the
game is finished.</p>

<p>The general rules with regard to irregularities in the deal are the
same as at Whist.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> When stakes are played for, they are for so much
a game. Rubbers are not played. It is usual to form a pool,
each player depositing the stake agreed upon, and the winner taking
all. In partnership games, each losing player pays the successful
adversary who sits to his right. If three pairs were engaged,
and A-A won, C and B would each pay the A sitting next him.
Before play begins, it should be understood who pays for revokes;
the side or the player.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The player on the dealer’s
left begins by leading any card he chooses, and the others must
all follow suit if they can. Failure to follow suit when able is a revoke,
the penalty for which, if detected and claimed by the adversaries,
is the immediate loss of the game. When there are more
than two players or two sets of partners, the revoking player or
side must pay the two or more adversaries as if each had won the
game. In some places the individual is made to pay, not the side.
This should be understood before play begins. If seven are playing,
and one is detected in a revoke, his loss is equal to six games.
Any player having none of the suit led may either trump or discard.
The dealer should take up the trump card when it is his
turn to play to his first trick; after which it must not be named,
although a player may be informed what the trump suit is. If all
follow suit, the highest card played of the suit led wins the trick,
trumps win all other suits. The winner of the trick may lead any
card he chooses for the next; and so on, until all the cards have
been played.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to keep the tricks separate, as at Whist; but
one player should gather for his side.</p>

<p>When two or three play, the hands must be played in the order
in which they were dealt. For instance: If these are the
hands:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/p161.jpg" width="450" height="175" alt="Diagram of the position of the hands on the table and the play order" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The players first take up hands Nos. 1 and 2; a card is led from
No. 1, the dealer follows suit from No. 2, or trumps, or discards,
and the play continues until these two hands are exhausted. The
second set are then taken up and played in the same manner; the
player who won the last trick in one set having the first lead in
the next. Finally, the third set are played in the same manner;
all the cards taken by each side being gathered into one pile by
the player who has won them. The trump card must remain on
the table until the dealer takes up the last hand. When three
play, the set of hands first dealt must be first played, and then the
second set taken up.</p>

<p>The rules for cards played in error, leading out of turn, etc.,
are the same as at Whist.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> The side first scoring 41
points wins the game; and the chief object is to secure tricks
containing cards to which a certain value is attached. These all
belong to the trump suit, and are the following:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Scores">
  <tr>
    <td>The Jack of trumps counts</td>
    <td class="tdr">11</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The Ace of trumps counts</td>
    <td class="tdr">4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The King of trumps counts</td>
    <td class="tdr">3</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The Ten of trumps counts</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The other trumps, and the plain suit-cards, have no counting
value.</p>

<p>The Jack of trumps, being the best, must be taken in by the
player to whom it is dealt; but any court card in trumps will
win the Ten, so that one of the principal objects in Scotch Whist
is to <i><b>catch the ten</b></i>.</p>

<p>At the end of each hand the players count the number of cards
they have taken in tricks, and they are entitled to score one point
for each above the number originally dealt to them. For instance:
If four play, nine cards were originally dealt to each, so each pair
of partners held eighteen. If at the end of the hand they have
taken in eight tricks, or thirty-two cards, they score 14 points
toward game, in addition to any score they may have made by
winning honours in trumps, or catching the Ten. If five play,
beginning with seven cards each, and at the end of the hand one
player has taken in fifteen, and another ten; they score 8 and 3
respectively, for cards.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> At the end of each hand, each player or side
should claim all honours won, and cards taken in. One player
should keep the score, and announce it distinctly, in order that it
may be known how many points each player or side requires to
win the game.</p>

<p>In the case of ties, the Ten counts out first; then cards; then
A K Q of trumps in their order, and the Jack last. A revoke, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
detected and claimed before the cards are cut for the next deal,
immediately ends the game.</p>

<p><i><b>METHODS OF CHEATING.</b></i> When only one pack is
used, the greek can often succeed in dealing himself the Jack of
trumps, and usually loses no time in marking the Ten, so that he can
at least distinguish the player to whom it is dealt. A player should
be carefully watched who keeps his eyes on the pack while shuffling,
or who rivets his attention on the backs of the cards as he
deals. Two packs should be used in all round games of cards.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> The chief counting
elements that are affected by the play being the trump Ten and
the cards, it is usual to devote particular attention to winning
them. With J A of trumps, or A K, it is best to lead two rounds
immediately; but with a tenace, such as J K, or A Q it is better
to place the lead on your left if possible. The high cards in the
plain suits are capable of being very skilfully managed in this matter
of placing the lead. It sometimes happens that a player with
the Ten may be fourth hand on a suit of which he has none; or
he may catch the Ten with a small honour if it is used in trumping
in. The partnership games offer many fine opportunities for
playing the Ten into the partner’s hand, especially when it is
probable that he has the best trump, or a better trump than the
player on the left.</p>

<p>In calculating the probabilities of saving the Ten by trumping
in, it must be remembered that the greater the number of players,
the less chance there is that a suit will go round more than once,
because there are only nine cards of each suit in play.</p>

<p>Many players, in their anxiety to catch the Ten, overlook the
possibilities of their hands in making cards, the count for which
often runs into high figures.</p>

<p>Close attention should be paid to the score. For instance:
A wants 4 points to win; B wants 10; and C wants 16. If A
can see his way to win the game by cards or small honours, he
should take the first opportunity of giving C the Ten; or allowing
him to make it in preference to B. As the Ten counts first, cards
and honours next, B may be shut out, even if he has the Jack.</p>

<p><i><b>LAWS.</b></i> There are no special laws for Scotch Whist. The
whist laws are usually enforced for all such irregularities as exposed
cards, leading out of turn, etc. The most important matter
is the revoke, and it should be clearly understood before play
begins whether the revoke penalty is to be paid by the individual
in fault, or by the side to which he belongs. Some players think
there should be some regulation for penalties in such cases as that
of a player taking up the wrong hand, when two or more are dealt
to each player; but as no advantage can be gained by the exchange,
it is hard to see what right the adversary would have to
impose a penalty.</p>

<h3>BOSTON.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Boston is played with two packs of fifty-two cards
each, which rank as at Whist, both for cutting and playing.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKERS</b></i> are not used in Boston, every hand being immediately
settled for in counters. These are usually of three
colours; white, red, and blue; representing cents, dimes, and
dollars respectively. At the beginning of the game each player
should be provided with an equal number, the general proportion
being 20 white, 18 red, and 8 blue for each. Some one player
should be selected to act as the banker, selling and redeeming all
counters.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> The stakes in Boston depend upon the value of
the counters. One cent for a white counter is considered a pretty
stiff game; because it is quite possible for a single player to win
or lose a thousand white counters on one hand, and the payments
very seldom fall short of fifty.</p>

<p><i><b>THE POOL.</b></i> In addition to the counters won and lost on
each hand, it is usual for the players to make up a pool at the beginning
of the game by each of them depositing one red counter
in a small tray provided for the purpose. This pool may be increased
from time to time by penalties; such as one red counter
for a misdeal; four for a revoke, or for not having the proper
number of cards, etc. The whole amount in the pool may be won
or lost by the players, according to their success or failure in certain
undertakings, which will presently be described. When
empty, the pool is replenished by contributions from each player,
as at first.</p>

<p>The pool proper is usually limited to 25 red counters. When it
exceeds that amount, the 25 are set aside, and the surplus used to
start a fresh pool. Any player winning a pool is entitled to 25 red
counters at the most. It will often happen that several such pools
will accumulate, and each must be played for in its turn. At the
end of the game any counters remaining in the pool or pools must
be divided among the players.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Boston is played by four persons. If more
than four candidates offer for play, five or six may form a table;
if there are more than six, the selection of the table must be made
by cutting, as at Whist.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> The four persons who shall play the first
game are determined by cutting, and they again cut for the deal,
with the choice of seats and cards. The player drawing the
lowest card deals, and chooses his seat; the next lower card sits
on his left, and so on, until all are seated. Twelve deals is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
game, at the end of which the players cut to decide which shall go
out, as at Whist.</p>

<p>It is usual to count the deals by opening the blade of a pocket-knife,
which is placed on the table by the player on the dealer’s
right. When it comes to his turn to deal, he partly opens one
blade. When he deals again he opens it entirely, and the third
time he closes it; that being the third round, and the last deal of
the game.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fourth Deal.</span> <span class="smcap spacer">Eighth Deal.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i><b>POSITION OF THE PLAYERS.</b></i> The four players at
Boston are distinguished by the letters A Y B Z.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p166b.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Diagram of the position of the players at the table" />
</div>

<p>Z is the dealer, and A is known as the <i><b>eldest hand</b></i>. There
are no partnerships in Boston, except that of three players combined
against the fourth, who is always spoken of as <i><b>the caller</b></i>.
The players having once taken their seats are not allowed to
change them without the consent of all the others at the table.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> At the beginning of the game the two packs
are thoroughly shuffled; after which they must not again be
shuffled during the progress of the game. If a hand is dealt
and not played, each player must sort his cards into suits and
sequences before they are gathered and dealt again.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each deal, one pack is presented to the
players to be cut; each having the privilege of cutting once, the
dealer last. Beginning on his left, the dealer gives four cards to
each player, then four more, and finally five; no trump being
turned.</p>

<p>The general rules with regard to irregularities in the deal are
the same as at Whist, except that a misdeal does not lose the deal.
The misdealer must deal again with the same pack, after the
players have sorted their cards into suits. It is a misdeal if the
dealer fails to present the pack to the other players to cut, or neglects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to cut it himself. Should the dealer expose any of his own
cards in dealing, that does not invalidate the deal. The deal passes
in regular rotation to the left, each pack being used alternately.</p>

<p><i><b>MAKING THE TRUMP.</b></i> The deal being complete,
the player opposite the dealer cuts the still pack, and the player on
his right turns up the top card for the trump. The suit to which
this card belongs is called <i><b>First Preference</b></i>, and the suit of the
same colour is called <i><b>Second Preference</b></i>, or <i><b>Colour</b></i>. The
two remaining suits are known as <i><b>Plain Suits</b></i> for that deal.</p>

<p>The cards having been dealt, and the trump turned, each
player carefully sorts and counts his cards, to see that he has the
correct number, thirteen. A player having more or less than his
right proportion should at once claim a misdeal; for if he plays
with a defective hand he cannot win anything that deal, but must
stand his proportion of all losses incurred, besides paying a forfeit
of four red counters to the pool.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> In Boston, each player has
an opportunity to announce that he is willing to undertake to win
a certain number of tricks, if allowed the privilege of naming the
trump suit; or to lose a certain number, there being no trumps.
In either case, he proposes to play single-handed against the three
other players. The player proposing the undertaking which is
most difficult of accomplishment is said to <i><b>over-call</b></i> the others,
and must be allowed to try. If he is successful, he wins the pool,
and is paid a certain number of counters by each of his adversaries.
If he fails, he must double the amount in the pool, and pay
to each of the other players a certain number of counters.</p>

<p><i><b>ANNOUNCEMENTS.</b></i> The bids rank in the following order,
beginning with the lowest. The full-faced type shows the words
used by the players in calling their bids:&mdash;</p>

<p>To win five tricks; <i><b>Boston</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win <i><b>Six Tricks</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win <i><b>Seven Tricks</b></i>.</p>

<p>To lose twelve tricks, after having discarded a card which is
not to be shown; <i><b>Little Misère</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win <i><b>Eight Tricks</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win <i><b>Nine Tricks</b></i>.</p>

<p>To lose every trick; <i><b>Grand Misère</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win <i><b>Ten Tricks</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win <i><b>Eleven Tricks</b></i>.</p>

<p>To lose twelve tricks, after having discarded a card which is not
to be shown; the single player’s remaining twelve cards being exposed
face up on the table, but not liable to be called; <i><b>Little
Spread</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win <i><b>Twelve Tricks</b></i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>To lose every trick; the single player’s cards exposed on the
table, but not liable to be called; <i><b>Grand Spread</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win Thirteen Tricks; <i><b>Grand Slam</b></i>.</p>

<p>The object of the proposing player, if successful in his bid, is to
win or lose the proposed number of tricks; while that of his three
adversaries is to combine to prevent him from so doing. There
are no honours, and the only factor in the count is the number of
tricks taken. The highest card played of the suit led wins the
trick; and trumps, if any, win against all other suits.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF BIDDING.</b></i> The eldest hand has the first
say, and after examining his cards, and estimating the number of
tricks he can probably take, making the trump to suit his hand,
he bids accordingly. It is not necessary for him to state which
suit he wishes to make the trump; but only the number of tricks
he proposes to win. If he has no proposal to make, he says distinctly;
“<i><b>I pass</b></i>,” and the other players in turn have an opportunity
to bid. If any player makes a bid, such as six tricks, and
any other player thinks he can make the same number of tricks
with a trump of the same colour as the turn-up, that is, Second
Preference, he over-calls the first bidder by saying “<i><b>I keep</b></i>;”
or he may repeat the number bid, saying “<i><b>Six here</b></i>.” This
is simply bidding to win the number of tricks <i><b>in colour</b></i>. The
original caller may hold his bid, or a third player may overbid
both, by saying; “<i><b>I keep over you</b></i>,” or “<i><b>Six here</b></i>.”
This means that he will undertake to win the number of tricks
already bid, with the <i><b>turn-up</b></i> suit for trumps. In order to over-call
such a bid as this, any other player would have to announce a
greater number of tricks. For instance; Z deals, and turns a
heart. A calls six tricks, intending to name hearts trumps; but
not saying so. B passes; Y says “I Keep.” This announces to
the table that Y will play with a red trump, and A knows he is
bidding on diamonds. Z passes, and A says; “I keep over you.”
B then bids seven tricks, and if A will not risk seven tricks in
hearts, B will be the successful bidder. If A should bid seven
tricks by keeping over B, the latter must know that it is useless
for him to bid again unless he can make more tricks in diamonds
than A can in hearts; for A’s bid, being in first preference, will
always outrank B’s for the same number of tricks.</p>

<p>A player once having passed cannot come into the bidding again,
except to call one of the misères. In the example just given,
either Y or Z, after having twice passed, might have outbid the seven
tricks by calling a little misère. Such a bid can, of course, be entertained
only when it outranks any bid already made.</p>

<p>A player is not compelled to bid the full value of his hand; but
it is to his interest to go as near to it as he can with safety; because,
as we shall see presently, the more he bids the more he is
paid. For instance: If he can make ten tricks, but bids seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
only, he will be paid for the three over-tricks, if he makes them;
but the payment for seven bid and ten taken, is only 22 counters;
while the payment for ten bid and ten taken is 42. As he receives
from each adversary, a player who underbid his hand in this manner
would lose 60 counters by his timidity.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that no one will make a proposal of any
sort. It is very unusual to pass the deal. The trump is generally
turned down, and a <i><b>Grand</b></i> is played, without any trump suit.
This is sometimes called a <i><b>Misère Partout</b></i>, or “all-round poverty”;
and the object of each player is to take as few tricks as
possible.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> No matter who is the successful
bidder, the eldest hand always leads for the first trick, and
the others must follow suit if they can, the play proceeding exactly
as at Whist. The tricks should be carefully stacked, so that they
can be readily counted by any player without calling attention to
them. The laws provide a severe penalty for drawing attention to
the score in this manner. Suppose a player has called eight tricks.
An adversary hesitates in his play, and another reaches over and
counts the tricks in front of the caller, finding he has seven. This is
tantamount to saying to the player who hesitates: “If you don’t win
that trick, the call succeed.” In such a case, the single player may
at once demand the play of the highest or lowest of the suit; or
that the adversaries trump or refrain from trumping the trick.</p>

<p>In all calls except misères and slams, the hands should be played
out, in order to allow the players to make what over-tricks they
can; but the moment a misère player takes a trick, or a slam
player loses one, the hands are thrown up, and the stakes paid.
It is usual to show the cards to the board, in order to satisfy each
player that no revoke has occurred.</p>

<p>When Little Misère is called, each player discards one card,
which must not be shown, and the hand is then played out with
the remaining twelve cards.</p>

<p>When Spreads are called, the caller’s cards must be placed face
upwards on the table before a card is played. If it is a Little
Spread, the discard of each player must remain unknown. The
adversaries have no control of the manner of playing the exposed
cards, which cannot be called, and may be played in any manner
suited to the judgment of the single player, provided he follows
suit when able.</p>

<p><i><b>REVOKES.</b></i> If a player opposed to the caller revokes, but
discovers his mistake in time to save himself, he may be called
upon by the single player for his highest or lowest of the suit led;
or the card played in error may be claimed as an exposed card.
If the highest or lowest of the suit is called, the card played in
error is taken up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>If the caller revokes, and discovers his mistake in time, he is not
liable to any penalty, unless an adversary has played to the next
trick. In that case the revoking card must be left on the table,
and is liable to be called. When the single player revokes, he
loses the call in any case, and at least one trick besides. He must
also double the pool, and add to it a revoke forfeit of four red
counters. For instance: A bids eight tricks, and his adversaries
detect and claim a revoke. As he is supposed to have lost his
bid, and one trick more, he may be said to have bid eight, and
taken only seven; losing 23 white counters to each of his adversaries,
doubling the pool, and then paying a forfeit of four red
counters. In some places the forfeit is omitted, and in others it
takes the place of doubling the pool. It is not usual to play the
hand out after a revoke is claimed and proved.</p>

<p>If an adversary of the single player revokes, he and his partners
must each pay the caller just as if he had been successful, and
must also pay him for three over-tricks as forfeit, provided his bid
was not more than nine tricks; for the bid and the over-tricks
together must not exceed thirteen tricks. In addition to this, the
individual player in fault must pay four red counters as forfeit to
the pool. In some places he is made to double the pool; but this
is manifestly unfair, as he could not win the amount in the pool in
any case, and therefore should not lose it.</p>

<p>In a Misère Partout, the revoking player pays five red counters
to each adversary, and deposits a forfeit of four red counters in
the pool. The hands are immediately thrown up if the revoke is
claimed and proved.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS PLAYED IN ERROR.</b></i> The single player is
not liable to any penalty for cards played in error, or led out of
turn, except those taken back to save a revoke; but his adversaries
are liable to the usual whist penalties for all such irregularities.
The single player can forbid the use of an exposed trump for
ruffing, and can demand or prevent the play of an exposed card in
plain suits, provided he does not ask the adversary to revoke. If
a suit is led of which an adversary has an exposed card on the
table, the single player may call upon him to play his highest or
lowest of that suit.</p>

<p>If a player has announced Little Misère, and one of the adversaries
leads before the others have discarded, the caller may immediately
claim the pool and stakes. If any adversary of a
misère player leads out of turn, or exposes a card, or plays
before his proper turn in any trick, the bidder may at once claim
the pool and stakes. In all such cases it is usual for the individual
in fault to pay a forfeit of four red counters toward the next
pool.</p>

<p>In Misère Partout, there is no penalty for cards played in error,
or led out of turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>PAYMENTS.</b></i> If the caller succeeds in winning the proposed
number of tricks, he is paid by each of his adversaries according
to the value of his bid, and the number of over-tricks he
wins, if any. The various payments are shown in this table:&mdash;</p>

<p>The American system is not to pay the successful bidder for
any over-tricks. This is to make him bid up his hand, and to save
time; as hands need not be played out when the bidder has made
or can show the number of tricks bid.</p>

<p>If the caller fails in his undertaking, he must pay each adversary
according to the number of tricks by which he failed to reach
his bid. For instance: A player bidding eight, and taking only
seven, is said to be “<i><b>put in for</b></i>” one trick, and he would have
to pay each adversary 23 white counters. These payments are
shown in this table:&mdash;</p>

<p>If a misère is bid, the caller wins from, or loses to each adversary
according to the following table, there being no over-tricks:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Scoring in the event of a misère">
  <tr>
    <td>Little Misère,</td>
    <td class="tdr">20 white counters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Grand Misère,</td>
    <td class="tdr">40 white counters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Little Spread,</td>
    <td class="tdr">80 white counters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Grand Spread,</td>
    <td class="tdr">160 white counters.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>It may be observed that each of these is twice the amount of the
next lower.</p>

<p>When misère partout is played, the person winning the largest
number of tricks is the only loser, and he must pay each of the
other players the difference between the number of his tricks and
theirs in red counters. The number of red counters lost will always
be found to be three times the number of tricks taken, minus
the number of tricks not taken. For instance: A wins 4 tricks,
three times which is 12; from which he deducts 9, the number he
did not take, and finds his loss to be 3 red counters. Again; A
wins 7 tricks; three times which is 21; minus 6 tricks not taken, a
net loss of 15. No matter in what proportion the other tricks may
be divided between the three other players, this total payment will
always be found correct. For instance: A wins 6 tricks; Y 2;
B 5; and Z none. A loses 6 x 3 = 18-7 = 11, of which he
gives 4 to Y; 1 to B; and 6 to Z.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>If two players tie for the greatest number of tricks taken, they
calculate their losses in the same manner; but each pays only half
the total. For instance: A and Y each take 5 tricks; B taking 1,
and Z 2. The 7 red counters lost by A and Y being divided,
shows a loss of 35 white counters for each of them. If three
players take four tricks apiece, they each pay the fourth man a
red counter.</p>

<p><i><b>WINNING THE POOL.</b></i> Besides the white counters
won and lost by the players individually, the successful caller
takes the pool, provided he has made a bid of seven tricks or better,
which is called <i><b>a pool bid</b></i>. Any lower bid does not entitle
him to the pool, unless the other players compel him to play the
hand out. In order to save the pool, it is usual for the adversaries,
before playing to the second trick, to say: “<i><b>I pay.</b></i>” If
all agree to pay, the bidder must accept the amount of his bid
without any over-tricks, and the pool is not touched. If a player
has made a pool bid, and the adversaries, before playing to the
second trick, agree to pay, they cannot prevent the caller from
taking the pool; but they save possible over-tricks. The agreement
of the adversaries to pay must be unanimous.</p>

<p>Misère Partout does not touch the pool.</p>

<p>If the hand is played out, and the caller fails, he must double
the pool, whether he has made a pool bid or not. If there is more
than one pool, he must double the first one, which will of course
contain the limit. This will simply have the effect of forming an
additional pool to be played for.</p>

<p>When there are several pools on the table, a successful caller
takes any of those that contain the limit. When there is only one
pool on the table, he must be satisfied with its contents, however
small.</p>

<p>At the end of the game, after the twelfth hand has been settled
for, it is usual to divide the pool or pools equally among the
players. But sometimes a grand is played without trumps, making
a thirteenth hand, and the pool is given to the player winning
the last trick.</p>

<p><i><b>METHODS OF CHEATING.</b></i> There being no shuffling
at Boston, and each player having the right to cut the pack,
the greek must be very skilful who can secure himself any advantage
by having the last cut, unless he has the courage to use
wedges. But Boston is usually played for such high stakes that it
naturally attracts those possessing a high degree of skill, and the
system adopted is usually that of counting down. The greek will
watch for a hand in which there is little changing of suits, and
will note the manner of taking up the cards. The next hand does
not interest him, as he is busy studying the location of the cards
in the still pack. When this comes into play on the next deal, he
will follow every cut, and finally cut for himself so that the desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
distribution of the suits shall come about. Even if he fails
to secure an invincible hand for bidding on himself, he knows so
nearly the contents of the other hands that he can bid them up,
and afterwards play against them to great advantage.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to say that if a greek can mark the cards, the
game becomes a walkover, even if he can recollect only the hand
on his left.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> Boston so
closely resembles Solo Whist in such matters as bidding, and playing
single-handed against three others, that the reader may be
referred to that game for the outlines of the principles that should
guide him in estimating the probable value of his hand, playing
for tricks or for misères, and combining forces with his partners
for the purpose of defeating the single player.</p>

<p>For laws, see Whist Family Laws.</p>

<h3>BOSTON DE FONTAINEBLEAU.</h3>

<p>This game is sometimes, but incorrectly, called French Boston.
The latter will be described in its proper place.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Boston de Fontainebleau is played with a full pack
of fifty-two cards. Two packs are generally used. The cards
rank as at Whist, both for cutting and playing.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKERS</b></i> are not used, counters taking their place.
These are usually of the colours and values, and are distributed
among the players as already described in Boston.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> As a guide in settling upon the unit value, it may
be noted that the largest amount possible to win or lose on a
single hand is 2,400 white counters; the smallest amount being
30. The average is about 300.</p>

<p><i><b>THE POOL.</b></i> In addition to the counters won or lost on
each hand, a pool is formed by each dealer in his turn placing five
counters in a small tray provided for the purpose. This pool may
be increased by penalties, etc., and the whole amount may be won
under certain conditions, as at Boston. There is no limit to the
amount of a single pool.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> The number of players, methods of <i><b>Cutting</b></i>,
<i>Dealing</i>, etc., are the same as those already described in connection
with Boston, except that no trump is turned for first preference,
the suits always having a determined rank; diamonds being
first, hearts next, then clubs, and last spades. No-trump, or
“grand,” outranks diamonds.</p>

<p>Twelve deals is a game; after which the players cut out if there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
are more than four belonging to the table, or if other candidates
are waiting to play.</p>

<p><i><b>PENALTIES</b></i>, for playing with more or less than the proper
number of cards, etc., are the same as at Boston.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> These are identical with
Boston, but instead of doubling the pool, the player who is unsuccessful
in his undertaking pays into the pool the same amount that
he loses to each of the other players.</p>

<p><i><b>ANNOUNCEMENTS.</b></i> The bids rank in the order following;
beginning with the lowest. The full-faced type show the
words used by the players in calling their bids. It will be noticed
that the order is not the same as in Boston, and that an additional
bid is introduced, called Piccolissimo.</p>

<p>To win 5 tricks, <i><b>Boston</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win <i><b>Six Tricks</b></i>.</p>

<p>To lose 12 tricks, after having discarded a card which is not to
be shown; <i><b>Little Misère</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win <i><b>Seven Tricks</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win one trick, neither more nor less, after having discarded
a card which is not to be shown, there being no trump suit; <i><b>Piccolissimo</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win <i><b>Eight Tricks</b></i>.</p>

<p>To lose every trick, no trump suit, <i><b>Grand Misère</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win <i><b>Nine Tricks</b></i>.</p>

<p>To lose 12 tricks, after having discarded a card which is not to
be shown; the single player’s remaining twelve cards being exposed
face up on the table, but not liable to be called; <i><b>Little
Spread</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win <i><b>Ten Tricks</b></i>.</p>

<p>To lose every trick, no trump suit, the single player’s cards being
exposed on the table, but not liable to be called; <i><b>Grand
Spread</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win <i><b>Eleven Tricks</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win <i><b>Twelve Tricks</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win 13 tricks; <i><b>Slam</b></i>.</p>

<p>To win 13 tricks, the single player’s cards exposed face up on
the table, but not liable to be called; <i><b>Spread Slam</b></i>.</p>

<p>The object of the bidder, if successful in securing the privilege
of playing, is to win or lose the proposed number of tricks, against
the combined efforts of his adversaries. Having once made a bid,
he must play it unless he is over-called.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF BIDDING.</b></i> The eldest hand has the
first say, and after examining his hand, and deciding on the bid
most appropriate to it, if any, he makes his announcement. If
his proposal is to win a certain number of tricks with a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
suit for trumps, he must name the suit, saying, “Eight Spades,”
or “Seven Diamonds,” as the case may be. If he proposes to
play without any trump suit, he announces, “Seven Grand,” or
whatever the number may be. Such a bid over-calls one of the
same number in diamonds. If the eldest hand has no proposal to
make, he says, “I pass,” and the others in turn have an opportunity
to bid. The bids outrank one another according to their order
in the foregoing table, and the rank of the suits in which they are
made. The players bid against one another, until all but one declare
to pass, he then becomes the single player against the three
others.</p>

<p>A player having once passed cannot come into the bidding
again, even to call a misère. In this respect the game differs
from Boston. A player is not compelled to bid the full value
of his hand, but it is to his interest to do so, and he should
make the full announcement the first time he bids, because if
he has had a good hand for ten tricks, and begins with a bid
of seven, he cannot increase his proposal unless some player bids
over him.</p>

<p><i><b>PARTNERS.</b></i> Before playing, the successful bidder may
call for a partner if he chooses to do so. The player accepting
him undertakes that the two together shall win three tricks more
than the number bid. For instance: A has successfully bid seven
in diamonds, and asks for a partner. If Y accepts him they make
no change in their positions at the table, but play into each other’s
hands, just as at Solo Whist, B and Z being partners against them.
A and Y together must win ten tricks, with diamonds for trumps.</p>

<p>If no one makes a proposal of any sort, <i><b>Misère Partout</b></i> is
played; there being no trump suit. The player or players taking
the least number of tricks win or divide the pool. There are no
other losses or gains in Misère Partout.</p>

<p><i><b>HONOURS.</b></i> In any call in which there is a trump suit, the
A K Q and J of trumps are honours, and may be counted by the successful
bidder if he carries out his proposal. If the single player,
or a caller and his partner have all four honours dealt them, they
score as for four over-tricks; if three, as for two over-tricks.
Honours do not count for the adversaries under any circumstances.</p>

<p>In bidding on a hand, it must be remembered that although
honours will count as over-tricks in payments, they cannot be bid
on. If a player has nine tricks and two by honours in his hand, he
cannot bid eleven. If he bids nine and fails to make so many, he
cannot count the honours at all. It is growing less and less the
custom to count honours in America.</p>

<p>A player making a bid can be compelled to play it; but it is
usual to allow him to pay instead of playing, if he proposes to do
so, either because he has overbid his hand or for any other
reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> No matter who is the
successful bidder, the eldest hand always leads for the first trick,
and the others must follow suit if they can, the play proceeding
exactly as in Whist. Tricks should be carefully stacked, there
being the same penalties as in Boston for calling attention to the
score. The methods of playing misères and spreads have already
been described in connection with Boston. When piccolissimo is
played, the moment the single player takes more than one trick
the hands are thrown up, and the stakes paid.</p>

<p><i><b>REVOKES.</b></i> The rules governing these and cards played in
error, are the same as at Boston. In piccolissimo, the penalties
are the same as in misère.</p>

<p><i><b>PAYMENTS.</b></i> If the caller succeeds in winning the proposed
number of tricks, he is paid by each of his adversaries
according to the value of his bid, as shown in Table No. 1. Over-tricks
if any, and honours, if played, are always paid at the uniform
rate of five white counters each. If the caller fails, he must pay
each adversary the amount he would have won if successful, with
the addition of five white counters for every trick that he falls
short of his proposal. For instance: He bids nine hearts, and
wins six tricks only. He must pay each adversary 115 white
counters.</p>

<p>Why a player should be paid more for spreads than for eleven
or twelve tricks while the trick bid outranks the spreads, is difficult
to understand; but we have no authority to change the tables.</p>

<p>Misère Partout wins nothing but the pool.</p>

<p>If partners play, it is usual for the losers to pay the adversaries
on their right; or, if partners sit together, to pay the adversary
sitting next.</p>

<p><i><b>THE POOL.</b></i> Besides the white counters won and lost by
the players individually, the successful player takes the pool. Successful
partners divide it equally, regardless of the number of
tricks bid or taken by each. If the partners fail, they must contribute
to the pool an amount equal to that which they pay to one
adversary. For instance: A calls seven diamonds, and asks for
a partner. Y accepts him, and the pair win only nine tricks.
Each pays 135 counters to the adversary sitting next him, and then
they make up 135 more between them for the pool.</p>

<p>Asking for a partner is not a popular variation of the game,
and is seldom resorted to unless the successful bid is very low, or
has been made on a black suit.</p>

<p>If the adversaries of the caller declare to pay, before playing to
the second trick, they can save nothing but possible over-tricks.
The pool goes with every successful play.</p>

<p>If the single player is unsuccessful, he does not double the pool,
as in Boston, but pays into it the same amount that he loses to
each adversary, over-tricks and all; so that he really loses four
times the amount shown in the table.</p>

<p>At the end of the game, or on the twelfth hand, if the caller
does not succeed, he pays the pool as usual, and his adversaries
then divide it amongst themselves.</p>

<p>The <i><b>Suggestions for Good Play</b></i>, etc., are given in connection
with Solo Whist and need no further amplification for
Boston de Fontainbleau.</p>

<p>The <i><b>Laws</b></i> vary so little from those used in the regular game
of Boston that it is not necessary to give an additional code, either
for Fontainbleau or for French Boston, which follows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<h3>FRENCH BOSTON.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> French Boston is played with a full pack of fifty-two
cards, which rank as at Whist, both for cutting and playing;
except that the diamond Jack is always the best trump unless diamonds
are turned up, in which case the heart Jack becomes the
best trump, and the diamond Jack ranks next below the diamond
Queen.</p>

<p><i><b>COUNTERS</b></i> are used as in Boston, their value being a
matter of agreement before play begins.</p>

<p><i><b>THE POOL</b></i> is made up by the dealer’s contributing ten
counters for the first eight rounds, and twenty for the last two. It
is increased from time to time by penalties, and is won or lost by
the players, just as in Boston. There is no limit to the pool. If
any player objects to dividing it at the end of the game, it must
be played for until some player wins it.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> The number of players, their arrangement at
the table, etc., is precisely the same as at Boston.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> Instead of cutting for the first deal, any one of
the players takes a pack of cards, and gives thirteen to each player
in succession, face up. The player to whom he gives the diamond
Jack deals the first hand, and has the choice of seats and cards.
The others sit as they please.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> The cards are shuffled before every deal. The
player on the left of the dealer cuts, and cards are given first to
the player on the dealer’s right, dealing from right to left. The
cards may be dealt one at a time, or three at a time, or four at a
time, always dealing the last round singly, and turning up the
last card. A misdeal loses the deal. Other irregularities are
governed by the same laws as in Boston.</p>

<p>The deal passes to the right, and the next dealer is indicated by
the position of the tray containing the pool, which the dealer always
passes to the player on his right, after putting in his ten or
twenty counters.</p>

<p>Forty deals is a game; the first thirty-two of which are called
“simples,” and the last eight “doubles.” In the doubles, all stakes
and contributions to the pool are doubled. If anything remains in
the pool at the end, it is divided equally, unless a player demands
that it shall be played for until won. Such extra deals are simples.</p>

<p><i><b>RANK OF THE SUITS.</b></i> The suit turned on the first
deal is called “belle” for that game. The suit turned on each
succeeding deal is called “petite.” If belle turns up again, there
is no petite for that deal. The suits are not first and second
preference, as in Boston, but are used only to determine the value
of the payments, and to settle which suits partners must name for
trumps. The rank of the suits is permanent, as in Boston de Fontainbleau,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
but the order is, hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades;
hearts being highest. In France, the suits rank in this order in
Boston de Fontainbleau, but in America diamonds outrank hearts.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> Each player in turn has
an opportunity to announce that he is willing to undertake to win
a certain number of tricks, if allowed the privilege of naming the
trump suit; or to lose a certain number, there being no trump
suit. If he proposes to play alone, he may select any suit for
trumps; but if he takes a partner the trump suit must be belle or
petite. The announcements outrank each other in certain order,
and the player making the highest must be allowed to play. If he
succeeds in his undertaking, he wins the pool, and is also paid a
certain number of counters by each of his adversaries. If he fails,
he must double the pool, and pay each of his adversaries. The
table of payments will be given later.</p>

<p><i><b>ANNOUNCEMENTS.</b></i> The proposals rank in the order
following, beginning with the lowest. The French terms are
given in <i><b>italics</b></i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Five tricks; or eight with a partner, in petite. <i><b>Simple in
petite</b></i>.</p>

<p>Five tricks; or eight with a partner, in belle. <i><b>Simple in belle</b></i>.</p>

<p>Six tricks solo, in any suit. <i><b>Petite independence</b></i>.</p>

<p>Little misère. <i><b>Petite misère</b></i>.</p>

<p>Eight tricks solo in any suit. <i><b>Grand independence</b></i>.</p>

<p>Grand misère. <i><b>Grand misère</b></i>, or <i><b>misère sans ecart</b></i>.</p>

<p>Misère with four aces. <i><b>Misère des quatre as</b></i>.</p>

<p>Nine tricks in any suit. <i><b>Neuf</b></i>.</p>

<p>Nine tricks in petite. <i><b>Neuf en petite</b></i>.</p>

<p>Nine tricks in belle. <i><b>Neuf en belle</b></i>.</p>

<p>Little spread. <i><b>Petite misère sur table</b></i>.</p>

<p>Grand spread. <i><b>Grand misère sur table</b></i>.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF BIDDING.</b></i> The player to the right of
the dealer has the first say. If he proposes to take a partner as in
Solo Whist, he says, “Je demande,” at the same time placing one
of his cards face downward on the table. This card must not be
shown or named, but must be of the suit which he proposes to
make the trump. He is not allowed to announce the suit, so that
any player accepting him as a partner does so in ignorance as to
whether he will play in belle or in petite. If the demand is accepted,
the proposer and his partner make no change in their positions
at the table, but must make eight tricks, just as in Solo Whist.</p>

<p>If a player cannot propose, he says: “Je passe,” and each of
the others in turn from right to left have the opportunity to make
a proposal. When any player proposes, any player in turn after
him may accept, although such a one may have already passed.
If the fourth player proposes, the three others having passed, and
no one will accept him he is bound to play solo against three such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
weak adversaries, and must make five tricks, either in belle or in
petite. He is not allowed to play in a plain suit if he has made a
simple “demand.”</p>

<p>The only solo bids allowed are those for six, eight, or nine tricks,
which outrank one another. A player cannot bid seven to over-call
six; he must go to eight; and a player cannot <i><b>bid</b></i> five tricks without
a partner, although, as we have just seen, he may be forced to
<i><b>play</b></i> in that manner.</p>

<p>When six, eight, or nine tricks are bid, the suits outrank one
another for equal numbers of tricks; but as the suit called need not
be the bidder’s true intention, nor the same as the card laid on the
table, the proposer must be careful that his play will be as good as
his bid. For instance: He intends nine tricks in spades, but proposes
eight in diamonds. He cannot bid nine in diamonds, for
that would be a better bid than he intends to play; but the ruse
may succeed in inducing a player not to bid against him, hoping
diamonds is the true suit. It is a common artifice to bid the
true suit, because few will believe it to be such.</p>

<p>If clubs are belle, and diamonds petite, and a player who
“demands” is over-called by a demand in belle, or a call of six
tricks, the first caller cannot advance his bid to six tricks except in
the suit which he has already laid on the table; but he may accept
the player over-calling him, instead of bidding against him. After
a player has once accepted or passed, he cannot bid misère.</p>

<p>If no one makes a proposition of any kind, the hands are thrown
up; the next dealer contributes to the pool, and a fresh hand is dealt.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> As in Boston, the eldest
hand has the first lead, and the others must follow suit if they can,
except in the misère des quatre as. When this is played, the bidder
may renounce at pleasure for the first ten tricks.</p>

<p><i><b>GATHERING TRICKS.</b></i> When a partnership is formed,
each gathers the tricks he takes. If the partnership loses, the one
who has not his complement of tricks must pay the adversaries
and double the pool. If the demander has not five, and the acceptor
has three, the demander pays. If the proposer has five,
and the acceptor has not three, the acceptor pays; but they both
win if they have eight tricks between them, no matter in what
proportion. If neither has taken his proper share, they must both
pay. When they are successful, they divide the pool.</p>

<p><i><b>SLAMS.</b></i> If a player has demanded, and not been accepted,
and has been forced to play alone for five tricks, but wins eight, it
is called a slam. But as he did not wish to play alone, his only
payment, besides the pool, is 24 counters from each player if he
played in petite; 48 if in belle; double those amounts if the deal
was one of the last eight in the game.</p>

<p>If two partners make a slam, thirteen tricks, they take the pool,
and receive from each adversary 24 counters if they played in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
petite; 48 if in belle; double if in one of the last eight hands in the
game.</p>

<p><i><b>EXPOSED CARDS.</b></i> The laws governing these are almost
identical with those in Boston, with the additional rule that a
player allowing a card to fall upon the table face up before play
begins, can be forced to play independence in that suit.</p>

<p><i><b>REVOKES.</b></i> The individual player who is detected in a revoke
must double the pool, and pay both adversaries.</p>

<p><i><b>PAYMENTS.</b></i> Payments are made according to the table.
The player holding diamond Jack receives two counters from each
of the other players in a simple; four in a double; except in
misères, in which the card has no value.</p>

<p>Misères are paid for according to the trump turned in the deal
in which they are played. If a heart is turned, and little misère is
played, the payment is 64 counters to or from each player. If a
spade was turned, the payment would be 16 only.</p>

<p>Three honours between partners count as three: four as four.
Being all in one hand does not increase their value.</p>

<h3>RUSSIAN BOSTON.</h3>

<p>This is a variation of Boston de Fontainbleau. A player holding
carte blanche declares it before playing, and receives ten
counters from each of the other players. Carte blanche is the
same thing as chicane in Bridge, no trump in the hand. But in
Bridge the player is penalized for announcing it until after the
hand is played.</p>

<p>The order of the suits is the same as in American Boston de
Fontainbleau: diamonds, hearts, clubs, and spades.</p>

<p>When a player bids six, seven, or eight tricks, he is supposed to
be still willing to take a partner, unless he specifies solo. When a
partner accepts him, the combination must make four tricks more
than the original proposal.</p>

<p>Four honours are paid for as four over-tricks; three honours as
two over-tricks.</p>

<p>Piccolissimo is played, and comes between the bids of seven and
eight tricks.</p>

<h3>GERMAN WHIST.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> German Whist is played with a full pack of fifty-two
cards, which rank as at Whist, both for cutting and playing.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Two persons play. They cut for the first
deal, and the choice of seats.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> The dealer presents the pack to his adversary
to be cut, and then gives thirteen cards to each player, one at a
time, turning up the twenty-seventh card for the trump, and laying
it on the talon, or remainder of the pack.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYING.</b></i> The non-dealer begins by leading any card he
pleases, and his adversary must follow suit if he can. The
winner of the first trick takes the trump card into his hand, and
his adversary takes the card immediately under it, but without
showing or naming it. Each player thus restores the number of
cards in his hand to thirteen. The card which is now on the top
of the talon is turned up, and the winner of the next trick must
take it, his adversary taking the one under it, as before, and turning
up the next. In this manner it will be seen that the winner of
each trick must always get a card which is known to his adversary,
while the loser of the trick gets one which remains unknown.</p>

<p>When the talon is exhausted, the thirteen cards in each hand
should be known to both players if they have been observant, and
the end game becomes a problem in double dummy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> The game is usually played for so much a point,
the player having won the majority of the tricks receiving the difference
between the number of his tricks and those of his adversary.
Each game is complete in one hand.</p>

<p>In many respects the game resembles single-handed Hearts, except
that in Hearts none of the cards drawn are shown.</p>

<h3>CHINESE WHIST.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Chinese Whist is played with a full pack of fifty-two
cards, which rank as at Whist, both for cutting and playing.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKERS.</b></i> Ordinary whist markers are used for scoring
the points.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Two, three or four persons can play Chinese
Whist. When three play, the spade deuce is thrown out of the
pack. Partners and deal are cut for from an outspread pack, as
at Whist.</p>

<p><i><b>POSITION OF THE PLAYERS.</b></i> When four play, the
partners sit opposite each other. When three play, the one cutting
the lowest card chooses his seat, and dictates the positions of
the two other players.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> When four play, the pack is shuffled and cut
as at Whist. The dealer then gives six cards to each player, one
at a time, beginning on his left. These six cards are then spread
face down on the table in front of the players to whom they have
been dealt, but without being looked at. Six more are then dealt
to each, one at a time, and these are turned face up, and sorted
into suits. They are then laid face up on the top of the six cards
which are lying on the table face down, so as to cover them. The
last four cards are then dealt, one to each player. These last are
retained in the hand, and must not be shown or named; they are
usually called the “<i><b>down cards</b></i>.”</p>

<p><i><b>MAKING THE TRUMP.</b></i> After examining the cards
exposed on the table, and the down card in his own hand, the
dealer has the privilege of naming any suit he pleases for trumps.
No consultation with partner is allowed.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The player to the left of
the dealer begins by leading any one of his exposed cards,
and the others must follow suit if they can; either with one of
their exposed cards, or with their down cards. A player having
none of the suit led may either discard or trump. The highest
card played of the suit led wins the trick, and trumps win all other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
suits. The side winning the trick takes it in and arranges it just
as at Whist. Before leading for the next trick all cards which
have been uncovered are turned face up. If any person has
played his down card he will have no card to turn up, none having
been uncovered. The cards cannot under any circumstances be
shifted from their original positions. If a player has five cards
face up, covering five cards face down, he cannot shift one of the
exposed cards to the empty sixth place, and uncover another card.
All covering cards must be got rid of in the course of play.</p>

<p><i><b>PENALTIES</b></i> for revokes, cards led out of turn, etc., are
the same as at Whist.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> As in Whist, the object is to
win tricks, all above six counting one point toward game. Five,
seven, or ten points may be made the game, at the option of the
players, but ten is the usual number. Honours are not counted
except by agreement.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> It is usual to play for so much a point or a game.
If points are played, the loser’s score must be deducted from the
winner’s, and the difference is the value of the game won.</p>

<p><i><b>WHEN THREE PLAY</b></i>, eight cards are dealt to each person,
and arranged face down; then eight more, arranged face up,
and then one to each for down cards. There are no partnerships;
each plays for himself against the others.</p>

<p><i><b>WHEN TWO PLAY</b></i>, twelve cards are dealt to each player,
and arranged face down; then twelve more, arranged face up, and
then two down cards to each. It is usual to deal all the cards two
at a time.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> Chinese Whist
very closely resembles Dummy, and the chief element of success is
the skilful use of tenace. Memory also plays an important part, it
being especially necessary to remember what cards are still unplayed
in each suit. While the down cards are held a player cannot
be sure of taking a trick by leading a card higher than any his
adversary has exposed, because one of the down cards may be
better. If a player is short of trumps, but has as many and better
than those of his adversary, it is often good play to lead and draw
the weaker trumps before the adversary turns up higher ones to
protect them. For instance: one player may have 10 8, and his
adversary the 9 alone. If the 10 is led the 9 will probably be
caught, unless one of the adverse down cards is better. If the 10
is not led the adversary may turn up an honour, and will then have
major tenace over the 10 and 8.</p>

<p>The end game always offers some interesting problems for
solution by the expert in tenace position, and in placing the lead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<h3>WHIST FAMILY LAWS.</h3>

<p>While the code of laws drawn up by the American Whist
League, and finally approved and adopted at the Third Congress,
[in Chicago, June 20th to 24th, 1893,] refers exclusively to
the parent game of Whist, its general provisions equally apply to
all members of the whist family of games. The author believes it
will save much repetition and confusion to interlineate the exceptions
which are necessary in order to cover the special features of
such important variations as Boston, Cayenne, and Solo Whist.
Where no exceptions are made, the law applies equally to these
games and to Whist. The unnumbered paragraphs show the inserted
laws.</p>

<p>It is a common practice for the framers of laws to insert rules
which are simply descriptive of the manner of play. The author
believes in adhering to the proper definition of a law, which is a
rule carrying with it some penalty for its infraction, or defining the
rights of individual players. Such a statement as that the Dummy
player may not overlook his adversary’s hand is not a law, because
there is no penalty if he does so.</p>

<p>The author is not responsible for the peculiar grammar employed
in both the American and English Laws.</p>

<h4>THE GAME.</h4>

<p>1. A game consists of seven points, each trick above six counting
one. The value of the game is determined by deducting the
losers’ score from seven.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i>, the game is finished in twelve deals.</p>

<p>In <i><b>Cayenne</b></i>, a game consists of ten points, each trick
above six counting towards game according to the table of
values. Honours and Slams also count towards game. Every
hand must be played out, and all points made in excess of
the ten required to win the game are counted on the next
game; so that it is possible to win two or three games in
one hand. In Nullo, every trick over the book is counted by
the adversaries. Players cannot count out by honours alone;
they must win the odd trick or stop at the score of nine.
If one side goes out by cards, the other cannot score honours.
The rubber is won by the side that first wins four games of
ten points each. The value of the rubber is determined by
adding 8 points to the winners’ score for tricks, honours, and
slams, and then deducting the score of the losers.</p>

<p>In <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, the game is complete in one deal, and
the value of it is determined by the player’s success or failure
in his undertaking, and must be settled for at the end of the
hand, according to the table of payments.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<h4>FORMING THE TABLE.</h4>

<p>2. Those first in the room have the preference. If, by reason
of two or more arriving at the same time, more than four assemble,
the preference among the last comers is determined by cutting,
a lower cut giving the preference over all cutting higher. A complete
table consists of six; the four having the preference play.
Partners are determined by cutting; the highest two play against
the lowest two; the lowest deals and has the choice of seats and
cards.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i> and in <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, a table is complete with
four players. In cutting for positions at the table, the lowest
has the choice of seats and cards, and the two highest sit opposite
each other.</p>

</div>

<p>3. If two players cut intermediate cards of equal value, they
cut again; the lower of the new cut plays with the original lowest.</p>

<p>4. If three players cut cards of equal value, they cut again. If
the fourth has cut the highest card, the two lowest of the new cut
are partners, and the lowest deals. If the fourth has cut the lowest
card, he deals, and the two highest of the new cut are partners.</p>

<p>5. At the end of a game, if there are more than four belonging
to the table, a sufficient number of the players retire to admit those
awaiting their turn to play. In determining which players remain
in, those who have played a less number of consecutive games
have the preference over all who have played a greater number;
between two or more who have played an equal number, the
preference is determined by cutting, a lower cut giving the preference
over all cutting higher.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i>, <i><b>Cayenne</b></i>, and <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, at the end of a
game a new table must be formed, those already in having no
preference over fresh candidates.</p>

</div>

<p>6. To entitle one to enter a table, he must declare his intention
to do so before any one of the players has cut for the purpose of
commencing a new game or of cutting out.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i>, <i><b>Cayenne</b></i>, and <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, this rule does
not apply.</p>

</div>

<h4>CUTTING.</h4>

<p>7. In cutting, the ace is the lowest card. All must cut from
the same pack. If a player exposes more than one card, he must
cut again. Drawing cards from the outspread pack may be resorted
to in place of cutting.</p>

<h4>SHUFFLING.</h4>

<p>8. Before every deal, the cards must be shuffled. When two
packs are used, the dealer’s partner must collect and shuffle the
cards for the ensuing deal and place them at his right hand. In
all cases the dealer may shuffle last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i> and in <i><b>Cayenne</b></i>, two packs must be used;
and in Boston there must be no shuffling of either pack after
the first deal.</p>

</div>

<p>9. A pack must not be shuffled during the play of a hand, nor
so as to expose the face of any card.</p>

<h4>CUTTING TO THE DEALER.</h4>

<p>10. The dealer must present the pack to his right hand adversary
to be cut; the adversary must take a portion from the top of
the pack and place it toward the dealer; at least four cards must
be left in each packet; the dealer must reunite the packets by
placing the one not removed in cutting upon the other.</p>

<p>11. If, in cutting or reuniting the separate packets, a card is
exposed, the pack must be reshuffled by the dealer, and cut again;
if there is any confusion of the cards, or doubt as to the place where
the pack was separated, there must be a new cut.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i>, the pack must be cut again; but not shuffled.</p>

</div>

<p>12. If the dealer reshuffles the pack after it has been properly
cut, he loses his deal.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i>, <i><b>Cayenne</b></i>, and <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, the misdealer
must deal again.</p>

</div>

<h4>DEALING.</h4>

<p>13. When the pack has been properly cut and reunited, the
dealer must distribute the cards, one at a time, to each player in
regular rotation, beginning at his left. The last, which is the
trump card, must be turned up before the dealer. At the end of
the hand, or when the deal is lost, the deal passes to the player
next to the dealer on his left, and so on to each in turn.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, the cards are distributed three at a time
until only four remain in the pack. These are dealt one at
a time, and the last turned up for trump.</p>

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i> and in <i><b>Cayenne</b></i>, the cards are dealt four at a
time for two rounds, and then five at a time. No trump is
turned. After the cards have been dealt the player opposite
the dealer presents the still pack to be cut by the player on
the dealer’s left, and the top card of the portion left on the
table is turned up.</p>

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i>, <i><b>Cayenne</b></i>, or <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, the deal is never
lost. The same dealer deals again with the same pack.</p>

</div>

<p>14. There must be a new deal by the same dealer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. If any card except the last is faced in the pack.</p>

<p>II. If, during the deal or during the play of the hand, the
pack is proved incorrect or imperfect; but any prior
score made with that pack shall stand.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>15. If, during the deal, a card is exposed, the side not in fault
may demand a new deal, provided neither of that side has touched
a card. If a new deal does not take place, the exposed card is not
liable to be called.</p>

<p>16. Any one dealing out of turn, or with his adversaries’ pack,
may be stopped before the trump card is turned, after which the
deal is valid, and the packs, if changed, so remain.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i> and <i><b>Cayenne</b></i>, the dealer must be stopped before
the last card is dealt.</p>

</div>

<h4>MISDEALING.</h4>

<p>17. It is a misdeal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. If the dealer omits to have the pack cut, and his adversaries
discover the error before the trump card is
turned, and before looking at any of their cards.</p>

<p>II. If he deals a card incorrectly, and fails to correct the
error before dealing another.</p>

<p>III. If he counts the cards on the table or in the remainder
of the pack.</p>

<p>IV. If, having a perfect pack, he does not deal to each
player the proper number of cards, and the error is
discovered before all have played to the first trick.</p>

<p>V. If he looks at the trump card before the deal is completed.</p>

<p>VI. If he places the trump card face downward upon
his own or any other player’s cards.</p>

</div>

<p>A misdeal loses the deal, unless, during the deal, either of the
adversaries touches a card or in any other manner interrupts the
dealer.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i>, <i><b>Cayenne</b></i>, and <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, the misdealer
deals again with the same cards. In Boston he forfeits a red
counter to the pool for his error.</p>

</div>

<h4>THE TRUMP CARD.</h4>

<p>18. The dealer must leave the trump card face upward on the
table until it is his turn to play to the first trick; if it is left on the
table until after the second trick has been turned and quitted, it is
liable to be called. After it has been lawfully taken up, it must
not be named, and any player naming it is liable to have his highest
or his lowest trump called by either adversary. A player may,
however, ask what the trump suit is.</p>

<p>This law does not apply to Boston, or Cayenne.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i> and in <i><b>Cayenne</b></i>, no trump is turned, but a
card is cut from the still pack to determine the rank of the
suits. See Law 13.</p>

<p>In <i><b>Cayenne</b></i>, the trump suit must be named by the dealer
or his partner after they have examined their cards. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
dealer has the first say, and he may select any of the four suits,
or he may announce “grand,” playing for the tricks without
any trump suit. In Cayenne, he may announce “nullo,” playing
to take as few tricks as possible, there being no trump suit.
If the dealer makes his choice, his partner must abide by it;
but if the dealer has not a hand to justify him in deciding, he
may leave the choice to his partner, who must decide. A
declaration once made cannot be changed.</p>

</div>

<h4>IRREGULARITIES IN THE HANDS.</h4>

<p>19. If, at any time after all have played to the first trick, the
pack being perfect, a player is found to have either more or less
than his correct number of cards and his adversaries have their
right number, the latter, upon the discovery of such surplus or deficiency,
may consult and shall have the choice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. To have a new deal; or</p>

<p>II. To have the hand played out, in which case the surplus
or missing card or cards are not taken into
account.</p>

</div>

<p>If either of the adversaries also has more or less than his correct
number, there must be a new deal.</p>

<p>If any player has a surplus card by reason of an omission to
play to a trick, his adversaries can exercise the foregoing privilege
only after he has played to the trick following the one in which
such omission occurred.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i>, if at any time it is discovered that a player
opposed to the bidder has <i><b>less</b></i> than his proper number of
cards, whether through the fault of the dealer, or through
having played more than one card to a trick, he and his partners
must each pay the bidder for his bid and all over-tricks.
If the bidder has <i><b>less</b></i> than his proper number of cards, he is
put in for one trick at least, and his adversaries may demand
the hand to be played out to put him in for over-tricks.
In Misère Partout, any player having <i><b>less</b></i> than his proper
number of cards forfeits five red counters to each of the other
players, and the hands are abandoned. If any player has
<i><b>more</b></i> than the proper number of cards, it is a misdeal, and
the misdealer deals again, after forfeiting one red counter to
the pool.</p>

<p>In <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, the deal stands good. Should the player
with the incorrect number of cards be the caller or his partner,
the hand must be played out. Should the caller make good
his proposition, he neither receives nor pays on that hand. If
he fails, he must pay. Should the player with the defective
hand be the adversary of the caller, he and his partners must
pay the stakes on that hand, which may then be abandoned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Should two players have an incorrect number of cards, one of
them being the caller, there must be a new deal.</p>

</div>

<h4>CARDS LIABLE TO BE CALLED.</h4>

<p>20. The following cards are liable to be called by either adversary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. Every card faced upon the table otherwise than in the
regular course of play, but not including a card led
out of turn.</p>

<p>II. Every card thrown with the one led or played to the
current trick. The player must indicate the one
led or played.</p>

<p>III. Every card so held by a player that his partner sees
any portion of its face.</p>

<p>IV. All the cards in a hand lowered or shown by a player
so that his partner sees more than one card of it.</p>

<p>V. Every card named by the player holding it.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i> and <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i> there are no penalties for cards
exposed by the single player, because he has no partner to take
advantage of the information.</p>

</div>

<p>21. All cards liable to be called must be placed and left face
upwards on the table. A player must lead or play them when
called, provided he can do so without revoking. The call may be
repeated at each trick until the card is played. A player cannot
be prevented from leading or playing a card liable to be called; if
he can get rid of it in the course of play, no penalty remains.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i> and in <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, if the exposed card is a
trump, the owner may be called upon by his adversary not
to use it for ruffing. If the suit of the exposed card is led,
whether trump or not, the adversary may demand that the
card be played or not played; or that the highest or lowest of
the suit be played. If the owner of the exposed card has no
other of the suit, the penalty is paid.</p>

<p>Penalties must be exacted by players in their proper turn, or
the right to exact them is lost. For instance: In Solo Whist,
A is the proposer, B the acceptor, and B has an exposed card
in front of him. When Y plays he should say whether or
not he wishes to call the exposed card. If he says nothing, B
must await Z’s decision.</p>

</div>

<p>22. If a player leads a card better than any his adversaries hold
of the suit, and then leads one or more other cards without waiting
for his partner to play, the latter may be called upon by either
adversary to take the first trick, and the other cards thus improperly
played are liable to be called; it makes no difference whether
he plays them one after the other, or throws them all on the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
together, after the first card is played, the others are liable to be
called.</p>

<p>23. A player having a card liable to be called must not play
another until the adversaries have stated whether or not they wish
to call the card liable to the penalty. If he plays another card
without awaiting the decision of the adversaries, such other card
also is liable to be called.</p>

<h4>LEADING OUT OF TURN.</h4>

<p>24. If any player leads out of turn, a suit may be called from
him or his partner, the first time it is the turn of either of them to
lead. The penalty can be enforced only by the adversary on the
right of the player from whom a suit can be lawfully called.</p>

<p>If a player, so called on to lead a suit, has none of it, or if all
have played to the false lead, no penalty can be enforced. If all
have not played to the trick, the cards erroneously played to such
false lead are not liable to be called and must be taken back.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i>, if the adversary of the bidder leads out of turn,
and the bidder has not played to the trick, the latter may call
a suit from the player whose proper turn it is to lead; or, if
it is the bidder’s own lead, he may call a suit when next the
adversaries obtain the lead; or he may claim the card played
in error as an exposed card. If the bidder has played to the
trick the error cannot be rectified. Should the bidder lead out
of turn, and the player on his left follow the erroneous lead,
the error cannot be corrected.</p>

<p>In Misères, a lead out of turn by the bidder’s adversary immediately
loses the game, but there is no penalty for leading
out of turn in Misère Partout.</p>

</div>

<h4>PLAYING OUT OF TURN.</h4>

<p>25. If the third hand plays before the second, the fourth hand
also may play before the second.</p>

<p>26. If the third hand has not played, and the fourth hand plays
before the second, the latter may be called upon by the third hand
to play his highest or lowest card of the suit led or, if he has none,
to trump or not to trump the trick.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i>, and in <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, should an adversary of
the single player play out of turn, the bidder may call upon
the adversary who has not played to play his highest or lowest
of the suit led, or to win or not to win the trick. If the
adversary of a Misère player leads or plays out of turn, the
bidder may immediately claim the stakes. In Solo Whist,
the individual player in fault must pay for himself and for his
partners.</p>

</div>

<h4>ABANDONED HANDS.</h4>

<p>27. If all four players throw their cards on the table, face upwards,
no further play of that hand is permitted. The result of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the hand, as then claimed or admitted, is established, provided
that, if a revoke is discovered, the revoke penalty attaches.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, should the bidder abandon his hand, he
and his partner, if any, must pay the stakes and settle for all
over-tricks as if they had lost all the remaining tricks. If
a player, not the bidder, abandons his hand, his partner or
partners may demand the hand to be played out with the
abandoned hand exposed, and liable to be called by the adversary.
If they defeat the call they win nothing, but the
player who abandoned his hand must pay the caller just as if
he had been successful. If the partner or partners of the
exposed hand lose, they must pay their share of the losses.</p>

</div>

<h4>REVOKING.</h4>

<p>28. A revoke is a renounce in error, not corrected in time. A
player renounces in error, when, holding one or more cards of the
suit led, he plays a card of a different suit.</p>

<p>A renounce in error may be corrected by the player making it,
before the trick in which it occurs has been turned and quitted, unless
either he or his partner, whether in his right turn or otherwise,
has led or played to the following trick.</p>

<p>29. If a player corrects his mistake in time to save a revoke,
the card improperly played by him is liable to be called; any player
or players, who have played after him, may withdraw their cards
and substitute others; the cards so withdrawn are not liable to be
called.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i>, if the bidder revokes and corrects himself in
time, there is no penalty unless an adversary has played after
him, in which case the bidder’s card may be claimed as exposed.
The player who followed him may then amend his
play. If a player opposed to the bidder discovers and corrects
a revoke made by himself or any of his partners, the bidder
may either claim the card played in error as exposed, or
may call on the revoking player for his highest or lowest of
the suit led.</p>

</div>

<p>30. The penalty for revoking is the transfer of two tricks from
the revoking side to their adversaries; it can be enforced for as
many revokes as occur during the hand. The revoking side cannot
win the game in that hand; if both sides revoke, neither can
win the game in that hand.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Cayenne</b></i> and <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, as a penalty for a revoke,
the adversaries of the revoking player may take from him three
tricks; or may deduct the value of three tricks from his score;
or may add the value of three tricks to their own score.
The revoking players cannot score slams or game that hand.
All slams must be made independently of the revoke penalty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i>, the penalty for a revoke on the part of the
bidder is that he is put in for one trick, and must pay four
red counters into the next pool. Should an adversary of the
bidder revoke, he must pay four red counters into the next
pool, and he and his partners must pay the bidder as if he had
been successful. On the discovery of a revoke in Boston the
hands are usually abandoned; but the cards should be shown
to the table, in order that each player may be satisfied that no
other revoke has been made. A player revoking in Misère
Partout pays five red counters to each of his adversaries and
the hands are then abandoned.</p>

</div>

<p>31. The revoking player and his partner may require the hand
in which the revoke has been made, to be played out, and score
all points made by them up to the score of six.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i>, the hands are abandoned after the revoke is
claimed and proved.</p>

<p>In <i><b>Cayenne</b></i>, the revoking players must stop at nine.</p>

<p>In <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, the revoking players must pay all the red
counters involved in the call, whether they win or lose, but
they may play the hand out to save over-tricks. If the caller
or his partner revokes they must jointly pay the losses involved;
but if an adversary of the caller revokes, he must
individually pay the entire loss unless he can show that the
callers would have won in spite of the revoke. Should he be
able to do this, his partners must stand their share of the
losses, but the revoking player must individually pay for the
three tricks taken as the revoke penalty. If the single player
revokes, either on solo or abundance, he loses the red counters
involved in any case, but may play the hand out to save over-tricks.
If the single player in a misère or a slam revokes, the
hand is abandoned and he must pay the stakes. If an adversary
of a misère or a slam revokes, he must individually
pay the whole stakes.</p>

</div>

<p>32. At the end of a hand, the claimants of a revoke may search
all the tricks. If the cards have been mixed, the claim may be
urged and proved, if possible; but no proof is necessary and the
revoke is established, if, after it has been claimed, the accused
player or his partner mixes the cards before they have been examined
to the satisfaction of the adversaries.</p>

<p>33. The revoke can be claimed at any time before the cards
have been presented and cut for the following deal, but not thereafter.</p>

<h4>MISCELLANEOUS.</h4>

<p>34. Any one, during the play of a trick and before the cards
have been touched for the purpose of gathering them together,
may demand that the players draw their cards.</p>

<p>35. If any one, prior to his partner playing, calls attention in
any manner to the trick or to the score, the adversary last to play to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the trick may require the offender’s partner to play his highest or
lowest of the suit led or, if he has none, to trump or not to trump
the trick.</p>

<p>36. If any player says “I can win the rest,” “The rest are
ours,” “We have the game,” or words to that effect, his partner’s
cards must be laid upon the table and are liable to be called.</p>

<p>37. When a trick has been turned and quitted, it must not again
be seen until after the hand has been played. A violation of this
law subjects the offender’s side to the same penalty as in case of a
lead out of turn.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i>, <i><b>Cayenne</b></i>, and <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, it is still the
custom to permit looking at the last trick, except in Misères.
The penalty in a misère game is the same as for a lead out of
turn.</p>

</div>

<p>38. If a player is lawfully called upon to play the highest or
lowest of a suit, or to trump or not to trump a trick, or to lead a
suit, and unnecessarily fails to comply, he is liable to the same
penalty as if he had revoked.</p>

<p>39. In all cases where a penalty has been incurred, the offender
must await the decision of the adversaries. If either of them,
with or without his partner’s consent, demands a penalty to which
they are entitled, such decision is final. If the wrong adversary demands
a penalty, or a wrong penalty is demanded, none can be
enforced.</p>

<p class="tb">The following rules belong to the established code of Whist
Etiquette. They are formulated with a view to discourage and repress
certain improprieties of conduct, therein pointed out, which
are not reached by the laws. The courtesy which marks the intercourse
of gentlemen will regulate other more obvious cases.</p>

<p>1. No conversation should be indulged in during the play, except
such as is allowed by the laws of the game.</p>

<p>2. No player should in any manner whatsoever give any intimation
as to the state of his hand or of the game, or of approval
or disapproval of a play.</p>

<p>3. No player should lead until the preceding trick is turned
and quitted.</p>

<p>4. No player should, after having led a winning card, draw a
card from his hand for another lead until his partner has played to
the current trick.</p>

<p>5. No player should play a card in any manner so as to call
particular attention to it, nor should he demand that the cards be
placed in order to attract the attention of his partner.</p>

<p>6. No player should purposely incur a penalty because he is
willing to pay it, nor should he make a second revoke in order to
conceal one previously made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>7. No player should take advantage of information imparted by
his partner through a breach of etiquette.</p>

<p>8. No player should object to referring a disputed question of
fact to a bystander who professes himself uninterested in the result
of the game, and able to decide the question.</p>

<p>9. Bystanders should not in any manner call attention to, or
give any intimation concerning the play or the state of the game,
during the play of a hand. They should not look over the hand of
a player without his permission; nor should they walk round the
table to look at the different hands.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h4>ERRONEOUS SCORES.</h4>

<p>Any error in the trick score may be corrected before the
last card has been dealt in the following deal; or if the error
occurs in the last hand of a game or rubber, it may be corrected
before the score is agreed to. Errors in other scores
may be corrected at any time before the final score of the
game or rubber is agreed to.</p>

<h4>BIDDING.</h4>

<p>In <i><b>Boston</b></i>, or <i><b>Solo Whist</b></i>, any player making a bid must
stand by it, and either play or pay. Should he make a bid in
error and correct himself, he must stand by the first bid unless
he is over-called, when he may either amend his bid or pass.</p>

</div>

<h3>ENGLISH WHIST LAWS.</h3>

<h4>THE RUBBER.</h4>

<p>1. The rubber is the best of three games. If the first two
games are won by the same players, the third game is not played.</p>

<h4>SCORING.</h4>

<p>2. A game consists of five points. Each trick, above six,
counts one point.</p>

<p>3. Honours, <i>i.e.</i>, Ace, King, Queen, and Knave of trumps, are
thus reckoned:</p>

<p>If a player and his partner, either separately or conjointly, hold&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. The four honours, they score four points.</p>

<p>II. Any three honours, they score two points.</p>

<p>III. Only two honours, they do not score.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Those players who, at the commencement of a deal, are at
the score of four, cannot score honours.</p>

<p>5. The penalty for a revoke (<i>see</i> Law 72) takes precedence of
all other scores. Tricks score next. Honours last.</p>

<p>6. Honours, unless claimed before the trump card of the following
deal is turned up, cannot be scored.</p>

<p>7. To score honours is not sufficient; they must be called at
the end of the hand; if so called, they may be scored at any time
during the game.</p>

<p>8. The winners gain&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. A treble, or game of three points, when their adversaries
have not scored.</p>

<p>II. A double, or game of two points, when their adversaries
have scored less than three.</p>

<p>III. A single, or game of one point, when their adversaries
have scored three or four.</p>

</div>

<p>9. The winners of the rubber gain two points (commonly called
the rubber points), in addition to the value of their games.</p>

<p>10. Should the rubber have consisted of three games, the value
of the losers’ game is deducted from the gross number of points
gained by their opponents.</p>

<p>11. If an erroneous score be proved, such mistake can be corrected
prior to the conclusion of the game in which it occurred,
and such game is not concluded until the trump card of the following
deal has been turned up.</p>

<p>12. If an erroneous score, affecting the amount of the rubber,
be proved, such mistake can be rectified at any time during the
rubber.</p>

<h4>CUTTING.</h4>

<p>13. The Ace is the lowest card.</p>

<p>14. In all cases, every one must cut from the same pack.</p>

<p>15. Should a player expose more than one card, he must cut
again.</p>

<h4>FORMATION OF TABLE.</h4>

<p>16. If there are more than four candidates, the players are
selected by cutting; those first in the room having the preference.
The four who cut the lowest cards play first, and cut again to
decide on partners; the two lowest play against the two highest;
the lowest is the dealer, who has choice of cards and seats, and,
having once made his selection, must abide by it.</p>

<p>17. When there are more than six candidates, those who cut
the two next lowest cards belong to the table, which is complete
with six players; on the retirement of one of those six players,
the candidate who cut the next lowest card has a prior right to
any aftercomer to enter the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<h4>CUTTING CARDS OF EQUAL VALUE.</h4>

<p>18. Two players cutting cards of equal value, unless such
cards are the two highest, cut again; should they be the two
lowest, a fresh cut is necessary to decide which of those two deals.</p>

<p>19. Three players cutting cards of equal value cut again;
should the fourth (or remaining) card be the highest, the two
lowest of the new cut are partners, the lower of those two the
dealer; should the fourth card be the lowest, the two highest are
partners, the original lowest the dealer.</p>

<h4>CUTTING OUT.</h4>

<p>20. At the end of a rubber, should admission be claimed by
any one, or by two candidates, he who has, or they who have,
played a greater number of consecutive rubbers than the others
is, or are, out; but when all have played the same number, they
must cut to decide upon the outgoers; the highest are out.</p>

<h4>ENTRY AND RE-ENTRY.</h4>

<p>21. A candidate wishing to enter a table must declare such intention
prior to any of the players having cut a card, either for
the purpose of commencing a fresh rubber or of cutting out.</p>

<p>22. In the formation of fresh tables, those candidates who
have neither belonged to nor played at any other table have the
prior right of entry; the others decide their right of admission by
cutting.</p>

<p>23. Any one quitting a table prior to the conclusion of a rubber
may, with consent of the other three players, appoint a substitute
in his absence during that rubber.</p>

<p>24. A player cutting into one table, whilst belonging to
another, loses his right of re-entry into that latter, and takes his
chance of cutting in, as if he were a fresh candidate.</p>

<p>25. If any one break up a table, the remaining players have
the prior right to him of entry into any other, and should there
not be sufficient vacancies at such other table to admit all those
candidates, they settle their precedence by cutting.</p>

<h4>SHUFFLING</h4>

<p>26. The pack must neither be shuffled below the table nor so
that the face of any card be seen.</p>

<p>27. The pack must not be shuffled during the play of the hand.</p>

<p>28. A pack, having been played with, must neither be shuffled
by dealing it into packets, nor across the table.</p>

<p>29. Each player has a right to shuffle, once only, except as provided
by Rule 32, prior to a deal, after a false cut [<i>see</i> Law 34], or
when a new deal [<i>see</i> Law 37] has occurred.</p>

<p>30. The dealer’s partner must collect the cards for the ensuing
deal, and has the first right to shuffle that pack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>31. Each player after shuffling must place the cards properly
collected, and face downwards, to the left of the player about
to deal.</p>

<p>32. The dealer has always the right to shuffle last; but should
a card or cards be seen during his shuffling, or whilst giving the
pack to be cut, he may be compelled to reshuffle.</p>

<h4>THE DEAL.</h4>

<p>33. Each player deals in his turn; the right of dealing goes to
the left.</p>

<p>34. The player on the dealer’s right cuts the pack, and, in dividing
it, must not leave fewer than four cards in either packet; if in
cutting, or in replacing one of the two packets on the other, a card
be exposed, or if there be any confusion of the cards, or a doubt as
to the exact place in which the pack was divided, there must be a
fresh cut.</p>

<p>35. When a player, whose duty it is to cut, has once separated
the pack, he cannot alter his intention; he can neither reshuffle
nor recut the cards.</p>

<p>36. When the pack is cut, should the dealer shuffle the cards, he
loses his deal.</p>

<h4>A NEW DEAL.</h4>

<p>37. There must be a new deal&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. If during a deal, or during the play of a hand, the
pack be proved incorrect or imperfect.</p>

<p>II. If any card, excepting the last, be faced in the pack.</p>

</div>

<p>38. If, whilst dealing, a card be exposed by the dealer or his
partner, should neither of the adversaries have touched the cards,
the latter can claim a new deal; a card exposed by either adversary
gives that claim to the dealer, provided that his partner has
not touched a card; if a new deal does not take place, the exposed
card cannot be called.</p>

<p>39. If, during dealing, a player touch any of his cards, the
adversaries may do the same, without losing their privilege of
claiming a new deal, should chance give them such option.</p>

<p>40. If, in dealing, one of the last cards be exposed, and the
dealer turn up the trump before there is reasonable time for his
adversaries to decide as to a fresh deal, they do not thereby lose
their privilege.</p>

<p>41. If a player, whilst dealing, look at the trump card, his
adversaries have a right to see it, and may exact a new deal.</p>

<p>42. If a player take into the hand dealt to him a card belonging
to the other pack, the adversaries, on discovery of the error,
may decide whether they will have a fresh deal or not.</p>

<h4>A MISDEAL.</h4>

<p>43. A misdeal loses the deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>44. It is a misdeal&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. Unless the cards are dealt into four packets, one at
a time in regular rotation, beginning with the
player to the dealer’s left.</p>

<p>II. Should the dealer place the last (<i>i.e.</i>, the trump) card,
face downwards, on his own, or any other pack.</p>

<p>III. Should the trump card not come in its regular order
to the dealer; but he does not lose his deal if the
pack be proved imperfect.</p>

<p>IV. Should a player have fourteen cards, and either of
the other three less than thirteen.</p>

<p>V. Should the dealer, under an impression that he has
made a mistake, either count the cards on the
table or the remainder of the pack.</p>

<p>VI. Should the dealer deal two cards at once, or two
cards to the same hand, and then deal a third;
but if, prior to dealing that third card, the dealer
can, by altering the position of one card only,
rectify such error, he may do so, except as provided
by the second paragraph of this Law.</p>

<p>VII. Should the dealer omit to have the pack cut to him,
and the adversaries discover the error, prior to the
trump card being turned up, and before looking
at their cards, but not after having done so.</p>

</div>

<p>45. A misdeal does not lose the deal if, during the dealing,
either of the adversaries touch the cards prior to the dealer’s partner
having done so; but should the latter have first interfered with
the cards, notwithstanding either or both of the adversaries have
subsequently done the same, the deal is lost.</p>

<p>46. Should three players have their right number of cards&mdash;the
fourth have less than thirteen, and not discover such deficiency
until he has played any of his cards, the deal stands good; should
he have played, he is as answerable for any revoke he may have
made as if the missing card, or cards, had been in his hand; he
may search the other pack for it, or them.</p>

<p>47. If a pack, during or after a rubber, be proved incorrect or
imperfect, such proof does not alter any past score, game, or rubber;
that hand in which the imperfection was detected is null and void;
the dealer deals again.</p>

<p>48. Any one dealing out of turn, or with the adversary’s cards,
may be stopped before the trump card is turned up, after which
the game must proceed as if no mistake had been made.</p>

<p>49. A player can neither shuffle, cut, nor deal for his partner,
without the permission of his opponents.</p>

<p>50. If the adversaries interrupt a dealer whilst dealing, either
by questioning the score or asserting that it is not his deal, and fail
to establish such claim, should a misdeal occur, he may deal again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>51. Should a player take his partner’s deal and misdeal, the
latter is liable to the usual penalty, and the adversary next in rotation
to the player who ought to have dealt then deals.</p>

<h4>THE TRUMP CARD.</h4>

<p>52. The dealer, when it is his turn to play to the first trick,
should take the trump card into his hand; if left on the table after
the first trick be turned and quitted, it is liable to be called; his
partner may at any time remind him of the liability.</p>

<p>53. After the dealer has taken the trump card into his hand, it
cannot be asked for; a player naming it at any time during the
play of that hand is liable to have his highest or lowest trump
called.</p>

<p>54. If the dealer take the trump card into his hand before it is
his turn to play, he may be desired to lay it on the table; should
he show a wrong card, this card may be called, as also a second,
a third, etc., until the trump card be produced.</p>

<p>55. If the dealer declare himself unable to recollect the trump
card, his highest or lowest trump may be called at any time during
that hand, and unless it cause him to revoke, must be played; the
call may be repeated, but not changed, <i>i.e.</i>, from highest to lowest,
or <i>vice versa</i>, until such card is played.</p>

<h4>CARDS LIABLE TO BE CALLED.</h4>

<p>56. All exposed cards are liable to be called, and must be left
on the table; but a card is not an exposed card when dropped on
the floor, or elsewhere below the table. The following are exposed
cards:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. Two or more cards played at once.</p>

<p>II. Any card dropped with its face upward, or in any way
exposed on or above the table, even though snatched
up so quickly that no one can name it.</p>

</div>

<p>57. If any one play to an imperfect trick the best card on the
table, or lead one which is a winning card as against his adversaries,
and then lead again, or play several such winning cards, one
after the other, without waiting for his partner to play, the latter
may be called on to win, if he can, the first or any other of those
tricks, and the other cards thus improperly played are exposed
cards.</p>

<p>58. If a player, or players, under the impression that the game
is lost&mdash;or won&mdash;or for other reasons&mdash;throw his or their cards on
the table face upward, such cards are exposed, and liable to be
called, each player’s by the adversary; but should one player alone
retain his hand, he cannot be forced to abandon it.</p>

<p>59. If all four players throw their cards on the table face upward,
the hands are abandoned; and no one can again take up
his cards. Should this general exhibition show that the game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
might have been saved, or won, neither claim can be entertained,
unless a revoke be established. The revoking players are then
liable to the following penalties: they cannot under any circumstances
win the game by the result of that hand, and the adversaries
may add three to their score, or deduct three from that of
the revoking players.</p>

<p>60. A card detached from the rest of the hand so as to be
named is liable to be called; but should the adversary name a
wrong card, he is liable to have a suit called when he or his partner
have the lead.</p>

<p>61. If a player who has rendered himself liable to have the
highest or lowest of a suit called, fail to play as desired, or if when
called on to lead one suit he lead another, having in his hand one
or more cards of that suit demanded, he incurs the penalty of a
revoke.</p>

<p>62. If any player lead out of turn, his adversaries may either
call the card erroneously led, or may call a suit from him or his
partner when it is next the turn of either of them to lead.</p>

<p>63. If any player lead out of turn, and the three others have followed
him, the trick is complete, and the error cannot be rectified;
but if only the second, or the second and third, have played to the
false lead, their cards, on discovery of the mistake, are taken back;
there is no penalty against any one, excepting the original offender,
whose card may be called, or he, or his partner, when either of
them has next the lead, may be compelled to play any suit demanded
by the adversaries.</p>

<p>64. In no case can a player be compelled to play a card which
would oblige him to revoke.</p>

<p>65. The call of a card may be repeated until such card has been
played.</p>

<p>66. If a player called on to lead a suit have none of it, the
penalty is paid.</p>

<h4>CARDS PLAYED IN ERROR, OR NOT PLAYED TO A TRICK.</h4>

<p>67. If the third hand play before the second, the fourth hand
may play before his partner.</p>

<p>68. Should the third hand not have played, and the fourth play
before his partner, the latter may be called on to win, or not to
win the trick.</p>

<p>69. If any one omit playing to a former trick, and such error be
not discovered until he has played to the next, the adversaries
may claim a new deal; should they decide that the deal stand
good, the surplus card at the end of the hand is considered to have
been played to the imperfect trick, but does not constitute a revoke
therein.</p>

<p>70. If any one play two cards to the same trick, or mix his
trump, or other card, with a trick to which it does not properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
belong, and the mistake be not discovered until the hand is played
out, he is answerable for all consequent revokes he may have
made. If, during the play of the hand, the error be detected, the
tricks may be counted face downward, in order to ascertain
whether there be among them a card too many; should this be
the case, they may be searched, and the card restored; the player
is, however, liable for all revokes which he may have meanwhile
made.</p>

<h4>THE REVOKE.</h4>

<p>71. Is when a player, holding one or more cards of the suit led,
plays a card of a different suit.</p>

<p>72. The penalty for a revoke&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. Is at the option of the adversaries, who at the end of
the hand may either take three tricks from the
revoking player or deduct three points from his
score, or add three to their own score;</p>

<p>II. Can be claimed for as many revokes as occur during
the hand;</p>

<p>III. Is applicable only to the score of the game in which
it occurs;</p>

<p>IV. Cannot be divided, <i>i.e.</i>, a player cannot add one or
two to his own score and deduct one or two from
the revoking player;</p>

<p>V. Takes precedence of every other score&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, the
claimants two, their opponents nothing; the former
add three to their score, and thereby win a treble
game, even should the latter have made thirteen
tricks, and held four honours.</p>

</div>

<p>73. A revoke is established if the trick in which it occur be
turned and quitted, <i>i.e.</i>, the hand removed from that trick after it
has been turned face downward on the table, or if either the revoking
player or his partner, whether in his right turn or otherwise,
lead or play to the following trick.</p>

<p>74. A player may ask his partner whether he has not a card of
the suit which he has renounced; should the question be asked before
the trick is turned and quitted, subsequent turning and quitting
does not establish the revoke, and the error may be corrected,
unless the question be answered in the negative, or unless the revoking
player or his partner have led or played to the following
trick.</p>

<p>75. At the end of the hand, the claimants of a revoke may
search all the tricks.</p>

<p>76. If a player discover his mistake in time to save a revoke, the
adversaries, whenever they think fit, may call the card thus
played in error, or may require him to play his highest or lowest
card to that trick in which he has renounced; any player or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
players who have played after him may withdraw their cards and
substitute others: the cards withdrawn are not liable to be called.</p>

<p>77. If a revoke be claimed, and the accused player or his partner
mix the cards before they have been sufficiently examined by
the adversaries, the revoke is established. The mixing of the
cards only renders the proof of a revoke difficult; but does not
prevent the claim and possible establishment of the penalty.</p>

<p>78. A revoke cannot be claimed after the cards have been cut
for the following deal.</p>

<p>79. The revoking player and his partner may, under all circumstances,
require the hand in which the revoke has been detected
to be played out.</p>

<p>80. If a revoke occur, be claimed and proved, bets on the odd
trick or on amount of score, must be decided by the actual state of
the latter, after the penalty is paid.</p>

<p>81. Should the players on both sides subject themselves to the
penalty of one or more revokes, neither can win the game; each is
punished at the discretion of his adversary.</p>

<p>82. In whatever way the penalty be enforced, under no circumstances
can a player win the game by the result of the hand during
which he has revoked; he cannot score more than four. (<i>See</i> Law
61.)</p>

<h4>CALLING FOR NEW CARDS.</h4>

<p>83. Any player (on paying for them) before, but not after, the
pack be cut for the deal, may call for fresh cards. He must call
for two new packs, of which the dealer takes his choice.</p>

<h4>GENERAL RULES.</h4>

<p>84. Where a player and his partner have an option of exacting
from their adversaries one of two penalties, they should agree who
is to make the election, but must not consult with one another
which of the two penalties it is advisable to exact; if they do so
consult, they lose their right; and if either of them, with or without
consent of his partner, demand a penalty to which he is entitled,
such decision is final.</p>

<p>[This rule does not apply in exacting the penalties for a revoke;
partners have then a right to consult.]</p>

<p>85. Any one during the play of a trick, or after the four cards
are played, and before, but not after, they are touched for the purpose
of gathering them together, may demand that the cards be
placed before their respective players.</p>

<p>86. If any one, prior to his partner playing, should call attention
to the trick&mdash;either by saying that it is his, or by naming his
card, or, without being required so to do, by drawing it toward
him&mdash;the adversaries may require that opponent’s partner to play
the highest or lowest of the suit then led, or to win or lose the trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>87. In all cases where a penalty has been incurred, the offender
is bound to give reasonable time for the decision of his adversaries.</p>

<p>88. If a bystander make any remark which calls the attention
of a player or players to an oversight affecting the score, he is
liable to be called on, by the players only, to pay the stakes and all
bets on that game or rubber.</p>

<p>89. A bystander, by agreement among the players, may decide
any question.</p>

<p>90. A card or cards torn or marked must be either replaced by
agreement, or new cards called at the expense of the table.</p>

<p>91. Any player may demand to see the last trick turned, and
no more. Under no circumstances can more than eight cards be
seen during the play of the hand, <i>viz.</i>: the four cards on the table
which have not been turned and quitted, and the last trick turned.</p>

<h3>ETIQUETTE OF WHIST.</h3>

<p>The following rules belong to the established Etiquette of Whist.
They are not called laws, as it is difficult&mdash;in some cases impossible&mdash;to
apply any penalty to their infraction, and the only
remedy is to cease to play with players who habitually disregard
them:</p>

<p>Two packs of cards are invariably used at Clubs; if possible,
this should be adhered to.</p>

<p>Any one, having the lead and several winning cards to play,
should not draw a second card out of his hand until his partner
has played to the first trick, such act being a distinct intimation
that the former has played a winning card.</p>

<p>No intimation whatever, by word or gesture, should be given by
a player as to the state of his hand, or of the game.</p>

<p>A player who desires the cards to be placed, or who demands to
see the last trick, should do it for his own information only, and
not in order to invite the attention of his partner.</p>

<p>No player should object to refer to a bystander who professes
himself uninterested in the game, and able to decide any disputed
question of facts; as to who played any particular card&mdash;whether
honours were claimed though not scored, or <i>vice versa</i>&mdash;etc., etc.</p>

<p>It is unfair to revoke purposely; having made a revoke, a player
is not justified in making a second in order to conceal the first.</p>

<p>Until the players have made such bets as they wish, bets should
not be made with bystanders.</p>

<p>Bystanders should make no remark, neither should they by word
or gesture give any intimation of the state of the game until concluded
and scored, nor should they walk round the table to look
at the different hands.</p>

<p>No one should look over the hand of a player against whom he
is betting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<h3>DUMMY.</h3>

<p>Is played by three players.</p>

<p>One hand, called Dummy’s, lies exposed on the table.</p>

<p>The laws are the same as those of Whist, with the following
exceptions:</p>

<p>I. Dummy deals at the commencement of each rubber.</p>

<p>II. Dummy is not liable to the penalty for a revoke, as his adversaries
see his cards; should he revoke, and the error not be
discovered until the trick is turned and quitted, it stands good.</p>

<p>III. Dummy being blind and deaf, his partner is not liable to
any penalty for an error whence he can gain no advantage. Thus,
he may expose some or all of his cards&mdash;or may declare that he
has the game, or trick, etc., without incurring any penalty; if,
however, he lead from Dummy’s hand when he should lead from
his own, or <i>vice versa</i>, a suit may be called from the hand which
ought to have led.</p>

<h3>DOUBLE DUMMY.</h3>

<p>Is played by two players, each having a Dummy or exposed
hand for his partner. The laws of the game do not differ from
Dummy Whist, except in the following special Law: There is no
misdeal, as the deal is a disadvantage.</p>

<h2 id="THE_POKER_FAMILY">THE POKER FAMILY.</h2>

<p>Properly speaking, Poker is not the founder, but simply the most
famous representative of a very ancient and always very popular
family of games, all of which can be traced to one source, the old
French game of Gilet, which was undoubtedly of Italian origin,
perhaps a variety of Primero. Gilet we find changed to Brelan in
the time of Charles IX., and although Brelan is no longer played,
the word is still used in all French games to signify triplets, and
“brelan-carré” is the common French term for four of a kind in
<i>le poker Américain</i>. From Brelan we trace the French games
of Bouillotte, and Ambigu, and the English game of Brag; but the
game of poker, as first played in the United States, five cards to
each player from a twenty-card pack, is undoubtedly the Persian
game of <i>as nas</i>.</p>

<p>The peculiar and distinguishing characteristic of Poker we find
well described by Seymour, in his chapter on “Brag,” in the
“Court Gamester,” 1719: “The endeavour to impose on the
judgment of the rest who play, and particularly on the person who
chiefly offers to oppose you, by boasting or bragging of the cards
in your hand. Those who by fashioning their looks and gestures,
can give a proper air to their actions, as will so deceive an unskilful
antagonist, that sometimes a pair of fives, trays or deuces,
in such a hand, with the advantage of his composed countenance,
and subtle manner of over-awing the other, shall out-brag a much
greater hand, and win the stakes, with great applause and laughter
on his side from the whole company.”</p>

<p>Quite a number of card games retain the feature of pairs, triplets,
sequences, and flushes, but omit the element of brag or bluff, and
can therefore hardly be considered full-blooded members of the
poker family. Whiskey Poker, for instance, has really little or
nothing in common with the true spirit of poker, and is simply the
very ancient game of Commerce, played with five cards instead of
three. The descriptions of this game in the earliest Hoyles betray
its French origin; particularly in the use of the piquet pack; the
French custom of cutting to the left and dealing to the right; and
the use of the words “brelan,” and “tricon.” In later descriptions
of the “new form” of Commerce, about 1835, we find 52 cards
are used, and dealt from left to right, and the names of the combinations
are changed to “pairs-royal,” “sequences,” and
“flushes.”</p>

<p>There appears to be little or nothing modern in the game of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Poker but the increased number of cards dealt to each player,
which makes it possible for one to hold double combinations, such
as two pairs, triplets with a pair, etc. The old games were all
played with three cards only, and the “brelan-carré,” or four of a
kind, could be made only by combining the three cards held by the
player with the card which was sometimes turned up on the talon,
or remainder of the pack. The blind, the straddle, the raise, the
bluff, table stakes, and freeze-out, are all to be found in Bouillotte,
which flourished in the time of the French Revolution, and
the “draw” from the remainder of the pack existed in the old
French game of Ambigu.</p>

<p>The first mention we have of poker in print is in Green’s Reformed
Gambler, which contains a description of a game of poker
played on a river steamer in June, 1834. The author undertook
a series of investigations with a view to discovering the origin of
poker, the results of which were published in the N.Y. Sun, May
22, 1904. It would seem that poker came from Persia to this country
by way of New Orleans. The French settlers in Louisiana,
recognizing the similarity between the combinations held in the
newcomer from the East, <i>as nas</i>, and those with which they were
already familiar in their own game of poque, called the Persian
game poque, instead of <i>as nas</i>, and our present word, “poker,”
seems to be nothing but a mispronunciation of the French term,
dividing it into two syllables, as if it were “po-que.”</p>

<p>There is no authoritative code of laws for the game of Poker,
simply because the best clubs do not admit the game to their
card rooms, and consequently decry the necessity for adopting any
laws for its government. In the absence of any official code, the
daily press is called upon for hundreds of decisions every week.
The author has gathered and compared a great number of these
newspaper rulings, and has drawn from them and other sources to
form a brief code of poker laws, which will be found amply sufficient
to cover all irregularities for which any penalty can be enforced,
or which interfere with the rights of any individual player.</p>

<h3>DRAW POKER.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Poker is played with a full pack of fifty-two cards,
ranking: A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2; the ace being the highest or
lowest in play, according to the wish of the
holder, but ranking below the deuce in cutting.
In some localities a special pack of sixty cards
is used, the eight extra cards being elevens and
twelves in each suit, which rank above the ten,
and below the Jack. It is very unusual to play
Poker with two packs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 130px;">
<img src="images/p208.jpg" width="130" height="75" alt="11♣ 12♣" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>COUNTERS, or CHIPS.</b></i> Although not absolutely necessary,
counters are much more convenient than money. The most
common are red, white, and blue circular chips, which should
“stack up” accurately, so that equal numbers may be measured
without counting them. The red are usually worth five whites,
and the blue worth five reds, or twenty-five whites. At the beginning
of the game one player should act as banker, and be responsible
for all counters at the table. It is usual for each player to
purchase, at the beginning of the game, the equivalent of 100
white counters in white, red, and blue.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Poker may be played by any number of persons
from two to seven. When there are more than seven candidates
for play, two tables should be formed, unless the majority vote
against it. In some localities it is the custom for the dealer to take
no cards when there are eight players, which is thought to make a
better game than two tables of only four players each. When the
sixty-card pack is used, eight players may take cards.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> The players who shall form the table, and their
positions at the beginning of the game, must be decided by throwing
round a card to each candidate, face up, or by drawing cards
from an outspread pack. If there are more than eight candidates,
the four cutting the highest cards should play together at one table,
and the others at another table. If there are an even number of
candidates, the tables divide evenly, but if the number is odd, the
smaller table is formed by those cutting the highest cards.</p>

<p>The table formed, the pack must be shuffled and spread, and
positions drawn for. The player cutting the lowest card has the
choice of seats, and must deal the first hand. The player cutting
the next lowest has the next choice, and so on, until all are seated.</p>

<p><i><b>TIES.</b></i> If the first cut does not decide, those tying must cut
again. Should two or more players cut cards of equal value, the
new cut will decide nothing but the tie; for even should one of
those cutting to decide a tie draw a card lower than one previously
cut by another player, the original low cannot be deprived of his
right. For instance: there are six players.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p209.jpg" width="500" height="150" alt="First cut is 🂥 🃘 🃋 🂷 🃞 🃈 Second cut is (none) 🂴 (none) (none) (none) 🃒" />
</div>

<p>The 5 and 7 have the first and second choice of seats; the 2
and 4 the third and fourth choice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS’ POSITIONS.</b></i> There are only three distinctive
positions at the poker table: the <i><b>dealer</b></i>; the <i><b>pone</b></i>; and the
<i><b>age</b></i>. The pone is the player on the dealer’s right, and the age is
the one on his left.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> Before play begins, or a card is dealt, the value of
the counters must be decided, and a <i><b>limit</b></i> must be agreed upon.
There are four limitations in Draw Poker, and they govern or fix
the maximum of the four principal stakes: the blind; the straddle;
the ante; and the bet or raise.</p>

<p>The <i><b>blind</b></i> is the amount put up by the age before he sees
anything, and should be limited to one white counter, as the blind
is the smallest stake in the game. In some places it is permissible
for the age to make the blind any amount he pleases within
half the betting limit; but such a practice is a direct violation of
the principles of the game, which require that the amount of the
blind shall bear a fixed proportion to the limit of the betting.</p>

<p>The <i><b>straddle</b></i> is a double blind, sometimes put up by the player
to the left of the age, and like the blind, without seeing anything.
This allows the player on the left of the straddler to double again,
or put up four times the amount of the original blind. This straddling
process is usually limited to one-fourth of the betting limit;
that is, if the betting limit is fifty counters, the doubling of the
blind must cease when a player puts up sixteen, for another double
would carry it to thirty-two, which would be more than half the
limit for a bet or raise.</p>

<p>The <i><b>ante</b></i> is the amount put up by each player after he has
seen his cards, but before he draws to improve his hand. The
terms “ante” and “blind” are often confused. The blind is a compulsory
stake, and must be put up before the player has seen anything.
He does not even know whether or not he will be dealt a
foul hand, or whether it will be a misdeal. He has not even seen the
cards cut. The ante, on the other hand, is a voluntary bet, and is
a sort of entrance fee, which is paid before the hand is complete,
but after the first part of it has been seen. The ante is always
twice the amount of the blind, whatever that may be. If the blind
has been increased by the process of straddling, the ante must be
twice the amount of the last straddle, but must not exceed the
betting limit. This is why the straddles are limited.</p>

<p>The largest <i><b>bet</b></i>, or <i><b>raise</b></i>, which a player is allowed to make is
generally known as <i><b>the limit</b></i>. This limit is not the greatest
amount that may be bet on one hand, but is the maximum amount
by which one player may increase his bet over that of another
player. For instance: If no one has bet, A may bet the limit on
his hand; B may then put up a similar amount, which is called
<i><b>seeing</b></i> him, and may then <i><b>raise</b></i> him any further sum within the
limit fixed for betting. If B raises the limit, it is obvious that he
has placed in the pool twice the amount of the betting limit; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
his <i><b>raise</b></i> over A’s bet is within the betting limit. If another player
should raise B again, he would be putting up three times the limit;
A’s bet, B’s raise, and his own raise.</p>

<p>In the absence of any definite arrangement, it is usual to make
the betting limit fifty times the amount of the blind. That is, if
the value of the blind, or one white counter, is five cents, the limit
of a bet or raise will be two dollars and a half, or two blue counters.
This fixes the ante at two white counters, or ten cents, in the
absence of straddles, and limits the straddling to the fourth player
from the age, or sixteen white counters. This proportion makes a
very fair game, and gives a player some opportunity to vary his
betting according to his estimate of the value of his hand.
Where the blind is five cents, the ante ten, and the limit twenty-five,
the game ceases to be Poker, and becomes a species of <i><b>show-down</b></i>.
It is universally admitted by good judges that a player
can lose more money at twenty-five cent show-down than he will
at two-and-a-half Poker.</p>

<p>There are several other variations in the manner of arranging
the stakes and the betting limits, but they will be better understood
after the game itself has been described.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> The age having put up the amount of the blind,
and the cards having been shuffled by any player who chooses to
avail himself of the privilege, the dealer last, they are presented to
the pone to be cut. The pone may either cut them, or signify
that he does not wish to do so by tapping the pack with his
knuckles. Should the pone decline to cut, no other player can
insist on his so doing, nor do it for him. Beginning on his left,
the dealer distributes the cards face down one at a time in rotation
until each player has received five cards. The deal passes to the
left, and each player deals in turn.</p>

<p><i><b>IRREGULARITIES IN THE DEAL.</b></i> The following
rules regarding the deal should be strictly observed:&mdash;</p>

<p>If any card is found faced in the pack the dealer must deal
again. Should the dealer, or the wind, turn over any card, the
player to whom it is dealt must take it; but the same player cannot
be compelled to take two exposed cards. Should such a combination
occur, there must be a fresh deal by the same dealer. If
the player exposes his cards himself, he has no remedy.</p>

<p>Should any player receive more or less than his correct number
of cards, and discover the error before he looks at any card in his
hand, or lifts it from the table, he may demand a fresh deal if no
bet has been made; or he may ask the dealer to give him another
from the pack if he has too few; or to draw a card if he has too
many. Cards so drawn must not be exposed, but should be
placed on the bottom of the pack.</p>

<p>If the number of the hands dealt does not agree with the number
of players, there must be a new deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>If two or more cards are dealt at a time, the dealer may take
back the card or cards improperly dealt if he discovers the error
before dealing to the next player; otherwise there must be a new
deal.</p>

<p>A misdeal does not lose the deal. The misdealer must deal
again.</p>

<p>Should a player take up his hand, or look at any card in it, he is
not entitled to any remedy. If he has more or less than the proper
number of cards, his hand is foul, and must be abandoned, the
player forfeiting any interest he may have in that deal, and any
stake he may have put up on that hand. In all gambling houses,
the invariable rule is to call a short hand foul; although there
should be no objection to playing against a man with only four
cards, which cannot be increased to five, even by the draw.</p>

<p><i><b>STRADDLING.</b></i> During the deal, or at any time before he
looks at any card in his hand, the player to the left of the age may
<i><b>straddle the blind</b></i> by putting up double the amount put up by
the age. The only privilege this secures to the straddler is that
of having the last <i><b>say</b></i> as to whether or nor he will make good his
ante and draw cards. Should he refuse to straddle, no other
player can do so; but if he straddles, the player on his left
can straddle him again by doubling the amount he puts up, which
will be four times the amount of the blind. This will open
the privilege to the next player on the left again, and so on until
the limit of straddling is reached; but if one player refuses to
straddle, no other following him can do so. Good players seldom
or never straddle, as the only effect of it is to increase the amount
of the ante.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The cards dealt, the players
take up and examine their hands. The careful poker player
always “spreads” his cards before taking them up, to be sure
that he has neither more nor less than five, and he lifts them in
such a way that the palm and fingers of his right hand conceal the
face of the first card, while the thumb of the left hand separates
the others just sufficiently to allow him to read the index or
“squeezer” marks on the edges.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The object of this examination is to ascertain the value of the
hand dealt to him, and to see whether or not it is worth while trying
to improve it by discarding certain cards and drawing others
in their place. The player should not only be thoroughly familiar
with the relative value of the various combinations which may be
held at Poker, but should have some idea of the chances for and
against better combinations being held by other players, and should
also know the odds against improving any given combination by
drawing to it.</p>

<p>The value of this technical knowledge will be obvious when it is
remembered that a player may have a hand dealt to him which he
knows is comparatively worthless as it is, and the chances for
improving which are only one in twelve, but which he must bet on
at odds of one in three, or abandon it. Such a proceeding would
evidently be a losing game, for if the experiment were tried
twelve times the player would win once only, and would lose
eleven times. This would be paying eleven dollars to win three;
yet poker players are continually doing this.</p>

<p><i><b>RANK OF THE HANDS.</b></i> The various combinations at
Poker outrank one another in the following order, beginning with
the lowest. Cards with a star over them add nothing to the
value of the hand, and may be discarded. The figures on the
right are the odds against such a hand being dealt to any individual
player.</p>

<p>When hands are of the same rank, their relative value is determined
by the denomination of the cards they contain. For
instance: A hand without a pair, sequence, or flush is called by
its highest card; “ace high,” or “Jack high,” as the case may
be. As between two such hands, the one containing the highest
card would be the better, but either would be outclassed by
a hand with a pair in it, however small. A hand with a pair
of nines in it would outrank one with a pair of sevens, even
though the cards accompanying the nines were only a deuce,
three and four, while those with the sevens were an ace, King and
Queen. But should the pairs be alike in both hands; such as
tens, the highest card outside the pair would decide the rank of
the hands, and if those were also alike, the next card, or perhaps
the fifth would have to be considered. Should the three odd cards
in each hand be identical, the hands would be a tie, and would
divide any pool to which each had a claim. Two flushes would
decide their rank in the same manner. If both were ace and Jack
high, the third card in one being a nine, and in the other an eight,
the nine would win. In full hands the rank of the triplets decides
the value of the hand. Three Queens and a pair of deuces will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
beat three Jacks and a pair of aces. In straights, the highest card
of the sequence wins; not necessarily the highest card in the
hand, for a player may have a sequence of A 2 3 4 5, which is
only five high, and would be beaten by a sequence of 2 3 4 5 6.
The ace must either begin or end a sequence, for a player is not
allowed to call such a combination as Q K A 2 3 a straight.</p>

<p>It was evidently the intention of those who invented Poker that
the hands most difficult to obtain should be the best, and should
outrank hands that occurred more frequently. A glance at the
table of odds will show that this principle has been carried out as
far as the various denominations of hands go; but when we come
to the members of the groups the principle is violated. In hands
not containing a pair, for instance, ace high will beat Jack high,
but it is much more common to hold ace high than Jack high.
The exact proportion is 503 to 127. A hand of five cards only
seven high but not containing a pair, is rarer than a flush; the
proportion being 408 to 510. When we come to two pairs, we
find the same inversion of probability and value. A player will
hold “aces up,” that is, a pair of aces and another pair inferior to
aces, twelve times as often as he will hold “threes up.” In the
opinion of the author, in all hands that do not contain a pair,
“seven high” should be the best instead of the lowest, and ace
high should be the lowest. In hands containing two pairs,
“threes up” should be the highest, and “aces up” the lowest.</p>

<p><i><b>ECCENTRIC HANDS.</b></i> In addition to the regular poker
hands, which are those already given, there are a few combinations
which are played in some parts of the country, especially in the
South, either as matter of local custom or by agreement. When
any of these are played, it would be well for the person who is not
accustomed to them to have a distinct understanding in advance,
just what combinations shall be allowed and what hands they will
beat. There are four of these eccentric hands, and the figures on
the right are the odds against their being dealt to any individual
player:</p>

<p>The rank of these extra hands has evidently been assigned by
guess-work. The absurdity of their appraised value will be evident
if we look at the first of them, the blaze, which is usually played
to beat two pairs. As it is impossible to have a blaze which does
not contain two pairs of court cards, all that they beat is aces up
or kings up. If it were ranked, like other poker hands, by the
difficulty of getting it, a blaze should beat a full hand.</p>

<p>All these hands are improperly placed in the scale of poker
values, as will be seen by comparing the odds against them. In
any games to which these eccentric hands are admitted, the rank
of all the combinations would be as follows, if poker principles
were followed throughout:&mdash;</p>

<p>When the true rank of these eccentric hands is not allowed, local
custom must decide what they will beat.</p>

<p><i><b>JOKER POKER</b></i>, or <i><b>MISTIGRIS</b></i>. It is not uncommon
to leave the joker, or blank card, in the pack. The player to whom
this card is dealt may call it anything he pleases. If he has a pair
of aces, and the joker, he may call them three aces. If he has
four clubs, and the joker, he may call it a flush; or he may make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the joker fill out a straight. If he has four of a kind, and the joker,
he can beat a royal flush by calling his hand five of a kind. In
case of ties, the hand with the mistigris wins; that is to say, an
ace and the joker will beat two aces.</p>

<p>A player holding the joker may even call it a duplicate of a card
already in his hand. For instance; he might hold the A J 8 5 of
hearts and the joker against the A K Q 7 3 of clubs. If he calls
the joker the king of hearts, the club flush still beats him as it is
queen next. He must call it the ace, which makes his flush ace-ace
high.</p>

<p><i><b>PROBABILITIES.</b></i> In estimating the value of his hand
as compared to that of any other player, before the draw, the
theory of probabilities is of little or no use, and the calculations
will vary with the number of players engaged. For instance: If
five are playing, some one should have two pairs every fourth
deal, because in four deals twenty hands will be given out. If
seven are playing, it is probable that five of them will hold a pair
of some kind before the draw. Unfortunately, these calculations
are not of the slightest practical use to a poker player, because
although three of a kind may not be dealt to a player more than
once in forty-five times on the average, it is quite a common occurrence
for two players to have threes dealt to each of them at the
same time. The considerations which must guide the player in
judging the comparative value of his hand, both before and after
the draw, must be left until we come to the suggestions for good
play.</p>

<p><i><b>THE ANTE.</b></i> The player to the left of the age is the one
who must make the first announcement of his opinion of his hand,
unless he has straddled, in which case the player on the left of the
last straddler has the first “<i><b>say</b></i>.” If he considers his hand good
enough to draw to, let us say a pair of Kings, he must place in
the pool, or toward the centre of the table, double the amount of
the blind, or of the last straddle, if any. This is called the ante,
because it is made before playing the hand, whereas the blind is
made before seeing it. The player is not restricted to double the
amount of the blind or straddle; he may bet as much more as he
pleases within the limit fixed at the beginning of the game. For
instance: If there has been only one straddle he must put up
four white counters or pass out of the game for that deal. But if
he puts up the four, he may put up as many more as he pleases
within the limit, which is two blues, or fifty whites. This is called
<i><b>raising the ante</b></i>. If he does not care to pay twice the amount
of the blind or straddle for the privilege of drawing cards to improve
his hand, he must throw his cards face downward on the
table in front of the player whose turn it will be to deal next.
Reasonable time must be allowed for a player to make his decision;
but having made it, he must abide by it; a hand once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
thrown down cannot be taken up again, and counters once placed
in the pool, and the hand removed from them, cannot be taken
out again, even though placed in the pool by mistake.</p>

<p>The player who has the first say having made his decision, the
player next him on the left must then decide. He must put into
the pool an amount equal to that deposited by the first player, or
abandon his hand. Suppose there has been no straddle, and that
all conclude to <i><b>stay</b></i>, as it is called. They each in turn put up two
white counters until it comes to the age. The one white counter
he has already put up as a blind belongs to the pool, but by adding
one to it he can make his ante good, and draw cards, always
provided no player has raised the ante. If any player has put
more counters into the pool than the amount of the ante, all the
other players must put up a like amount, or throw down their
hands. Suppose five play, and A has the age. B antes two
counters, and C puts up seven, the ante and a raise of five. If D
and E come in, they must put up seven counters also; and the age,
A, must put up six to make his ante good. It now comes to B, who
must either lose the two he has already put up, or add five more
to them. Let us suppose that D puts up the seven, and that E,
the dealer, puts up twelve. This will force the age to put up
eleven; B to put up ten; and C to put up five more. This will
make each player’s ante an equal amount, twelve counters, and
they will then be ready to draw cards. No one can now raise the
ante any further, because it is no one’s turn to “say.”</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that every player in his turn can do one of
three things, which are sometimes called the <i><b>a b c</b></i> of Poker: He
can <i><b>Abdicate</b></i>; by throwing down his hand, and abandoning
whatever money he has already placed in the pool. He can <i><b>Better</b></i>;
by putting up more money than any player before him, which
is sometimes called “going better.” Or, he can <i><b>Call</b></i>, by making
his amount in the pool equal to the highest bet already made.</p>

<p>Should any player increase the ante to such an extent that none
of the others care to call him, they must of course throw down
their hands, and as there is no one to play against him, the one
who made the last increase in the ante takes down all the counters
in the pool. This is called <i><b>taking the pot</b></i>, and the cards are
gathered, shuffled, and dealt again, the deal passing to the player
who was the age.</p>

<p><i><b>DRAWING CARDS.</b></i> All those who have made the ante
good have the privilege of discarding, face downward, as many
cards as they please, in the place of which they may draw others.
The age has the first draw, and can take any number of cards
from one to five, or he may <i><b>stand pat</b></i>, refusing to draw any.
A player cannot receive from the dealer more or less cards than
he discards; so that if a person is allowed to play with a short
hand, of four cards only, he will still have only four cards after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the draw. If his hand was foul, it will remain so after the draw.
In drawing, a player may keep or discard what cards he pleases.
There is no rule to prevent his throwing away a pair of aces and
keeping three clubs if he is so inclined; but the general practice is
for the player to retain whatever pairs or triplets he may have,
and to draw to them. Four cards of a straight or a flush may be
drawn to in the same way, and some make a practice of drawing
to one or two high cards, such as an ace and a king, when they
have no other chance. Some hands offer opportunities to vary
the draw. For instance: A player has dealt to him a small pair;
but finds he has also four
cards of a straight. He
can discard three cards and
draw to the pair; or one
card, and draw to the
straight; or two cards, keeping his ace in the hope of making two
good pairs, aces up. The details of the best methods of drawing
to various combinations will be discussed when we come to suggestions
for good play.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/p219.jpg" width="280" height="75" alt="🂱 🂴 🃒 🂣 🃄" />
</div>

<p>In drawing cards, each player in turn who has made good his
ante, beginning with the age, must ask the dealer for the number
of cards he wants. The demand must be made so that every
player can hear, because after the cards have been delivered by
the dealer no one has the right to be informed how many cards
any player drew. When the dealer comes to his own hand, he
must distinctly announce the number of cards he takes. He must
also inform any player asking him how many cards he took, provided
the question is put before the player asking it has made a
bet, and it is put by a player who has made good his ante to draw
cards.</p>

<p>In dealing the cards for the draw, the pack is not cut again, the
cards being dealt from the top, beginning where the deal before
the draw left off. As each player asks for his cards he must discard
those he wants replaced, and he must receive the entire number
he asks for before the next player is helped. In some places it
is the custom for all those who have made good the ante to discard
before any cards are given out. This is not good poker, as it prevents
the dealer from seeing that the number discarded is equal to
the number asked for. Should any card be found faced in the
pack, it must be placed on the table among the discards. Should
any card be exposed by the dealer in giving out the cards, or be
blown over by the wind before the player has touched it, such
card must not be taken by the player under any circumstances,
but must be placed with the discards on the table. A player whose
card is exposed in this manner does not receive a card to take its
place until all the other players have been helped. [The object of
this rule is to prevent a dealer from altering the run of the cards
in the draw.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Should a player ask for an incorrect number of cards and they
be given him, he must take them if the next player has been
helped. If too many, he must discard before seeing them. If too
few, he must play them. If he has taken them up and has too
many, his hand is foul, and shuts him out of that pool. If the
dealer gives himself more cards than he needs he is compelled to
take them. For instance: He draws three cards to a pair; but on
taking up his hand he finds he had triplets, and really wanted only
two cards. He cannot change his draw, and must take the three
cards he has dealt off. There is a penalty for not following the
strict rule of the game, which is for each player, including the
dealer, to discard before he draws.</p>

<p>Should the dealer give any player more cards than he asked for,
and the player discover the error before taking them up or looking
at any of them, the dealer must withdraw the surplus card,
and place it on the top of the pack. Should the dealer give a
player fewer cards than he asks for, he must supply the deficiency
when his attention is called to it, without waiting to supply the
other players. If a player has more or less than five cards after
the draw, his hand is foul, and he must abandon it, together with
all he may have already staked in the pool.</p>

<p>The dealer may be asked how many cards he drew; but he is
not allowed to say how many cards he gave to any other player.
Each player must watch the draw for himself.</p>

<p>The last card of the pack must not be dealt. When only two
cards remain, the discards and abandoned hands must be gathered,
shuffled, and presented to the pone to be cut, and the deal then
completed.</p>

<p><i><b>BETTING UP THE HANDS.</b></i> All those who made
good the ante having been supplied with cards, the next player
who holds cards on the left of the age must make the first bet.
Should the age have declined to make good his ante, or have
passed out before the draw, that does not transfer the privilege of
having the last say to any other player; because the peculiar privilege
of the age,&mdash;having the last say,&mdash;is given in consideration of
the blind, which he is <i>compelled</i> to pay, and no other player can
have that privilege, because no other player is obliged to play.
Even if a player has straddled the blind, he must still make the
first bet after the draw, because he straddled of his own free will,
and knew at the time that the only advantage the straddle would
give him was the last say as to whether or not he would make
good his ante and draw cards.</p>

<p>If the player next to the age has passed out before the draw,
the next player to the left who still holds cards must make the
first bet. The player whose turn it is to bet must either do so, or
throw his hand face downward in front of the player whose turn
it will be to deal next. If he bets, he can put up any amount from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
one white counter to the limit, two blues. It then becomes the turn
of the player next on his left who still holds cards to abdicate,
better, or call. If he calls, he does so by placing in the pool an
amount equal to that staked by the last player, and it then becomes
the turn of the next player on the left to say what he will do. But
if he goes better, he adds to the amount staked by the player on
his right any further sum he sees fit, within the limit of two blues.
Each player in turn has the same privilege, the age having the last
say.</p>

<p>Suppose five play, and that A has the age. B has straddled,
and all but the dealer have made good the ante and drawn cards.
There are sixteen white counters in the pool, B’s straddle having
made the ante four instead of two. Suppose B bets a red counter,
and C then throws down his hand. D <i><b>sees</b></i> B, by putting up a
red counter; and he then <i><b>raises</b></i> him, by putting up two blues,
increasing his bet as much as the limit will allow him. The age
must now abandon his hand or put up one red and two blues to
call D, without knowing what B proposes to do. Let us suppose
he sees D, and raises another two blues. B must now retire, or
put up four blues to call A, without knowing what D will do. He
can raise the bet another two blues, or one blue, or a red, or a
white even, if he is so minded. If he declines to raise, he cannot
prevent D from so doing, because D still has the privilege of replying
to A’s raise, and as long as a player has any <i><b>say</b></i> about
anything, whether it is to abdicate, better, or call, he can do any
one of the three. It is only when there is no bet made, or when
his own bet is either not called or not raised, that a player has
nothing to say. Let us suppose B puts up the four blues to call A.
It is now D’s turn. If he puts up two blues, each will have an
equal amount in the pool, and as no one will have anything more
to say, the betting must stop, and the hands must be shown. But
if D raises A again, by putting up four blues instead of two, he
gives A another say, and perhaps A will raise D in turn. Although
B may have had quite enough of this, he must either put up four
more blues, the two raised by D and the further raise by A, or he
must abandon his hand. If B throws down his cards he loses all
claim to what he has already staked in the pool, four blues and a
red, besides his straddle and ante. Let us suppose he drops out,
and that D just calls A, by putting up two blues only, making the
amount he has in the pool exactly equal to A’s, eight blues and a
red, besides the antes. This prevents A from going any further,
because it is not his turn to say anything. He is not asked to
meet any one’s raise, nor to make any bet himself, but simply to
show his hand, in order to see whether or not it is better than D’s.</p>

<p><i><b>SHOWING HANDS.</b></i> It is the general usage that the
hand <i><b>called</b></i> must be shown first. In this case A’s hand is called,
for D was the one who called a halt on A in the betting, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
stopped him from going any further. The strict laws of the game
require that both hands must be shown, and if there are more than
two in the final call, all must be shown to the table. The excuse
generally made for not showing the losing hand is that the man
with the worse hand paid to see the better hand; but it must
not be forgotten that the man with the better hand has paid exactly
the same amount, and is equally entitled to see the worse
hand. There is an excellent rule in some clubs that a player refusing
to show his hand in a call shall refund the amount of the
antes to all the other players, or pay all the antes in the next jack
pot. The rule of showing both hands is a safeguard against collusion
between two players, one of whom might have a fairly good
hand, and the other nothing; but by mutually raising each other
back and forth they could force any other player out of the pool.
The good hand could then be called and shown, the confederate
simply saying, “That is good,” and throwing down his hand. Professionals
call this system of cheating, “raising out.”</p>

<p>When the hands are called and shown, the best poker hand
wins, their rank being determined by the table of values already
given. In the example just given suppose that A, on being called
by D, had shown three fours, and that D had three deuces. A
would take the entire pool, including all the antes, and the four
blues and one red staked by B after the draw. It might be that B
would now discover that he had <i><b>laid down</b></i> the best hand, having
held three sixes. This discovery would be of no benefit to him,
for he abandoned his hand when he declined to meet the raises of
A and D.</p>

<p>If the hands are exactly a tie, the pool must be divided among
those who are in at the call. For instance: Two players show
aces up, and each finds his opponent’s second pair to be eights.
The odd card must decide the pool; and if that card is also a tie
the pool must be divided.</p>

<p>If no bet is made after the draw, each player in turn throwing
down his cards, the antes are won by the last player who holds his
hand. This is usually the age, because he has the last say. If
the age has not made good his ante, it will be the dealer, and so
on to the right. There is no necessity for the fortunate player to
show his hand; the mere fact that he is the only one holding any
cards is prima facie evidence that his hand is the best. On the same
principle, the player who has made a bet or raise which no other
player will see, wins the pool without showing his hand, as he must
be the only one with cards in his hand; for when a player refuses to
see a bet he must abandon his hand, and with it all pretensions to
the pool. If he wishes to call, but has not money enough, he
must borrow it. He cannot demand a show of hands for what
counters he has, except in table stakes.</p>

<p>During the betting, players are at liberty to make any remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
they see fit, and to tell as many cheerful lies about their hands as
they please. A player may even miscall his hand when he shows
it; the cards speak for themselves, just as the counters do, and
what a player says does not affect either in the slightest. If a
player says: “I raise you two blues,” the statement amounts to
nothing until the blues have been placed in the pool, and the
owner’s hand removed from them. There is no penalty if a player,
during the betting, tells his adversaries exactly what he holds; nor
is he likely to lose anything by it, for no one will believe him.</p>

<p><i><b>JACK POTS.</b></i> The addition of jack pots has probably done
more to injure Poker than the trump signal has injured Whist. In
the early days, when poker parties were small, four players being a
common number, it was frequently the case that no one had a pair
strong enough to draw to, and such a deal was regarded as simply
a waste of time. To remedy this, it was proposed that whenever
no player came in, each should be obliged to ante an equal amount
for the next deal, and just to demonstrate that there were some
good hands left in the pack no one was allowed to draw cards until
some one had <i><b>Jacks or better</b></i> to draw to.</p>

<p>The result of this practice was to make jack pots larger than the
other pools, because every one was compelled to ante, and this
seems to have prompted those who were always wanting to increase
the stakes to devise excuses for increasing the number of
jack pots. This has been carried so far that the whole system has
become a nuisance, and has destroyed one of the finest points in
the game of Poker,&mdash;the liberty of personal judgment as to every
counter put into the pool, except the blind. The following excuses
for making jack pots are now in common use:</p>

<p><i><b>After a Misdeal</b></i> some parties make it a jack; but the practice
should be condemned, because it puts it in the power of any
individual player to make it a jack when he deals.</p>

<p><i><b>The Buck</b></i> is some article, such as a penknife, which is placed
in the pool at the beginning of the game, and is taken down with
the rest of the pool by whichever player wins it. When it comes
to his deal, it is a jack pot, and the buck is placed in the pool with
the dealer’s ante, to be won, taken down, and make another jack
in the same way.</p>

<p>The usual custom is to fix the amount of the ante in jack pots,
a red, or five whites, being the common stake. In some places it
is at the option of the holder of the buck to make the ante any
amount he pleases within the betting limit. Whichever system is
adopted, every player at the table must deposit a like amount in
the pool. Players are sometimes permitted to <i><b>pass a jack</b></i>;
that is, not to ante nor to take any part in the game until the jack
is decided. If this is to be allowed, it should be so understood at
the beginning of the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>The High Hand</b></i> jack pot is played whenever a hand of an
agreed value, such as a flush or a full, is shown to the board; that
is, called. In some places four of a kind calls for <i><b>a round of
jacks</b></i>, every player in turn making it a jack on his deal.</p>

<p><i><b>Only Two In.</b></i> It is a common custom in large parties, say six
or seven players, to make it a jack when no one but the dealer
will ante. Instead of allowing the blind to make his ante good,
and draw cards against the dealer, each player contributes two
white counters, the age adding one to his blind, and the cards are
redealt for a jack pot. Another variety of this custom is when
the blind is opposed by only one ante, to allow the age to make
this player take down his two counters, and to pay two counters
for him, to make it a jack. For instance: Five play, and A has
the age. B and C pass, and D antes two counters. The dealer,
E, says: “I pass for a jack.” A then puts up three counters, one
of which is added to his blind, the other two paying D’s ante in
the ensuing jack. D takes down his two counters, and the cards
are redealt. This cannot be done if more than one player has
anted, nor if the ante has been raised or the blind straddled. In
the example just given, had D raised the ante to five counters
and E passed, the age would have had to put up four more white
counters and draw cards, or allow D to win his blind.</p>

<p><i><b>Progressive Jacks.</b></i> In some localities it is the custom to
make the pair necessary to open a jack pot progress in value;
Jacks or better to open the first round; Queens the next; then
Kings; then Aces; and then back to Kings, Queens, and Jacks
again. This is very confusing, and is not popular.</p>

<p><i><b>Fattening Jacks.</b></i> When the original ante is two counters
only, and no one holds Jacks or better on the first deal, each
player must contribute another white counter to “fatten,” and the
cards are dealt again. This continues until the pot is opened;
that is, until some player holds a hand as good or better than a
pair of Jacks. The fattening process is followed when the dealer
can make the original ante what he pleases; but if the ante for
jacks is a fixed sum, such as a red counter, it is not usual to fatten
the pot at all. This saves all disputes as to <i><b>who is shy</b></i>,
one of the greatest nuisances in Poker.</p>

<p><i><b>Opening Jacks.</b></i> As there is no age or straddle in any form
of jack pot, the player to the left of the dealer has the first say,
and must examine his hand to see if he has Jacks or better; that
is to say, either an actual pair of Jacks, or some hand that would
beat a pair of Jacks if called upon to do so, such as two pairs, a
straight, or triplets. In some localities it is allowed to open jacks
with a <i><b>bobtail</b></i>; that is, four cards of a flush or straight. If the
player on the dealer’s left has not openers, or does not care to
open the pot if he has, he says: “I pass;” but he does not abandon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
his hand. The next player on his left must then declare. In
some places players are allowed to throw down their cards when
they pass; but in first-class games a penalty of five white counters
must be paid into the pool by any player abandoning his hand
before the second round of declarations, as it gives an undue
advantage to players with medium hands to know that they have
only a limited number of possible opponents. For instance: If
six play, and the first three not only pass, but throw down and
abandon their cards, a player with a pair of Jacks will know that
he has only two possible adversaries to draw against him, which
will so increase his chances that it may materially alter his betting.</p>

<p>If no one acknowledges to holding Jacks or better, the pot is
fattened, and the cards are reshuffled and dealt. The best practice
is for the same dealer to deal again until some one gets Jacks
or better. This is called <i><b>dealing off the jack</b></i>. If any player
has forfeited his right in one deal, such as by having a foul hand,
that does not prevent him coming into the pot again on the next
deal with rights equal to the other players.</p>

<p>If any player holds Jacks or better, he can open the pot, or
“the jack,” for any amount he pleases within the betting limit.
The expression “open” is used because after one player has
declared that he holds Jacks or better, all restrictions are removed,
and the pool is then open to any player to come in and play for it,
regardless of what he may hold. Each player in turn, beginning
on the left of the opener, must declare whether or not he will
<i><b>stay</b></i>. If he stays, he must put up an amount equal to that bet
by the opener, and has the privilege of raising him if he sees fit.
If he passes, he throws his cards face downward on the table in
front of the player whose turn it will be to deal next. Should the
opener be raised, and not care to see that raise, he must show his
hand to the table before abandoning it, in order to demonstrate
that he had openers. Some players show only the cards necessary
to open, but the strict rules require the whole hand to be
shown before the draw. When once the jack is opened, the betting
before the draw proceeds exactly as in the ordinary pool.
Any player on the right of the opener, who passed on the first
round, may come in after the pot is opened. For instance: E
deals. A and B pass, but hold their hands. C opens, and D
throws down his hand. E sees the opener’s bet, and it then becomes
the turn of A and B, who have passed once, to say whether
or not they will play, now that the pot is opened.</p>

<p>When all those who have declared to stay have deposited an
equal amount in the pool, they draw cards to improve their hands,
just as in the ordinary pool, the player on the dealer’s left being
helped first. All those who draw cards, except the opener, throw
their discards into the centre of the table as usual; but the opener
is obliged always to place his discard under the chips in the pool.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
This is in order that he may be able to show what he held originally,
in case he should conclude to <i><b>split his openers</b></i> in order
to try for a better hand. For instance: He has opened with a
pair of Jacks, but has four of one suit in his hand. Four other
players have stayed, perhaps the bet has been raised, and he knows
that his Jacks will probably be worthless, even if he gets a third.
So he breaks the pair, and draws for a flush. As the opener always
places his discard under the chips in the pool, it is not necessary
for him to betray his game by telling the whole table that he is
drawing to a bobtail.</p>

<p><i><b>False Openers.</b></i> Should a player open a jack without the
hand to justify it, and discover his error before he draws, the best
usage demands that his hand is foul, and that he forfeits to the
pool whatever amount he may have opened for, and any raises
that he may have stood. There are then three ways to play:
<i><b>First.</b></i> Those who have come in under the impression that the
pot had been legitimately opened but who have not openers themselves,
can withdraw their money, and allow any one to open it
who has openers. This is very unfair to those on the left of the
false opener who have abandoned their hands. <i><b>Second.</b></i> Those
who have come into the pot after the false opening are allowed to
stay in, and play for it, no matter what their hands are. <i><b>Third.</b></i>
On discovery of the false opening, each player is allowed to take
down whatever amount he may have paid into the pool, including
his original ante and all fatteners, and the false opener must then
make the entire amount good. The cards are then dealt afresh.
This is a very harsh punishment for a very trifling and common
error.</p>

<p>The second method is the most popular, and probably the fairest,
and is now the universal rule.</p>

<p>If the false opener does not discover his mistake until he has
drawn cards, his action is at least suspicious, and he should be
compelled to put up the total amount in the pool, as in case three.
In some localities such a player is barred from playing the next
two jacks, but compelled to ante his share in each.</p>

<p><i><b>Betting Jacks.</b></i> When a jack pot has been properly opened,
and all have declared whether or not they will stay, and have
drawn cards, the players proceed to bet on their hands. As there
is no age in jack pots, the rule is for the opener to make the first
bet; or, if he has been raised out before the draw, the player next
on his left who still holds cards. The opener may decline to bet
if he pleases; but if he does so, he must show his openers, and
then abandon his hand. If no bet is made, the last player holding
cards takes the pool without showing his hand. If a bet is
made, each player in turn on the left must abdicate, better, or call,
just as in the ordinary pool. At the conclusion of the betting, if
there is a call, the best poker hand wins, of course. If there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
call, the player making the last bet or raise takes the pool without
showing his hand, unless he is the opener, when the whole hand
need not be shown, as it is no one’s business what the opener got
in the draw, no one having paid to see it. All he need show is
openers. But should the opener be one of those in the final call,
he must show his whole hand. Should it then be discovered that
he has not openers, the false opener is compelled to ante for all
the players at the table for another Jack. This is usually called
giving them a “free ride.”</p>

<p><i><b>The Kitty</b></i> is now an almost universal adjunct to the pool. In
clubs, it pays for the cards, and for an occasional round of refreshments;
in small poker parties it defrays the expense of the
weekly supper. When the amount is excessive, or accumulates
too rapidly, it is often used to give the players a “free ride” by
paying all their antes in a “kitty jack pot.”</p>

<p>The kitty is usually kept by the banker, who takes a white
counter out of every pool in which triplets or better are shown to
the board, and a red counter out of every jack pot. These
counters must be kept apart from the other chips, and must be
accounted for at the end of the game by paying the kitty so much
in cash, just as if it was one of the players.</p>

<p>Gambling houses and poker rooms are supposed to derive their
entire revenue from this source, and those of the lowest class invent
endless excuses for taking out for the kitty. In many houses
there is a sliding scale for various hands; one counter being taken
for two pairs; two counters for triplets; three for straights or
flushes; and a red for fours, jack pots, and misdeals. It is not
uncommon for the proprietors of such games to find thirty or forty
dollars in the kitty after a night’s play with five-cent chips.</p>

<p><i><b>TABLE STAKES.</b></i> This is one of several variations in arranging
the stakes and the betting limit. In some localities it is
the custom to allow each player to purchase as many counters as
he pleases; in others it is the rule to compel each to buy an equal
number at the start, usually two hundred times the amount of the
blind. In table stakes the betting limit is always the amount that
the player has in front of him; but no player is allowed either
to increase or diminish that amount while he has any cards in
front of him. Before the cards are dealt for any pool he may announce
that he wishes to buy counters, or that he has some to sell
to any other player wishing to purchase; but for either transaction
the consent of all the other players must be obtained. No
player is allowed under any circumstances to borrow from another,
nor to be “shy” in any pot; that is, to say, “I owe so many.” If
he has any counters in front of him, his betting is limited to what
he has; if he has none, he is out of the game, for that hand at
least. As a player cannot increase the amount he has in front of
him during the play of a hand, it is best to keep on the table at all
times as much as one is likely to want to bet on any one hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the usual custom, and an excellent one, to fix upon a definite
hour for closing a game of table stakes, and to allow no player
to retire from the game before that hour unless he is <i><b>decavé</b></i>,
(has lost all his capital). Should he insist on retiring, whatever
counters he has must be divided among the other players, and if
there are any odd ones after the division, they must be put into the
current pool.</p>

<p>In table stakes, any player may <i><b>call a sight</b></i> for what money or
counters he has in front of him, even should another player have
bet a much larger amount. For instance: A has bet three dollars,
and B has only two dollars in front of him, but wishes to call A.
B calls for a sight by putting his two dollars in the pool, and A
must then withdraw his third dollar from the pool, but leave it on
the table to be called or raised by any other player. Should C
wish to call A, or even to raise him, A and C may continue the
betting independently of B’s part of the pool. Should C have even
less money than B, say one dollar, he may still further reduce the
original pool, leaving the two dollars aside for settlement between
A and B, and A’s third dollar still aside from that again for the
decision of any other player.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that A and C continue the betting until one calls.
When the hands are shown, if either A’s or C’s is better than B’s,
B loses his interest; but if B’s hand is better than either A’s hand
or C’s hand, he takes the part of the pool for which he called a
sight, while A and C decide the remainder between them. For
instance: A calls C, and C shows three tens. Neither A nor B
can beat it, and C takes everything. But if B had three Jacks,
and A only three fives, B would take the part of the pool for which
he called a sight, and C would take the remainder.</p>

<p>Should C have raised and bluffed A out, or have bet so much
that A finally refused to call, A would have no interest in either
pool, and C would take all the money outside the pool for which
B called a sight. Should it then transpire, on the show of hands
between B and C, that A had laid down a better hand than either
of them, that would not entitle A to claim the sight pool from B,
because in laying down his hand he has practically acknowledged
that C’s hand is better, and has retired from the game. If B’s
hand is better than C’s, B takes the sight pool.</p>

<p><i><b>FREEZE OUT.</b></i> This might be called a variety of table
stakes. At the start, each player is supplied with an equal number
of counters; but no one is allowed to replenish his stock, or to
withdraw or loan any part of it. As soon as any player has lost
his capital he is decavé, or <i><b>frozen out</b></i>, and must permanently
retire from the game. The other players continue until only one
remains, who must of course win everything on the table. This is
not a popular form of Poker, because it is sometimes a long time
before a player who is frozen out can get into a game again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>SHOW-DOWN POKER.</b></i> This is a variety of draw poker,
in which each player takes the five cards dealt to him and turns
them face up so that all the other players can see them. Each
player discards and draws in turn, eldest hand first. As soon as a
hand is beaten it is thrown into the deadwood, all the cards drawn
being dealt face up.</p>

<p><i><b>FLAT POKER.</b></i> In this variety of the game, before the
cards are dealt, the age puts up, for a blind, any amount he pleases
within the limit. Those who are willing to bet a similar amount
on the possibilities of their hands put up a similar amount. Those
who decline are not given any cards. There are no straddles,
raises, or antes. Immediately after the deal each player who is in
the pool draws cards, the age first. There are then two ways to
play: The hands are shown and the best wins; or, beginning with
the age, each player may say if he will back his hand against the
field; <i>i.e.</i>, all the others in the pool. If he will, he must put up as
much as their combined stakes. He cannot be raised; but if any
one player or combination of players call him, and one of them
can beat his hand, the field divide the pool. For instance: Age
makes it a blue, and three others stay with him. After the draw
C puts up three blues against the field. D and A call it, and all
show hands. If any of the three, A, B or D can beat C they
divide the pool, B getting his third, although he did not contribute
to the call. This game is a pure gamble; except that a bold
player may occasionally bluff the field off.</p>

<p><i><b>METHODS OF CHEATING.</b></i> Poker and its congeners
have received more attention from the greeks than any other
family of card games. In fact it is generally believed that the
term greek, as applied to a card sharper, had its origin in the
Adam of the poker family, which was a gambling game introduced
by the Greeks in Italy.</p>

<p>So numerous and so varied are the methods of cheating at
Poker that it is an axiom among gamblers that if a pigeon will not
stand one thing he will another. The best informed make it a
rule never to play Poker with strangers, because they realize that it
is impossible for any but a professional gambler to know half the
tricks employed by the poker sharp. It is a notorious fact that
even the shrewdest gamblers are continually being taken in by
others more expert than themselves. What chance then has the
honest card player?</p>

<p>There are black sheep in all flocks, and it may be well to give a
few hints to those who are in the habit of playing in mixed companies.</p>

<p>Never play with a man who looks attentively at the faces of the
cards as he gathers them for his deal; or who stands the pack on
edge, with the faces of the cards towards him, and evens up the
bunch by picking out certain cards, apparently because they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
sticking up. Any pack can be straightened by pushing the cards
down with the hand. The man who lifts them up is more than
probably a cheat.</p>

<p>Never play with a man who looks intently at the pack and
shuffles the cards slowly. If he is not locating the cards for the
ensuing deal he is wasting time, and should be hurried a little.</p>

<p>Never play with a person who leaves the cut portion of the pack
on the table, and deals off the other part. In small parties this is
a very common way of working what is known as <i><b>the top stock</b></i>.
If such a dealer is carefully watched it will usually be found that
he seizes the first opportunity to place the part cut off on the top
of the part dealt from. The top stock is then ready for the draw,
and the judicious player should at once cash his chips and retire
from the game.</p>

<p>Never play with a man who continually holds his cards very close
to his body, or who completely conceals his hand before the draw,
or who takes great care to put his discard among previous discards,
so that the exact number of cards put out cannot be counted. He
is probably working a vest or sleeve hold-out. Some clumsy or
audacious sharpers will go so far as to hold out cards in their lap, or
stick them in a “bug” under the table. One of the most successful
poker sharps ever known, “Eat-um-up Jake” Blackburn, who
had a hand like a ham, could hold out five cards in his palm while
he carried on all the operations of shuffling, dealing, and playing
his hand. Such men require great dexterity and nerve to get rid
of their “deadwood,” or surplus cards, without detection. <i><b>Holding
out</b></i> is regarded by the professional as a most dangerous experiment,
but it is very common.</p>

<p>Never play with a man who keeps his eyes rivetted on the cards
as he deals, and who deals comparatively slowly. He is probably
using marked cards, or has marked the important ones himself during
the play. Poker sharps who mark cards by scratching them
with a sharp point concealed in a ring are obliged to hold the cards
at a certain angle to the light in order to see the scratches. Those
who dig points in the cards with the thumb nail depend on touch
instead of sight. If you find such points on the cards, either dig
other points on other cards, or retire from the game.</p>

<p>Against the hold-out or marked cards there is no protection, because
the dealer does not care how much the cards in the pack are
shuffled or cut; but every method of running up hands, or stocking
cards, can be made ineffective if the pone will not only cut the
cards, but carefully reunite the packets. If the two parts are
straightened after the cut, it will be impossible for the dealer to
shift the cut, and bring the cards back to their original position.
The dealer will sometimes bend the top or bottom card so as to
form a <i><b>bridge</b></i>, which will enable him to find the place where the
cards were cut. This can only be overcome by shuffling the cards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
instead of cutting them, which every player has the right to do. If
you insist on shuffling, the greek will do the same in his turn, and
will run up hands to be dealt to himself. It is perfectly useless
to endeavour to protect yourself against a poker sharp; the only
remedy is to leave the game.</p>

<p>Many persons have a strong prejudice against playing with a
man who shuffles his chips. The mere fact of his being an expert
at chip shuffling has nothing to do with the game of poker, the
accomplishment usually being the result of long experience at the
faro table. The reason for the prejudice is that a chip shuffler is
usually cold blooded, courageous, and seldom a loser at any game
that requires nerve.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> Volumes might
be written for the guidance of the poker player without improving
his game a particle, unless he possesses at least one of four qualifications:
Control over his features and actions; judgment of
human nature; courage; and patience. The man whose face or
manner betrays the nature of his hand, or the effect of an opponent’s
bet or raise, will find everyone to beat his weak hands, and
no one to call his strong ones. Unless he is a fair judge of human
nature he will never be able to estimate the strength or peculiarities
of the players to whom he is opposed, and will fail to distinguish
a bluff from an ambuscade. Without courage he cannot
reap the full benefit of his good hands; and without patience he
cannot save his money in the time of adversity.</p>

<p>Of one thing every player may rest assured, and that is that
Poker cannot be played by mathematical formulas. Beyond the
most elementary calculations of the chances in favour of certain
events the theory of probabilities is of no assistance. It is not
necessary to call in a mathematician to prove that a player who
habitually discards a pair of aces to draw to three cards of a suit
will lose by the operation in the long run. Nor will any amount
of calculation convince some players that they are wasting their
money to stay in a jack pot in order to draw to a pair of tens,
although such is the fact.</p>

<p>The various positions occupied by the player at the poker table
may be briefly examined, and some general suggestions offered
for his guidance in each of them. In the first place he should
look out for his counters. It is always best for each player to place
the amount of his ante or his bet immediately in front of him, so
that there need be no dispute as to who is up, or who is shy.
Above all it should be insisted that any player who has once put
counters in the pool, and taken his hand from them, should not
again take them down.</p>

<p><i><b>The Age</b></i> is the most valuable position at the table, but it is
seldom fully taken advantage of. The age should never look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
his hand until it is his turn to make good his blind. He may pick
up his cards, but he should use his eyes in following the manner
and facial expression of the other players as they sort their cards.
One of the greatest errors made by the age is in thinking that he
must save his blind. The player who draws to nothing because
he can do so cheaply, will usually have nothing to draw at the end
of the game. The age can usually afford to draw to four-card
flushes, and to straights open at both ends, but should not do so
when there are less than three who have paid to draw cards, or
when the ante has been raised.</p>

<p>If the age holds Kings or better before the draw, he should invariably
raise the ante unless there are five players in the pool besides
himself, or unless some other player has already raised. If
he holds two pairs, he should do all his betting before the draw.
If any other player has raised, or his own raise is re-raised, the age
must use his judgment of the player and the circumstances. It is
useless for the age to disguise his hand by such manœuvres as
holding up an odd card to a pair, unless he raises the blind at the
same time. If he draws one or two cards only, and has not raised
the blind, every one will credit him for a small pair and an ace, or
for a bobtail, and will inevitably call any bluff he may make. The
age is the poorest position at the table for a bluff, but it is decidedly
the best in which to win large pots with moderate hands.</p>

<p><i><b>The Dealer</b></i> has the next best position to the age, and in large
parties there is very little difference in the way in which the two
positions should be played.</p>

<p>The <i><b>first bettor</b></i> has the worst position at the table and he
should seldom come in on less than Queens. He should seldom
raise the ante, even with two pairs, as he will only drive others
out. In this position very little can be made out of good hands,
because every one expects to find them there; but it offers many
excellent opportunities for successful bluffing. A player in this
position should never straddle. Many players endeavour to force
their luck in this way, but it is a losing game, and the best players
seldom or never straddle. Having to make the first bet after the
draw, it is usual for the player in this position, if he has an average
hand, to <i><b>chip along</b></i>, by simply betting a single counter, and
waiting for developments. With a strong hand, it is best to bet
its full value at once, on the chance that the bet may be taken for
a bluff, and called.</p>

<p><i><b>Other Positions.</b></i> As the positions go round the table from
the first bettor to the age, they become more desirable, and little
need be said of them beyond the consideration of the average
strength necessary for a player to <i><b>go in</b></i> on.</p>

<p><i><b>GOING IN.</b></i> There is a great difference of opinion as to the
minimum value of a hand which should justify a player in drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
cards if he can do so for the usual ante. In close games
many players make it a rule not to go in on less than tens, while
in more liberal circles the players will draw to any pair. In
determining which course to follow, the individual must be guided
by his observation and judgment. Suppose five play, and A
observes that B and C constantly draw to small pairs, while D
and E never come in on less than tens. If A has the age, B, D,
and E having anted, A may be sure that there are at least two
good hands against him, and will guide himself accordingly. But
if B and C are the only players in, A may safely draw to a small
pair. It can be mathematically demonstrated that what is called
an <i><b>average go-in hand</b></i> should be at least a pair of tens; but
a player who waits for tens in a liberal game, in which others are
drawing to ace high, will ante himself away if there are many jack
pots, and will get no calls when he gets a hand.</p>

<p><i><b>BETTING.</b></i> Good players are guided by the general character
of the game in which they take part. Some parties play a
very liberal game, and the players bet high on medium hands, and
give every one a good fight. It is best to have liberal or lucky
players on your right; because if they sit behind you, they will
continually raise you, and you will be forced either to overbid
your hand on the same liberal scale that they adopt, or lose what
you have already put up. If a liberal player sits on your right
you will often be able to make large winnings on moderate hands.
In a close game, when the players bet in a niggardly manner, the
liberal player is at a great disadvantage; for he can win little or
nothing on his good hands, but will lose large amounts when he
runs up the betting on a good hand which is opposed to one that
is better. When a liberal player finds a close player following
him freely, he may be sure there is a very strong hand against
him.</p>

<p><i><b>VARIETY.</b></i> Above all things a player should avoid regularity
in his play, because observant adversaries will soon learn his
methods. The best players usually play two pairs pat, without
drawing, about half the time. This gives them the reputation of
betting on pat hands which are not genuine, and when they get
one that is real, they will often succeed in getting a good bet, or
even a raise, from those holding triplets or two large pairs, who
have noticed them play two pairs pat. In the same way it is
advisable to hold up an odd card occasionally, without raising the
ante; so that when you do hold triplets, and draw two cards, you
will not frighten every one at the table. The chances of improving
a pair by drawing three cards, are one in three; and by drawing
two cards only, one in four. The difference is worth the moral
effect of the variation in the play.</p>

<p><i><b>PROBABILITIES.</b></i> The endless poker statistics that
have been published are of little or no value to the practical player<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>,
and there are only a few figures that are worth remembering. It
is a general law in all games of chance that you should never do a
thing which you would not be willing to repeat under the same
circumstances a hundred times. The best example of the application
of this law is in drawing to bobtails. If you have a four-card
flush to draw to, the odds against getting it are about four to
one; and unless you can obtain the privilege of drawing to it by
paying not more than one-fifth of the amount in the pool, you will
lose by it in the long run. The best players never draw to four-card
flushes except when they have the age, and the ante has not
been raised.</p>

<p>There are some players who pretend to be so guided by probabilities
that they never go into a pool unless the chances in favour
of their having a good hand after the draw are at least equal to
the odds they have to bet by going into the pool. This is all
nonsense; for no player knows when he goes into a pool how
much it will cost him to get out, and the value of his individual
hand is an unknown quantity at the best, because it cannot be
compared to the others. One thing only is certain, and that is
that in the long run the player who goes in with the strongest
hand will still have the strongest hand after the draw. This is an
important thing to remember in jack pots, in which the value of
at least one hand is known. If you draw to a pair smaller than
Jacks, you do so with the full knowledge that the pair itself is not
strong enough to win. Now what are the odds against your winning
the pool? Suppose you hold tens, and draw three cards. Your
chance of improving your hand is a little better than one in five.
The opener of the jack pot has exactly the same chance, and if both
of you draw cards a hundred times under those circumstances, he
will beat you in the long run, to say nothing of the other players
who may come in and beat both of you. It is therefore evident
that in backing tens against openers, it is four to one against your
beating the openers to begin with, and if you do beat them the
odds are still against your winning the pot. If there were five
players, and the jack pots were all equal in amount, you would
have to win one pot out of five to make your investment pay.
Can you make this average when your original pair will not beat
openers?</p>

<p>There are three principles with regard to the draw that should
never be lost sight of:</p>

<p>(1) An average go-in hand is a hand which will win its proportion
of the pools, according to the number playing, taking all
improvements and opposition into account. This can be demonstrated
to be a pair of tens.</p>

<p>(2) The draw is much more valuable to a weak hand than to a
strong one, and weak hands will improve in much greater proportion
than strong ones will. For instance: The chances for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
player to improve by drawing to a pair of Queens are one in three
and a half. He may make two pairs, or triplets, or a full hand, or
four of a kind. The chances of improvement for a player drawing
to two pairs, say Eights up, are only one in thirteen. This consideration
leads players to adopt two lines of play: To bet all they
intend to on two pairs before the draw, in order to prevent weaker
hands drawing cards and improving; or, to discard the smaller
pair in order to increase their chances of improvement.</p>

<p>(3) The smaller the number of players, the greater the value of
the hands; and the larger the number of players, the greater the
chance that any given hand will be beaten. When only two play,
you can safely bet the limit on a pair of Eights; but in a party of
eight players they are hardly worth drawing to. For this reason
average hands should force the weaker out, and reduce the number
of players <i><b>before the draw</b></i>.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those interested in such matters <i><b>the probable
improvement by the draw</b></i> may be briefly given.</p>

<p>It is 2½ to 1 against improving <i><b>a pair</b></i> by drawing three
cards; the chances against making triplets or two pairs being 8 to
1; against a full hand, 61 to 1; and against four of a kind, 364 to 1.
It is 4 to 1 against improving a pair by drawing two cards; the
chances against triplets being 12 to 1, and 8 to 1 against two pairs.</p>

<p>It is 12 to 1 against making a full hand by drawing to <i><b>two
pairs</b></i>.</p>

<p>It is 8 to 1 against improving <i><b>triplets</b></i> by drawing two cards;
14½ to 1 against a full hand, and 23 to 1 against four of a kind.
It is 12 to 1 against improving if one card is drawn; 16 to 1 against
the full, and 46 to 1 against four of a kind.</p>

<p>It is 11 to 1 against making a straight out of a sequence of four
cards which is open in the middle, or at one end only. It is 5 to 1
against making a straight out of a sequence of four which is open
at both ends.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p235.jpg" width="500" height="75" alt="🂻 🃚 🂨 🂧 | 🂹 🃘 🂧 🃆" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap spacer">In-between Straight.</span> <span class="smcap spacer">Open-end Straight.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It is 4½ to 1 against filling a four-card flush. It is 23 to 1
against filling a three-card flush. It is 95 to 1 against filling a two-card
flush.</p>

<p>It is 3 to 1 against improving a four-card straight flush which is
open at both ends. The chances against getting the straight or
the flush have been given; the odds against getting the straight
flush are 24 to 1. The chance for getting a pair exists; but the
pair would probably be worthless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>It is 4 to 1 against improving a four-card straight flush open in
the middle, or at one end only; the odds against getting the
straight flush being 46 to 1.</p>

<p>There are several minor or speculative draws which may be of
interest. Drawing to an ace and a King, it is 3 to 1 against making
a pair of either. It is 4 to 1 against making a pair of aces by
drawing four cards to an ace; and 12 to 1 against making aces
up, or better. It is 24 to 1 against making a straight by drawing to
three cards of it, open at both ends. It is 12 to 1 against making
either a straight or a flush by drawing to three cards of a
straight flush, open at both ends.</p>

<p><i><b>HOW TO WIN AT POKER.</b></i> There have been many
alleged infallible receipts for winning at Poker. Proctor thought
that refusing to go in on less than triplets would prove a certainty;
but in the same paragraph he acknowledges that the adversaries
would soon learn the peculiarity, and avoid betting against the
player. Triplets before the draw occur about once in every 45
hands. If five were playing, a person following Proctor’s advice
would have to blind 9 times, and ante in at least 12 jack pots in
every 45 hands, to say nothing of fattening. This means an outlay
of at least 75 counters. When the triplets come, will he get
back 75 counters on them? He will probably win the blind, and
one or two antes; but the moment he makes his own ante good,
every player who cannot beat triplets, knowing his system, will
lay down his hand.</p>

<p>An extensive observation of the methods of the best players
has led the author to the conclusion that the great secret of success
in Poker, apart from natural aptitude for the game, and being
a good actor, is to <i><b>avoid calling</b></i>. If you think you have the
best hand, raise. If you think you have not the best, lay it down.
Although you may sometimes lay down a better hand than the
one that takes the pool, the system will prove of immense advantage
to you in two ways: In the first place, you will find it a great
educator of the judgment; and in the second place, it will take
almost any opponent’s nerve. Once an adversary has learned
your method, it is not a question of his betting a red chip on his
hand; but of his willingness to stand a raise of two blues, which
he will regard as inevitable if you come in against him at all. The
fear of this raise will prompt many a player to lay down a moderately
good hand without a bet; so that you have all the advantage
of having made a strong bluff without having put up a chip. The
system will also drive all but the most courageous to calling your
hand on every occasion, being afraid of a further and inevitable
raise; and it is an old saying that a good caller is a sure loser.</p>

<p>The theory of calling is to get an opportunity to compare your
hand with your adversary’s. Now, if you think that after the
comparison yours will prove the better hand, why not increase the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
value of the pool? If, on the contrary, you fear that his hand
will beat yours, why throw good money after bad? If you don’t
think at all about it, and have no means of forming an opinion as
to the respective merits of your hands, you are not a poker player,
and have no business in the game.</p>

<p><i><b>BLUFFING.</b></i> There is nothing connected with Poker on
which persons have such confused ideas as on the subject of bluffing.
The popular impression seems to be that a stiff upper lip,
and a cheerful expression of countenance, accompanied by a bet
of five dollars, will make most people lay down three aces; and
that this result will be brought about by the five-dollar bet, without
any regard to the player’s position at the table, the number of
cards he drew, his manner of seeing or raising the ante, or the
play of his adversaries before the draw. The truth of the matter
is that for a bluff to be either sound in principle or successful in
practice, the player must carefully select his opportunity. The
bluff must be planned from the start, and consistently played from
the ante to the end. To use a common expression: “The play
must be right for it, or the bluff will be wrong.”</p>

<p>There are many cases in which a bluff of fifty cents would be
much stronger than one of five dollars; the difference depending
on the player’s position at the table, his treatment of the ante, and
the number of cards he had drawn. As an example of the play
being right for a bluff, take the following case: Five play in a
jack pot. A and B have passed when C opens it for the limit. D
and E pass out, but A and B both stay, and each draws one card.
C takes two cards, and as it is his first bet he puts up the limit on
his three aces. A drops out, but B raises C the limit in return.
Now, if C is a good player he will lay down his three aces, even if
he faintly suspects B is bluffing, because B’s play is sound in any
case. He either could not, or pretended he could not open the
jack; but he could afford to pay the limit to draw one card against
openers, and he could afford to raise the limit against an opener’s
evidently honest two-card draw. As a matter of fact the whole
play was a bluff; for B not only had nothing, but had nothing to
draw to originally.</p>

<p>Another variety of the bluff, which is the author’s own invention,
will often prove successful with strangers, but it can seldom be
repeated in the same company. Suppose six play in a jack pot.
A passes, and B opens it by quietly putting up his counters. C
and D pass, and E, pretending not to know that B has opened it,
announces that he will open it for the limit, although he has not a
pair in his hand. He is of course immediately informed that it
has been opened, upon which he unhesitatingly raises it for the
limit. Whatever the others do, E stands pat, and looks cheerful.
The author has never known this bluff to be called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Holding a strong hand, a player may often coax another to
raise him, by offering to divide the pool.</p>

<p>The successful bluffer should never show his hand. Even if he
starts the game by bluffing for advertising purposes, hoping to
get called on good hands later, he should not show anything or
tell anything that the others do not pay to see or know. Bluffing
is usually more successful when a player is in a lucky vein than
when he has been unfortunate.</p>

<h3>POKER LAWS.</h3>

<p><i><b>1. Formation of Table.</b></i> A poker table is complete with
seven players. If eight play the dealer must take no cards, or a
sixty-card pack must be used. If there are more than seven candidates
for play, two tables must be formed unless the majority
decide against it.</p>

<p><i><b>2. Cutting.</b></i> The players who shall form the table, and their
positions at the beginning of the game may be decided by drawing
from an outspread pack, or by throwing round a card to each candidate,
face up. If there are eight or more candidates, the tables
shall divide evenly if the number is even, those cutting the highest
cards playing together. If the number is odd, the smaller table
shall be formed by those cutting the highest cards. In cutting,
the ace is low. Any player exposing more than one card must
cut again.</p>

<p><i><b>3.</b></i> The table formed, the players draw from the outspread pack
for positions. The lowest cut has the first choice, and deals the
first hand. The player cutting the next lowest has the next choice,
and so on until all are seated.</p>

<p><i><b>4. Ties.</b></i> If players cut cards of equal value they must cut
again; but the new cut decides nothing but the tie.</p>

<p><i><b>5. Stakes.</b></i> Any player may be the banker, and keep the kitty,
if any. In Draw, Straight, or Stud Poker, each player may purchase
as many counters as he pleases. In Freeze-out, Table
Stakes, Whiskey Poker, and Progressive Poker, each player must
begin with an equal amount.</p>

<p><i><b>6. Betting Limits.</b></i> Before play begins limits must be
agreed upon for the amount of the blind, the straddle, the ante in
jack pots, and for betting or raising.</p>

<p><i><b>7. Shuffling.</b></i> Before the first deal the pack must be counted
to see that it contains the proper number of cards. Should the
first dealer neglect this he forfeits five counters to the pool. Before
each deal the cards must be shuffled. Any player may shuffle,
the dealer last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>8. Cutting to the Dealer.</b></i> The dealer must present the pack
to the pone, [the player on his right,] to be cut. The pone may
either cut, or signify that he does not wish to do so, by tapping the
pack with his knuckles. Should the pone decline to cut, no other
player can insist on his doing so, nor do it for him. If he cuts, he
must leave at least four cards in each packet, and the dealer or
the pone must reunite the packets by placing the one not removed
in cutting upon the other.</p>

<p><i><b>9.</b></i> If in cutting, or in reuniting the packets, a card is exposed,
the pack must be reshuffled and cut.</p>

<p><i><b>10.</b></i> If the dealer reshuffles the pack after it has been properly
cut, he forfeits five counters to the current pool.</p>

<p><i><b>11. Dealing Before the Draw.</b></i> After the age, [the
player on the dealer’s left,] has put up the amount of the blind, the
dealer distributes the cards face down, one at a time, in rotation,
until each player has received five cards.</p>

<p><i><b>12.</b></i> The deal passes to the left, except in jack pots, when it may
be agreed that the same dealer shall deal until the pot is opened.</p>

<p><i><b>13. Misdealing.</b></i> A misdeal does not lose the deal; the
same dealer must deal again. It is a misdeal: If the dealer fails
to present the pack to the pone; or if any card is found faced in
the pack; or if the pack is found imperfect; or if the dealer gives
six or more cards to more than one player; or if he deals more or
fewer hands than there are players; or if he omits a player in
dealing; or if he deals a card incorrectly, and fails to correct the
error before dealing another.</p>

<p><i><b>14. Irregularities in the Hands.</b></i> Should the dealer, or
the wind, turn over any card, the player to whom it is dealt must
take it; but the same player cannot be compelled to take two exposed
cards. Should such a combination occur there must be a
new deal. If the player exposes cards himself, he has no remedy.</p>

<p><i><b>15.</b></i> Should any player receive more or less than his proper number
of cards, and discover the error before he looks at any card in
his hand, or lifts it from the table, he may demand a new deal if
no bet has been made; or he may ask the dealer to give him another
card from the pack if he has too few, or to draw a card if he
has too many. Cards so drawn must not be exposed, but should
be placed on the top of the pack. If a bet has been made, there
must be a new deal. Should the player take up his hand, or look
at any card in it, he has no remedy.</p>

<p><i><b>16.</b></i> Should a player take up a hand containing more or less
than five cards, or look at any card in it, such a hand is foul, and
he must abandon it, forfeiting any interest he may have in that
pool. If one player has six cards and his neighbour four, neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
having lifted or looked at any card, the dealer may be called upon
to draw a card from the six hand and give it to the four hand.</p>

<p><i><b>17. Straddling.</b></i> During the deal, or at any time before he
looks at any card in his hand, the player to the left of the age may
straddle the blind by putting up double the amount put up by
the age. Should he straddle, the player on his left may double
the amount again, provided he has not seen any of his cards; and
so on, until the limit of the straddling is reached. This limit must
not exceed one-fourth of the betting limit. Should any player in
his turn refuse to straddle, no other player on his left can straddle.</p>

<p><i><b>18. The Ante.</b></i> After the cards are dealt, each player in turn,
beginning with the one to the left of the age, or to the left of the
last straddler, if any, must either abandon his hand or put into the
pool twice the amount of the blind, or of the last straddle. When
it comes to the turn of the age, and the straddlers, if any, they
must either abandon their hands, or make the amount they have
in the pool equal to twice the amount of the blind, or of the last
straddle, if any.</p>

<p><i><b>19. Raising the Ante.</b></i> Each player, when it is his turn
to come in, may add to the amount of the ante any sum within the
betting limit. This will compel any player coming in after him to
equal the total of the ante and the raise, or to abandon his hand;
and it will also give such following player the privilege of raising
again by any further amount within the betting limit. Should any
player decline to equal the amount put up by any previous player,
he must abandon his hand, together with all his interest in that
pool. Any player who has been raised in this manner may raise
again in his turn; and not until each player holding cards has anted
an equal amount will the game proceed.</p>

<p><i><b>20. Winning the Antes.</b></i> Should any player have put up
an amount which no other player will equal, he takes whatever
counters are then in the pool, without showing his hand, and the
deal passes to the next player on the dealer’s left. Should only
one player come in, and the age decline to make good his ante, the
player who has come in wins the blind, unless jack pots are
played. Should any player have straddled the blind, or raised the
ante, there can be no jack pot.</p>

<p><i><b>21. Making Jacks.</b></i> If no player will come in, it is a
Natural Jack, and all the hands must be abandoned, each player
putting up for the ensuing deal the amount agreed upon. If no
one has straddled the blind, or raised the ante, and only one player
has come in, the age may do one of four things: He may forfeit
his blind; or he may make the ante good; or he may raise it; or he
may demand that the single player who has come in shall take
down his ante, the age putting up twice the amount agreed upon
for jack pots; once for himself, and once for the player who came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
in. All the other players must then put up for the ensuing deal.
This is an Only-Two-In Jack.</p>

<p><i><b>22. Drawing Cards.</b></i> When two or more players have
come in for an equal amount, the others having abandoned their
hands, each of them in turn, beginning with the one on the
dealer’s left, may discard any or all of the cards originally dealt
him, and draw others in their place. The number discarded and
drawn, if any, must be distinctly announced by each player, including
the dealer; and the fresh cards must be given face down from
the top of the pack, without any further shuffling or cutting. Each
player must receive the entire number he asks for before the next
player is helped. No player shall receive from the dealer more or
fewer than he discards; so that if he is playing with a short hand,
such as four cards only, he will still have four cards after the
draw; and if his hand was originally foul, it will so remain.</p>

<p><i><b>23. Exposed Cards.</b></i> In dealing for the draw, should any
card be found faced in the pack, or should any card be exposed by
the dealer in giving out the cards, or be blown over by the wind
before the player has touched it, such cards must be placed on the
table with the discards. The player whose card has been exposed
does not receive another in its place until all the other players,
including the dealer, have been helped.</p>

<p><i><b>24. Incorrect Draws.</b></i> Should any player ask for an incorrect
number of cards, he must take them; unless he discovers
the error before the next player has been helped. If too many
have been asked for, he must discard before seeing them. If too
few, and he lifts any of them, he holds a foul hand. No player is
allowed to take back into his hand any card that has once been
discarded. If he has taken up the cards, or has seen any of them,
and has too many, his hand is foul, and must be abandoned. If
the dealer gives himself more cards than he needs, he must take
them; but if less, he can supply the deficiency, provided he has
not looked at any of the drawn cards.</p>

<p><i><b>25. Incorrect Dealing.</b></i> Should the dealer give any player
more or fewer cards than he asks for, and the player discover the
error before taking them up or seeing any of them, the dealer
must withdraw the surplus card, and place it on the top of the
pack. Should the dealer give a player fewer cards than he asks
for, he must supply the deficiency when his attention is called to
it, without waiting to supply the other players. Should the dealer
give cards to any player out of his proper turn, he may correct the
error if none of the cards have been seen; not otherwise.</p>

<p><i><b>26. The Last Card</b></i> of the pack must not be dealt. When
only two cards remain, and more than one is asked for, they must
be mixed with the discards and abandoned hands, and the whole
shuffled together, and presented to the pone to be cut. Discards
of those who have yet to draw must not be gathered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>27.</b></i> After the cards have been delivered by the dealer, no
player has the right to be informed how many cards any player
drew; and any person, bystander or player, volunteering the information,
except the player himself, may be called upon to pay to
the player against whom he informs an amount equal to that then
in the pool. Any player who has made good the ante and drawn
cards may, before making a bet, ask how many cards the dealer
drew, and the dealer must inform him.</p>

<p><i><b>28. Betting After the Draw.</b></i> The first player who holds
cards on the left of the age must make the first bet, whether he
has straddled or not. If he declines to bet he must abandon his
hand. The fact that the age is not playing makes no difference,
as his privilege cannot be transferred to any other player. Bets
may vary in amount from one counter to the betting limit. If no
player will bet, the age takes the pool without showing his hand;
or, if he has passed out before the draw, the last player on his
right who holds cards wins the pool.</p>

<p><i><b>29. Raising the Bets.</b></i> Should any player make a bet,
each player in turn on his left must either bet an equal amount or
abandon his hand. Should any player bet an equal amount, he
has the privilege of increasing the bet to any further sum within
the betting limit. The players on his left must then either meet
the total amount of the original bet and the raise, or abandon their
hands. Any player meeting the amount already bet has the privilege
of increasing it to any further amount within the limit, and so
on, until no further raises take place. Any player whose bet has
been raised must abandon his hand or meet the raise, with the
privilege of raising again in return. Should one player make a bet
or raise which no other player will see, he takes the pool without
showing his hand, and the cards are shuffled and cut for the next
deal.</p>

<p><i><b>30. Calling the Bets.</b></i> As long as one player raises another’s
bets, he gives that player the privilege of raising him
again; but if a player who has made a bet is not raised, the others
simply betting an equal amount, the first bettor is called, and all
betting must cease. The players must then show their hands to
the table, in order to decide which wins the pool.</p>

<p><i><b>31.</b></i> Bets must be actually made by placing the counters in the
pool, and no bet is made until the player’s hand has been withdrawn
from the counters. Any counters once placed in the pool,
and the owner’s hand withdrawn, cannot be taken down again, except
by the winner of the pool.</p>

<p><i><b>32. Betting Out of Turn.</b></i> Should any player bet out of
his turn, he cannot take down his counters again if he has removed
his hand from them. Should the player whose proper turn it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
raise the bet, the player who bet out of turn must either meet the
raise or abandon his hand, and all interest in that pool.</p>

<p><i><b>33. Mouth Bets.</b></i> Any player stating that he bets a certain
amount, but failing to put up the actual counters in the pool,
cannot be called upon to make the amount good after the hands
are shown, or the pool is won. If the players opposed to him
choose to accept a mouth bet against the counters they have already
put up, they have no remedy, as no value is attached to
what a player says; his cards and his counters speak for themselves.
Any player wishing to raise a mouth bet has the privilege
of raising by mouth, instead of by counters; but he cannot be
called upon to make the amount good after the hands are shown,
or the pool has been won.</p>

<p><i><b>34. Showing Hands.</b></i> When a call is made, all the hands
must be shown to the table, and the best poker hand wins the
pool. Any player declining to show his hand, even though he
admits that it is not good, must pay an amount equal to the ante
to each of the players at the table; or, if jack pots are played, he
must put up for all of them in the next jack pot. When the
hands are called, there is no penalty for mis-calling a hand; the
cards, like the counters, speak for themselves.</p>

<p><i><b>35. Rank of the Hands.</b></i> The best poker hand is a
<i><b>Royal Flush</b></i>; A K Q J 10 of the same suit, which beats a</p>

<p><i><b>Straight Flush</b></i>; any sequence of five cards of the same suit.</p>

<p><i><b>Four of a Kind</b></i>; such as four 10’s and an odd card.</p>

<p><i><b>Full Hand</b></i>; three of a kind and a pair, such as three 8’s and
a pair of Q’s, which beats a</p>

<p><i><b>Flush</b></i>; five cards of the same suit, but not in sequence.</p>

<p><i><b>Straight</b></i>; five cards in sequence, but of various suits. In
straights, the Ace cannot be used to form such combinations as Q
K A 2 3; but it may be used as the bottom of 5 4 3 2, or the top
of 10 J Q K. Straights beat</p>

<p><i><b>Three of a Kind</b></i>; such as three K’s and two odd cards.</p>

<p><i><b>Two Pairs</b></i>; such as two 9’s and two 7’s, with an odd card.</p>

<p><i><b>A Pair</b></i>; such as two Aces and three odd cards.</p>

<p>If no pair is shown, the <i><b>Highest Card</b></i> wins.</p>

<p>A short hand, such as four cards, cannot be claimed as either a
straight or a flush.</p>

<p><i><b>36. Ties.</b></i> In case of ties, the highest of the odd cards decides
it. Ultimate ties must divide the pool. When combinations
of equal rank are shown, the one containing the highest cards wins,
the rank of the cards being, A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2; so that
two pairs, K’s and 4’s, will beat two pairs, Q’s and J’s. Three 5’s
and a pair of 2’s, will beat three 4’s and a pair of aces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<h4>JACK POT LAWS.</h4>

<p><i><b>37. The Antes.</b></i> There is neither age nor straddle in jack
pots. Every one at the table must ante an equal amount. Any
player may decline to ante, by saying: “I pass this jack;” and
the dealer will give him no cards.</p>

<p><i><b>38. Opening.</b></i> After the cards are dealt, each player in turn,
beginning on the dealer’s left, may open the pot for any amount he
pleases within the betting limit, provided he holds a pair of Jacks, or
some hand better than a pair of Jacks. If he does not hold openers,
or does not wish to open the pot with them, he must say: “I pass;”
but must not abandon his hand, under penalty of paying five counters
to the pool.</p>

<p><i><b>39. False Openers.</b></i> Should a player open a jack without
the hand to justify it, and discover his error before he draws, his
hand is foul, and he forfeits whatever amount he may have already
placed in the pool. Those who have come into the pool after the
false opening, stay in and play for the pot, regardless of the value
of the hands dealt them.</p>

<p><i><b>40. Fattening.</b></i> If no player will open, the cards are reshuffled,
cut, and dealt, usually by the same dealer, and each
player adds one counter to the pool.</p>

<p><i><b>41. Coming In.</b></i> If any player opens the pot for a certain
amount, each player in turn, on his left, can come in by putting up
a similar amount, regardless of the value of his hand. Any player
on the right of the opener who passed on the first round may now
come in. Any player declining to put up the amount for which
the pot is opened must abandon his hand, and all his interest in
the pool.</p>

<p><i><b>42. Raising the Opener.</b></i> Any player coming into the
pool has the privilege of raising the original opener any amount
within the betting limit, and he may in turn be raised again, just
as in the ordinary pools. Should the opener decline to meet such
a raise, he must show his entire hand before abandoning it. If he
declines to do so, he must pay the antes for all the other players
for another jack. It is not enough to show openers before the
draw, the whole hand must be shown.</p>

<p><i><b>43. Drawing Cards.</b></i> Each player in turn who has come
in, beginning on the left of the dealer, may discard and draw, to
improve his hand. The opener is allowed to split his openers, provided
it is the rule of the game that the opener shall <i>always</i> put his
discard under the chips in the pool, whether he is going to split or
not. The opener’s discard must never be gathered in with other
discards when the pack runs short for the draw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>44. False Hands.</b></i> If a false opener does not discover his
mistake until after he has drawn cards, his hand is foul, and must
be abandoned. As a penalty he must put up an ante for each of
the other players at the table for another Jack.</p>

<p><i><b>45. Betting the Hands.</b></i> The opener makes the first bet;
or, if he has withdrawn, the player next on his left. Should the
opener decline to bet after the draw, he must show his openers
before abandoning his hand. He need not show the cards he has
drawn. If no bet is made, the last player holding cards takes the
pool without showing his hand. If a bet is made, the game proceeds
as in the ordinary pools. Should the opener retire during
the betting, he must show his openers; if he is in the final call he
must show his entire hand, whether it is the best or not. If he or
any other player declines to show his hand when a call is made,
he must ante for all the other players for another jack.</p>

<p><i><b>46. Shy Bets.</b></i> If any player is shy in a jack pot, whether
from failure to put up his ante, to fatten, or to substantiate his
mouth bets with counters, nothing can be collected from him after
a call has been made, or the pot has been won.</p>

<h3>STRAIGHT POKER.</h3>

<p>Straight Poker or <i><b>Bluff</b></i> is played with a full pack of fifty-two
cards, and any number of players from one to eight. The arrangements
for counters, seats, and deal are exactly the same as in
Draw Poker, but the method of anteing and betting up the hands
is slightly different. There is no draw to improve the hand, and
no such combination as a straight flush is recognized, four of a
kind being the highest hand possible.</p>

<p>The ante and betting limit must be decided before play begins.
The first dealer is provided with a <i><b>buck</b></i>, which should be a penknife,
or some similar article. Before dealing, he puts up the
amount of the ante for all the players, and then <i><b>passes the buck</b></i>
to the player on his left, who must ante for all the players in the
next pool. There is no variation of the amount of the ante under
any circumstances, and the buck is passed round the table in this
manner irrespective of the deal, which is taken by the player
winning the pool. The laws for the deal and its irregularities are
the same as in Draw Poker, except that it does not pass to the
left.</p>

<p>The cards dealt, each in turn, beginning with the player to the
left of the dealer, may either bet or pass. Should all pass, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
holder of the buck antes, making a double pool, and passes the
buck. The deal then passes to the left. Should any player make
a bet, each in turn, beginning with the one on his left, must call it,
raise it, or abandon his hand. Players who have passed the first
time, must now decide. The rules for seeing, raising, calling, and
showing hands are precisely the same as at Draw Poker.</p>

<p>Owing to the absence of the draw, there is no clue to the
strength of an opponent’s hand, except his manner, and the
amount of his bet. The hands shown are much weaker than the
average of those at Draw Poker, being about equal to hands that a
player in that game would come in on. Triplets are very strong
at Straight Poker, and two pairs will win three out of four pools in
a five-handed game. The great element of success is bluff.</p>

<h3>STUD POKER.</h3>

<p>The arrangements for the cards, seats, antes, buck, etc., are precisely
as at Straight Poker; but in dealing, only the first card is
dealt face down, the remaining four being turned up by the dealer
as he gives them out. Each player in turn then looks at his <i><b>down
card</b></i>, and the betting proceeds as in Straight Poker, each player
having the privilege of passing once before a bet is made.</p>

<p>A much more popular method is to stop the deal at two cards,
each player having received one face down, and another face up.
The best card showing then makes the first bet, and each player
in turn must meet it, raise it, or pass out of that pool. If no one
will call, the player making the bet takes the pool, and the next
deal. If a bet is made and called, those in the call do not show
their down cards, but are each given another card, face up, and
the same betting process is gone through, the best hand showing
face up making the first bet in each round. As long as two or
more players remain in the pool they are given more cards until
they have five. Then the final betting is done, and if a call is
made, the down cards are shown, and the best poker hand wins the
pool. Straight flushes do not count.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<h3>WHISKEY POKER.</h3>

<p>The arrangements for the cards, seats, etc., are the same as in
Draw Poker. Each player is provided with an equal number of
white counters, which may have a value attached to them, or
which may simply represent markers. If the counters represent
money, each player should have at least twenty; if they are only
markers, five is the usual number.</p>

<p>If the game is played for money, each player puts one counter
in the pool before the cards are dealt. There is no raising or betting
of any kind.</p>

<p>An extra hand, called <i><b>the widow</b></i>, is dealt face down at Whiskey
Poker. The dealer gives each player and the widow five cards,
one at a time, beginning on his left, and dealing to the widow
just before he deals to himself. Each player in turn, beginning
with the age, then examines his hand, and has the option of exchanging
it for the widow; keeping it for the purpose of drawing
to it; or risking his chances of winning the pool with it as it is.</p>

<p>If he wishes to exchange, he must place his five cards face upward
on the table, and take up the widow, but without showing it
to any other player. The hand he abandons then becomes the
widow. If he prefers to draw to his hand, he says: “<i><b>I pass</b></i>,”
which transfers to the next player the option of taking the widow.
If he wishes to stand on the merits of the hand dealt to him, without
drawing to it, he <i><b>knocks</b></i> on the table, which also passes the
option of taking the widow to the next player on his left.</p>

<p>If any player takes the widow, the next player on his left can do
any one of three things: He may discard from his own hand any
card he pleases, taking one from the widow in its stead; the card
which he discards being placed on the table face upward, and becoming
part of the widow; or he may exchange his entire hand
for the widow; or he may stand on the hand dealt him, and knock.
Whether he draws one card, exchanges his entire hand, or knocks,
the next player on his left has the option of drawing, exchanging,
or knocking; and so on, until some player does knock.</p>

<p>Should no player take the widow until it comes to the dealer’s
turn, he must either take it, or turn it face upward on the table.
Even if the dealer knocks, he must turn up the widow, and allow
each player an opportunity to draw from it, or to exchange his entire
hand for it.</p>

<p>When a player knocks, he signifies that no matter what the
players following him may do, when it comes to his turn again the
hands must be shown. A player cannot draw and knock at the
same time; but a player can refuse to draw or exchange after another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
player has knocked, not before. In some localities it is the
rule to turn the widow face up at once if any player knocks before
it is taken; allowing all those after the knock an opportunity to
draw or exchange; but this is not the usual custom.</p>

<p>Suppose five play. E deals, and A passes; B takes the widow;
C and D draw from B’s abandoned hand, and E knocks; without
drawing, of course. A, who passed the first time, now has an opportunity
to draw or exchange. So have each of the others in
turn, up to D; but after D draws or exchanges, the hands must be
shown, because the next player, E, has knocked.</p>

<p>When the hands are shown, there are two ways to settle: If
the counters have a money value, the best poker hand wins the
pool, and the deal passes to the left. If the counters have no
money value, there is no pool; but the player who has the worst
hand shown puts one of his counters in the middle of the table.
This continues until some player has lost all five of his counters,
and he is then called upon to pay for the whiskey, or whatever refreshments
may be at stake upon the game. Hence the name:
Whiskey Poker.</p>

<h3>THIRTY-ONE.</h3>

<p>This game is sometimes called <i><b>Schnautz</b></i>. A pool is made up
by any number of players. The dealer takes a pack of fifty-two
cards and gives three to each, face down, and three extra cards to
the table, dealt face up. Each player in turn to the left can exchange
one of his own cards for one of those on the table, the
object being to get a flush of three cards of some suit having a pip
value of thirty-one; or else to get three of a kind.</p>

<p>The aces are worth 11, the other court cards and the ten, 10
each. If no one can get a flush worth thirty-one, three of a kind
wins the pool. If no one has three of a kind, the highest pip value
shown in one suit wins. Drawing is kept up until some player
knocks, after which only one more draw is allowed, the knocker
not being allowed to draw again. A player can knock without
drawing at all if he wishes to prevent the others from beating his
original hand.</p>

<h3>PROGRESSIVE POKER.</h3>

<p>There are several ways to play Progressive Poker, but the
description of one will suffice. The simplest method of arranging
the players is to take two packs of cards, one red and one blue,
and to select two aces from each for the four positions at the
head table; three deuces, treys, etc., for the six positions at each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of the other tables until the last or booby table is reached, at which
there must be only four players at starting. If there are not
enough players to make exactly six at each of the intermediate
tables, the numbers may be varied from four to seven, cards
being selected to agree with the number required; but the head
and booby tables must start with four only. The cards thus
selected are then thoroughly shuffled, and presented face downward
to the ladies to draw from. Each lady takes a red-backed
card, the gentlemen drawing the blue cards only. The number
of pips on the card drawn will indicate to each person the table
at which they are to sit. Should the number of men and women
not be equal, some of the men must represent women or <i>vice
versa</i>.</p>

<p>Each player is provided at starting with a certain number of
counters, usually fifty. The head table is supplied with a box of
counters differing in colour from any of those used by the players,
and also with a bell. The choice of seats, deal, etc., is decided at
each table exactly as at Draw Poker.</p>

<p>One deal is made at each table, ordinary Draw Poker is played,
and when the pool is decided at the head table the bell is struck.
This is the signal for the winner of the pool at each of the other
tables to move up to the table next above. At the head table, the
chips are counted, and the player with the smallest number in his
possession goes down to the booby table, unless he was one of the
players in the call. Should the player with the smallest number of
chips be the winner of the pool, or one of those who called the winner,
he retains his seat, and the player with the smallest number of
counters who was not in the call goes to the booby table. This
arrangement effectually prevents players at the head table from
waiting for big hands. In case of ties, the players cut to decide
which shall go down, the lowest cut remaining. The winner of
each pool at the head table is given one of the special chips provided
for that purpose, and which are usually yellow, the others
being red, white, and blue.</p>

<p>Any player losing all his counters at any table must get a fresh
stake of fifty more from the banker, and must then exchange seats
with the player at the booby table who has the most counters.</p>

<p>Three or four prizes are usually provided for: One for the
player who has won the greatest number of yellow chips at the
head table, and one each for the lady and gentleman winning the
greatest number of counters during the evening’s play. Those
who have been provided with an extra stake must be charged with
it when settling up. In case of ties for the number of yellow
chips, the player with the largest number of ordinary counters
wins. The booby prize, if any, is usually given to the player with
the smallest number of ordinary chips, or the fewest number of
yellow ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<h3>BRAG.</h3>

<p>There are two varieties of this old English game; single, and
three-stake Brag. Both are played with a full pack of fifty-two
cards; the positions of the players, arrangements for counters, decision
of the betting limit, etc., being the same as in Draw Poker.
Three to twelve players may form a table.</p>

<p>There is a special value attached to three cards which are known
as <i><b>braggers</b></i>. These again have a rank of their own; the best
being the <i><b>ace of diamonds</b></i>; then the <i><b>Jack of clubs</b></i>, and
then the <i><b>nine of diamonds</b></i>. All other cards rank as in Poker.
A player to whom any one of these braggers is dealt may call it
anything he pleases. If he has a pair of nines and a bragger, or a
nine and two braggers, he may call them three nines, and bet on
them as such. In this respect braggers resemble mistigris, already
described in connection with Draw Poker; but in Brag a natural
pair or triplet outranks one made with the aid of a bragger. Three
eights will beat an eight and two braggers.</p>

<p>The dealer must put up an ante before the cards are cut. This
ante may be any amount he pleases within the betting limit. No
player can straddle or raise this ante until the cards are dealt. Beginning
on his left the dealer distributes the cards face down, and
one at a time, until each player has received three. Beginning
with the age, [eldest hand,] each player in turn must put up an
amount equal to the dealer’s ante, or abandon his hand. He may,
if he chooses, raise the ante any further amount within the betting
limit. All those following him must meet the total sum put up by
any individual player, increase it, or pass out. In this respect Brag
is precisely similar to the betting after the draw at Poker.</p>

<p>If no one will see the dealer’s ante, he must be paid one white
counter by each of the other players, and the deal passes to the
left. Should any player bet an amount which no other player will
meet, he takes the pool without showing his hand. Should a call
be made, all the hands must be shown, and the best brag hand
wins.</p>

<p>Pairs and triplets are the only combinations of any value, and of
course three aces is the best hand; two aces and the club Jack being
the next best. If none of the hands shown contains either a
natural pair or a bragger, the highest card wins, the ace ranking
above the King. In case of equal natural pairs, the highest card
outside the pair wins. Should the pairs tied both be made with a
bragger, the highest bragger wins. Two odd cards, seven high,
with the club Jack, would beat two cards seven high with the diamond
nine.</p>

<p><i><b>Three Stake Brag.</b></i> In this variation each player puts up
three equal amounts to form three equal pools. These amounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
must be invariable, and should be agreed upon before play begins.
The dealer then gives two cards to each player, one at a
time, face down; and then a third card to each, face up. The
highest card turned up in this manner wins one of the pools, the
ace being the highest and the deuce the lowest. The diamond
ace, being a bragger, outranks any other ace; the club Jack any
other Jack; and the diamond nine any other nine. Ties are decided
in favour of the eldest hand, or the player nearest him on
the left.</p>

<p>The players then take up the other two cards, without showing
them, and proceed to brag on their hands as in single stake Brag.
The winner takes the second pool; but those who pass out do not
abandon their hands until the third pool is decided. If no bet is
made for the second pool, it is won by the dealer.</p>

<p>All hands are shown to decide the last pool. Each player
counts up the pip value of his three cards, reckoning the aces
for eleven, and court-cards as ten each. The player coming nearest
to thirty-one takes the third pool. Ties are decided in favour
of the eldest hand, as before.</p>

<p>In some places a further variation is introduced by allowing the
players to draw cards for the third pool, in order to increase the pip
value of their hands. Beginning with the eldest hand, each player
in turn pays into the pool a counter for each card he draws. These
cards are given by the dealer face up, and one player must be
given all he needs before passing to the next. Should a player
pass thirty-one, he is out of the pool. Some judgment is necessary
in drawing in this manner, for all the hands are exposed, and each
player knows exactly what he has to beat.</p>

<p>In <i><b>American Brag</b></i>, there are eight braggers; the Jacks and
nines of each suit, and they are all of equal rank when used as
braggers. Pairs or triplets formed with the aid of braggers outrank
naturals, so that three Jacks is an invincible hand, beating
three aces. Two braggers and an ace outrank two aces and a bragger;
but the absurd part of the arrangement is that three Jacks
and three nines are a tie.</p>

<p>The method of playing differs from English Brag. If the
players simply equal the dealer’s ante, nothing unusual occurs,
and all the hands are shown at once. But if any player raises, and
another sees this raise, these two immediately exchange hands,
without showing them to the other players, and the one who held
the worse hand retires from that pool, returning the better hand
to its original holder, who then awaits a call or raise from the next
player in order, the entire amount staked still remaining in the
pool. This lose-and-drop-out system is continued until only one
player remains to dispute the pool with the dealer. If they come
to a call, both hands are shown to the table. If the bragger is not
called, he takes the pool without showing his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<h3>COMMERCE.</h3>

<p>This old English game is evidently the forerunner of Whiskey
Poker. It is played with a full pack of fifty-two cards, and the
arrangements for the seats, counters, etc., are the same as at Draw
Poker. Three to twelve players may form a table. There are
two methods of playing Commerce; with and without a widow.
We shall take the older form first.</p>

<p><i><b>Without a Widow.</b></i> The counters have a money value, and
each player deposits one in the pool. The dealer then distributes
the cards one at a time, face down, until each has three. The
players then examine their cards, and each in turn, beginning with
the eldest hand, may exchange one card. If he trades <i><b>for ready
money</b></i>, he gives his card and one white counter to the dealer,
and receives another card, face down, from the top of the pack.
The discard is left on the table, and the counter is the dealer’s perquisite.
If he trades <i><b>for barter</b></i>, he passes his discard to the
player on his left, who must give one of his own in exchange before
looking at the one he is to receive. If the player will not
exchange, he must <i><b>knock</b></i> on the table, to signify that he will
stand by the cards he has. If he exchanges, he takes up the
offered card, and then has the privilege of trading for ready money
or for barter himself. The trading goes on in this way round and
round, until some player knocks, when all trading is immediately
stopped, and the hands are shown. The best hand wins the pool,
the rank of the various combinations being as follows, beginning
with the highest:&mdash;</p>

<p><i><b>Triplets.</b></i> Three aces being the highest, and three deuces the
lowest. Pairs have no value.</p>

<p><i><b>Sequence Flushes</b></i>; the ace being allowed to rank as the top
or the bottom; Q K A, or A 2 3.</p>

<p><i><b>The Point</b></i>; the greatest number of pips on two or three cards
of the same suit in one hand, counting the ace for eleven, and the
other court-cards for ten each. A single card of a suit does not
count for the point. In case of ties, a point made with three cards
will beat one made with two cards. If the number of cards is also
a tie, the dealer, or the player nearest him on his left wins.</p>

<p>If no triplet is shown, the best straight flush wins. If there is
no straight flush, the best point wins. The deal passes to the
left, and a misdeal loses the deal, as the deal is an advantage,
owing to the trade for ready money.</p>

<p>If the dealer does not win the pool, he must pay one white
counter to the player who does. If the dealer holds a combination
of the same rank as the one that wins the pool, he must pay one
white counter to every other player at the table. For instance:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
No triplet is shown, and a straight flush, Jack high, wins the pool.
The dealer has a straight flush, 9 high, and must pay one counter
to every player at the table. If the dealer had no sequence flush,
he would pay the winner of the pool only.</p>

<p><i><b>With a Widow.</b></i> This is almost three-card Whiskey Poker.
Each player is provided with three counters only, which are of no
value, and three cards are dealt to each player and to the widow,
face down, and one at a time. The widow is turned face up immediately,
and the dealer has the first say. Before he looks at the
cards he has dealt to himself, he may exchange his whole hand
for the widow, otherwise the eldest hand has the first draw. No
other player may exchange his whole hand, but each in turn may
draw one card until some player knocks. The moment any player
knocks, all drawing must cease, and the hands are shown at once.
Triplets, straight flushes, and points determine the value of the
hands, as already described, and the best hand takes the pool.
The dealer makes no extra payments, as he has no perquisites.
The first player to lose his three counters pays for the whiskey;
and if two or more are frozen out at the same time, the one with
the worst hand pays. The game is sometimes varied by playing
freeze-out, a value being attached to the three counters, and players
who are decavé retiring from the game until all the counters
have been won by a single player.</p>

<p>Two other combinations are sometimes introduced in either
form of Commerce: A flush, three cards of one suit, ranking next
below the straight flush; and a single pair outranking the point.</p>

<p>Another variety of Commerce is variously known as <i><b>My Ship
Sails; or My Bird Sings</b></i>. The counters have a money value,
and three are given to each player. Three cards are dealt, face
down, and one at a time. There is no widow. The eldest hand may
then exchange one card with the player on his left, who must give
his card before seeing the one he is to receive. The exchange
goes round to the left. The moment any player finds himself with
a flush, three cards of the same suit, regardless of their value,
whether dealt to him, or made by exchange, he says: “My Ship
Sails;” and all exchange is stopped, and the hands are shown.
Should there be more than one flush, the pips win, counting ace
for 11, and other court-cards for 10 each. If no player has secured
a flush after two rounds of exchanges, the hands are shown,
and the highest number of pips in the two-card flushes wins the
pool. The elder hand wins ties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<h3>BOUILLOTTE, OR BRELAN.</h3>

<p>This is an old and famous French gambling game, often referred
to in stories of fast life in European society. It was the
rage during and long after the French Revolution, but has lately
had to share public attention with Baccara, and even with Le Poker
Américain. It has many points in common with three-stake Brag,
and is evidently descended from the same stock. By many persons
Bouillotte is considered superior to Poker, because it offers the
player many opportunities to speculate on winning by the aid of
cards that are not in his own hand.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards.</b></i> Bouillotte is played with a piquet pack, reduced to
twenty cards, only the A K Q 9 8 of each suit being retained.
The ace is the highest card in play and in cutting. If five persons
play, the Jack of each suit is added; if only three play, the Queens
are discarded, reducing the pack to sixteen cards. Two packs are
generally used alternately.</p>

<p><i><b>Counters</b></i> or chips are used, as in Poker, instead of money.
Any player may be the banker.</p>

<p><i><b>Players.</b></i> Three, four, or five persons may play; but four is the
proper number, and all descriptions of the game suppose it to be
four-handed.</p>

<p><i><b>Cutting.</b></i> To decide the positions of the players, a sequence of
cards is sorted out, equal in number with the number of players.
These cards are then shuffled, face downward, and each player
draws one. The highest of the sequence has the choice of positions,
and so on down until all are seated. The player who draws
the King deals the first hand.</p>

<p><i><b>Stakes.</b></i> Each player purchases an equal number of counters
from the banker, usually 100. This original <i><b>cave</b></i> cannot be
added to or deducted from. As long as a single counter of it remains
the player must call for a sight, just as in freeze-out or
table stakes; and not until he is <i><b>decavé</b></i>, [has lost everything,]
can he purchase another stake, the amount of which is usually
at his own option.</p>

<p><i><b>Blind and Straddle.</b></i> Before the distribution of the cards,
the dealer puts up a blind, usually five counters, which the player
on his right has the privilege of straddling. If he straddles, he
may be straddled again, and so on. In Bouillotte the straddle
practically buys from the dealer the privileges of the age. If it
goes round until the dealer buys it back himself, the straddling
must then be stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> As in all French games, the cards are cut by the
player on the dealer’s left, and are dealt from right to left. Three
cards are given to each player, one at a time, face down, and the
thirteenth is then turned face up on the pack. This card is called
the <i><b>retourne</b></i>.</p>

<p><i><b>Misdeals.</b></i> If any card is exposed during the deal, either in
the pack or in giving it to a player, it is a misdeal; but the distribution
of the cards is continued until each player has received
three cards, the exposed card being given out in its regular order.
If any player can show triplets, he receives one white counter from
each of the other players, and the hands are then abandoned. If
more than one triplet is shown, the inferior does not pay the
higher. If no triplet is shown, the cards are redealt. A misdeal
does not lose the deal.</p>

<p>The deal passes to the right; but should the player whose turn
it is to deal have lost everything on the previous deal, and have
just purchased another stake, the deal passes to the player beyond
him. If a player withdraws from the table when it is his turn to
deal, the deal passes any newcomer who may take his place.</p>

<p><i><b>Betting.</b></i> The cards dealt, each player in turn, beginning with
the one to the right of the dealer, or to the right of the last straddler,
if any, can do one of three things: Equal the amount of the
ante; increase it as much as he pleases within the limits of his
cave; or pass, retaining his cards but betting nothing. If any
player <i><b>opens</b></i> the game by making a bet, the player on his right
may equal or raise it; but he cannot pass after the game is opened,
unless he withdraws from the pool. Any player may call for a
sight for the amount in front of him, but that does not prevent the
others from continuing the betting. If no one will open, the deal
is void, and each player puts five counters in the pool for the next
deal. If a player opens, and no one will equal or raise him, he
wins the antes and straddles, if any. If any player makes a raise
which no one will meet, he takes whatever is in the pool, unless a
player has called for a sight for a small part of it.</p>

<p><i><b>Calling and Showing.</b></i> If only two players bet against each
other, either may call the other, and demand a show of hands at
any time; but if three or four are betting, the privilege of calling
falls upon each in turn from right to left. For instance: A, B, C,
and D play. D blinds five counters, and deals. A passes, and B
opens for five reds. C passes out, while D and A both meet the
bet of five reds, but neither will raise it. This does not call B,
who has the privilege of raising the bet if he pleases. Suppose he
raises, and D and A both meet it. On this second round, C having
passed out, it is D’s turn to say whether or not he will raise.
On the next round it will be A’s turn, and after that it will be B’s
second turn, and so on. Should any player meet the bet but refuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
to raise, although it is his turn, he still cannot call. If he
does not avail himself of his privilege of raising, he must <i><b>pass
the word</b></i> to the player on his right; that is, transfer the privilege
to him. If he declines, it is a call; if he raises, it goes on until
every player has refused to avail himself of the privilege. If a
player chooses to raise without waiting for his turn, of course he
can do so. One of the fine points in the game is knowing when
to raise the bet yourself, and when to pass the word.</p>

<p><i><b>Rank of the Hands.</b></i> If a call is made, the hands are shown,
and the best Bouillotte hand wins. There are only two classes of
hands recognized in Bouillotte, the brelan, and the point; but
there are three kinds of brelans, which rank in the following order:</p>

<p><i><b>A Brelan Carré</b></i> is four of a kind; three in the player’s hand,
and the fourth turned up on the pack. If any player holds a brelan,
[three of a kind,] of a higher denomination than the brelan
carré, the player may turn up the card under the retourne, and if
this makes his hand a brelan carré also, he wins the pool. In addition
to winning the pool, the holder of a brelan carré receives
from each player four white counters.</p>

<p><i><b>A Simple Brelan</b></i> is three of a kind in the player’s hand,
three aces being the highest, and three eights the lowest. In addition
to winning the pool, the holder of a simple brelan receives
one counter from each of the other players at the table. If two
are shown, neither pays the other. Should the brelan be formed
by uniting the retourne with two cards in the player’s hand, it is
a <i><b>brelan favori</b></i>, and the holder of it receives an extra counter
from every player at the table, whether he wins the pool or not.
For instance: The retourne is an eight; a brelan of Queens is
shown, and wins the pool. Another player holds a pair of eights,
and claims brelan favori. He does not pay the winning brelan,
but receives one counter from its holder, and also from each of the
other players. If the brelan favori wins the pool, it is paid two
counters by each player. If two simple brelans are shown, the
higher wins the pool; but both must be paid by each of the other
two players, who did not hold brelans.</p>

<p><i><b>The Point.</b></i> If no brelan is shown, the hands of all the players
are shown, including those who passed out during the betting.
This will expose thirteen cards, including the retourne. The pips
in each suit are then counted, the ace reckoning for 11, court cards
for 10 each, and the 9 and 8 at their face value. Whichever suit
has the greatest number of pips is called <i><b>the suit that wins</b></i>,
and the player who holds the highest card of it takes the pool;
provided, of course, that he was one of those who backed his hand
until the last call. If the player who holds the best card of the
winning suit has dropped out during the betting, his cards count
for the player who has the highest card of the suit among those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
who backed their hands. For instance: D deals and turns the
heart 8. A and B have passed out, but C has made a bet which
D has called. Neither has a brelan, so all four players show their
cards, and it is found that they lie thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p257a.jpg" width="500" height="225" alt="Layout of the cards" />
</div>

<p>Spades are the winning suit: but neither C nor D has a spade,
and as neither A nor B is in the call, the spade suit cannot win
anything. As between clubs and hearts, D’s point is 40, and C’s
38; so D wins the pool. C of course had a great advantage in
betting, as he knew four hearts were out, his own and the retourne;
and all he feared was a brelan. A would have won the pool if he
had backed his hand, because he would have had the highest card
of the winning suit.</p>

<p><i><b>Calling for a Sight.</b></i> Suppose four players have the following
caves in front of them: A, 35; B, 60; C, 120; and D,
185. D blinds five, deals, and turns the heart 9. A puts up all
his 35 counters. B passes out. C raises 50, putting up 85; and
D bets everything, 180 more than his blind. A demands a sight
for his 35, and C puts up the remainder of his 120, and calls a sight
for them. Then D withdraws his superfluous 65, and it is a call.
No one has a brelan, so all the hands are shown, and the cards lie
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p257b.jpg" width="500" height="225" alt="Layout of the cards" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>The point is exactly even for clubs and spades, 40 in each. In
case of ties, the dealer, or the player nearest him on the right wins.
In this case A wins on account of his position, so clubs is the winning
suit, and A has the best card of it. But he can win from
C and D only the amount for which he called a sight, <i>i.e.</i> 35
counters. He therefore takes down 105 as his share of the pool,
leaving 170 to be decided between C and D. Now, although C
has a better point than D, it is one of the principles of the game
that the suit that wins cannot lose at the same time; and as D has
a card of the winning suit, while C has not, D wins the remainder
of the pool. If neither C nor D had a card of the winning suit, C
would win from D on account of his better point.</p>

<p>If we transposed the club ace and spade ace, spades would be
the winning suit, because the elder hand, A, had the best card of
it; but C would take the remainder of the pool, because he held a
spade, while D did not.</p>

<p>As it is, C is decavé, and must purchase another stake, or retire
from the game. If C had lost this pool with a brelan in his
hand, he would not be decavé; because after losing the pool, and
all he had staked therein, B, who had passed out, would have to
pay him for the brelan, and with this one white counter he would
have to call for a sight in the next pool he entered.</p>

<p><i><b>Methods of Cheating.</b></i> As in all games in which winning
depends entirely on the cards held, and not on the manner of playing
them, Bouillotte offers many opportunities to the greek. The
small number of cards in the pack, and the consequent ease with
which they may be handled, enable even the clumsiest card sharpers
to run up brelan carrés, make false shuffles, and shift cuts.
There is one trick, called the poussette, which consists in surreptitiously
placing more counters on the table when the player
finds he has a hand worth backing. Marked cards, and packs
trimmed to taper one way, biseautés, are among the most common
weapons of the French tricheurs. As in Poker, it is best to avoid
playing with strangers.</p>

<p><i><b>Suggestions for Good Play.</b></i> Beyond the usual qualifications
necessary to succeed with any member of the poker family,
Bouillotte requires some study of the probable value of the point,
which value will vary with the number of players engaged in the
coup. For instance: The first player to say, having only 21 in his
hand, should ante; but if two other players had already anted, 31,
or even 40 would be a doubtful hand. If a bet had been made
and met by another player, such a point should generally be laid
down.</p>

<p>With good cards it is always better for the eldest hand to pass,
especially with a brelan, for he will then have an opportunity to
judge of the value of the hands against him, and he can raise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
bet to his advantage. Good players will not bet on an ace alone,
unless the suit is turned up; nor on a point of 21 with a weak
card of the turn-up suit. If three play in a pool the point should
be very strong to follow beyond the first raise; and if four players
are engaged, it is almost a certainty that brelans will be shown.</p>

<p>When a player with a brelan has frightened off his opponents
with a big bet, it is usual to <i><b>stifle</b></i> the brelan, as it is considered
more to the player’s advantage to leave his adversaries under the
impression that he may have been bluffing than to show the hand
for the sake of the one white counter to which it entitles him.
With three cards of one suit to the King, it is usual to bet high,
in order to drive out anything but a brelan. Any player holding
ace and another of the suit will of course abandon his hand,
as his point is worth only 21 at the most, and the player with
three to the King will get the benefit of his cards when the point
is counted.</p>

<h3>AMBIGU.</h3>

<p><i><b>Cards.</b></i> Ambigu is played with a pack of forty cards, the K
Q J of each suit being deleted. The cards rank in the order of
their numerical value, the 10 being the highest, and the ace the
lowest. Two packs may be used alternately.</p>

<p><i><b>Players.</b></i> Any number from two to six may form the table,
and the arrangements for seats, first deal, etc., should be decided
as at Bouillotte.</p>

<p><i><b>Stakes.</b></i> Each player begins with an equal number of counters,
the value of which must be determined beforehand. A betting
limit should be agreed upon, and one player should be the banker
for the evening.</p>

<p><i><b>Blind.</b></i> Before the cards are dealt, each player deposits one
counter in the pool; there is no straddle.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> The cards are cut to the left, and dealt to the
right, and two cards are given to each player, one at a time, face
down.</p>

<p><i><b>Method of Playing.</b></i> Each player in turn, beginning on the
dealer’s right, examines his hand, and if satisfied with it he says:
“Enough.” If not satisfied, he may discard one or both of his
cards, and receive others from the top of the pack. In either case
he places two white counters in the pool for his ante. All having
decided to stand or to draw, the remainder of the pack, exclusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
of the discards, is reshuffled and cut; each player is then given
two more cards, one at a time, and face down. Each in turn examines
his four cards, and if satisfied he says: “I play;” if not,
he says: “I pass.” If all pass, the dealer has the choice of two
things: He may gather the cards and deal again, each player
putting another counter into the pool, or he may put up two white
counters himself, and compel the players to retain the cards dealt
them, the dealer keeping his also.</p>

<p>Any person announcing to play may put up as many counters as
he pleases within the betting limit. If no person will stay with
him, he takes back his raise, leaving the antes, and is paid two
counters by the last player who refuses. If two or more declare
to play they can either meet the amount offered by the first player,
or raise him. If any player declines to meet a raise, he must
abandon his hand. If no one will call the last raise, the player
making it takes the pool, and then shows his hand, and demands
payment from each of the other players for whatever combination
he holds. If two or more players call, by making their bets equal,
they again draw cards, having the privilege of discarding any
number from one to four, or of standing pat. After the draw
each in turn can pass or play. If all pass, the hands are abandoned,
and the pool remains; each player adding one counter for
the next deal. This is to force players to bet on their hands.
If a bet is made, the calling and raising proceeds as in Draw
Poker.</p>

<p>When there are not enough cards to supply the players, the
discards must be gathered, shuffled, and cut. Any player with
too many or too few cards must abandon his hand as foul. Any
player showing his cards must abandon his hand, and forfeit four
counters to the pool.</p>

<p>The general laws of Poker governing all irregularities may be
applied to Ambigu; but it must be remembered that the French
are very much averse to penalties of all kinds, and if an error can
be rectified without doing an injustice to any player, it is usual to
set things right in the simplest manner possible.</p>

<p><i><b>Value of the Hands.</b></i> There are seven combinations of
value in Ambigu, which rank in the following order, beginning
with the lowest:&mdash;</p>

<p><i><b>The Point.</b></i> The total number of pips on two or more cards
of the same suit. A single card does not count for the point.
Three cards of one suit are a better point than two cards, even if
there are more pips on the two cards. If no higher combination
than a point is shown, the player with the winning point receives
<i><b>one counter</b></i> from each of the other players at the table, besides
winning the pool, and everything in it. In case of ties, the player
having two cards in sequence wins. For instance: an 8 and a 7<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
will beat a 10 and a 5. If this does not decide it, the elder hand
wins.</p>

<p><i><b>The Prime.</b></i> Four cards of different suits, sometimes called
a Dutch flush, is a better hand than the point. If a prime is the
best combination shown, the holder wins the pool, and receives
<i><b>two counters</b></i> from each of the other players. If the pips in the
prime aggregate more than thirty, it is called <i><b>Grand Prime</b></i>,
and the holder receives <i><b>three counters</b></i> from each of the other
players, instead of two. If two or more primes are shown, the
one with the highest number of pips wins. If this is still a tie,
the elder hand wins.</p>

<p><i><b>A Sequence</b></i> is a bobtail straight flush; that is, three of the
four cards are in sequence, such as the 2, 3 and 4 of spades,
with an odd card, such as a 9. This is a better combination than
a prime, and the holder receives <i><b>three counters</b></i> from each
player. In case of ties, the highest sequence wins. If the sequence
flush is one of four cards, it is a doublet.</p>

<p><i><b>A Tricon</b></i>, or three of a kind, is better than a straight, and
entitles the holder to <i><b>four counters</b></i> from each of the other
players. Pairs have no value.</p>

<p><i><b>A Flush</b></i> is four cards of the same suit, not necessarily in sequence,
and is better than a tricon. The holder is paid <i><b>five
counters</b></i> by each of the other players, in addition to winning the
pool.</p>

<p><i><b>Doublets.</b></i> Any hand containing a double combination will
beat any single combination. For instance: A player holds
three of a kind, and the fourth card in his hand is of a different
suit from any of his triplet. His hand is a double combination,
prime and tricon, and will beat a flush. A sequence of four
cards of the same suit is a double combination, and will beat anything
but a fredon. When doublets are shown, the holder is paid
for both combinations, <i><b>six</b></i> for tricon and prime, or <i><b>eight</b></i> for
sequence and flush, as the case may be.</p>

<p><i><b>A Fredon</b></i>, or four of a kind, is the best possible hand, and
the holder is paid <i><b>ten or eleven counters</b></i> by each of the other
players, according to the pip value of his cards. He is paid eight
counters for fredon, and two for the prime, if it is smaller than 8’s;
but he claims grand prime if he has four 9’s, or four 10’S, and gets
eleven counters.</p>

<p>In case of <i><b>ties</b></i> which cannot be decided by the pip values, the
elder hand wins.</p>

<p>Even if a player has lost his entire stake in the pool, he must
pay the various combinations shown, and it is usual to reserve
about ten counters for this purpose.</p>

<p><i><b>Betting the Hands.</b></i> After the last cards have been drawn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the players proceed to bet upon their hands precisely as at Poker.
If a player makes a bet or raise which no one will call, he takes
the pool, and then shows his hand and demands payment for the
combination he holds. It is very unusual for a player to stifle a
hand at Ambigu, as he would at Bouillotte. If a call is made,
the players in the call show and compare their cards, and the best
hand wins the pool. Only the player who wins the pool can demand
payment for combinations held.</p>

<h2 id="THE_EUCHRE_FAMILY">THE EUCHRE FAMILY.</h2>

<p>This family embraces four of the best known and most popular
games in the world, each of which has been considered the
national game in its own country: Écarté in France; Napoleon in
England; Spoil Five in Ireland; and Euchre in America.</p>

<p>It has always been the custom to trace the origin of Euchre to
a variety of Triomphe, or French Ruff, probably introduced to
America by the French of Louisiana; and to claim Écarté as its
cousin, and the French survivor of the parent game. In the
opinion of the author, both the game and its name go to show
that Euchre is of mixed stock, and probably originated in an attempt
to play the ancient Irish game of Spoil Five with a piquet
pack. “Euchre” is not a French word, but the meaning of it is
identical with “Spoil Five”; both names signifying that the object
of the game is to prevent the maker of the trump from getting
three tricks. In the one game he is “spoiled;” in the other he is
“euchred.” In the old game of Triomphe, in Écarté, and in the
black suits in Spoil Five, the order of the court cards in plain suits
is the same, the ace ranking below the Jack. But in Euchre the
Jack ranks above the ace when the suit is trumps, exactly as it
does in Spoil Five. In the latter game the five is the best trump;
but as there is no five in a piquet pack, that trump was probably
disregarded, leaving the Jack the best. Taking up, or “robbing”
the turn-up trump, is another trait common to both Spoil Five
and Euchre.</p>

<p>Spoil Five and Triomphe are mentioned in the earliest works on
card games. Triomphe can be traced to 1520, when it was popular
in Spain; and the origin of Maw, the parent of Spoil Five, is
lost in the mists of Irish antiquity. It was the fashionable game
during the reign of James I.</p>

<p>The old Spanish game of Triomphe, now obsolete, seems to
have undergone several changes after its introduction to France.
At first it was played either by two persons, or by two pairs of
partners. If one side had bad cards, they could offer to abandon
the hand, and allow the adversaries to count a point without playing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
If the adversaries refused, they were obliged to win all five
tricks or lose two points. It was compulsory to win the trick if
possible, and to trump, over-trump, or under-trump if the player had
none of the suit led. This peculiarity survives in the games of
Rams and Loo, which also belong to the euchre family.</p>

<p>After a time we find a variation introduced in which any number
from two to six could play, each for himself, and the player first
winning two tricks out of the five marked the point. Later still
we find the ace ranking above the King, thus becoming the best
trump. If the ace was turned up, the dealer had the privilege of
robbing it, or the holder of the ace of trumps could rob the turn-up,
discarding any card he pleased, just as in Spoil Five. But in
Triomphe the dealer turned up another card, and if that was of
the trump suit the holder of the ace could rob that also, and so on
until he turned a card of a different suit. This did not alter the
trump, but merely stopped the robbing process. Whether or not
Triomphe borrowed this feature from Spoil Five or Maw, it is now
impossible to say.</p>

<p>Whatever its origin, Euchre has always been the most respectable
member of the family, and the game of all others that has best
served the card-playing interest in social life. Spoil Five probably
comes next in point of respectability; but Écarté has often fallen
into evil hands, and the very name is in some places regarded as
synonymous for gambling. The same is true of Napoleon, but in
less degree. Euchre, unlike the other members of the family, is
not essentially a gambling game, but belongs rather to the intellectual
group of card games; a position which we hope it may long
maintain.</p>

<h3>EUCHRE.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Euchre is played with what is commonly known as
the piquet pack, 32 cards, all below the 7 being deleted. In plain
suits the cards rank as at Whist; but in the trump suit the Jack
is the best, and it is called the <i><b>Right Bower</b></i>. The Jack of the
same colour as the trump suit, red or black, is the second-best
trump, and it is called the <i><b>Left Bower</b></i>; so that if clubs were
trumps the rank of the nine cards in the trump suit would be as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/p264.jpg" width="450" height="75" alt="🃛 🂫 🃑 🃞 🃝 🃚 🃙 🃘 🃗" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>The rank of the cards in the other suits would be:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<img src="images/p265a.jpg" width="430" height="225" alt="🂡 🂮 🂭 🂪 🂩 🂨 🂧 | 🂱 🂾 🂽 🂻 🂺 🂹 🂸 🂷 | 🃁 🃎 🃍 🃋 🃊 🃉 🃈 🃇" />
</div>

<p>When the <i><b>Joker</b></i>, or blank card is used, it is always the best
trump, ranking above the right bower. In cutting, the ace is low,
the other cards ranking as in plain suits. A player cutting the
Joker must cut again.</p>

<p><i><b>COUNTERS</b></i> or whist markers may be used for keeping the
score, but it is much more common to use the small cards from the
deleted portion of the pack. The game is five points, and the best
method of scoring is to use the 4 and 3 of any suit. When the 3
is face up, but covered by the 4 face down, it counts <i><b>one</b></i>. When
the 4 is face up, covered by the 3 face down, it counts <i><b>two</b></i>.
When the 4 is face down, covered by the 3 face up, it counts
<i><b>three</b></i>. When the 3 is face down, covered by the 4 face up, it
counts <i><b>four</b></i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p265b.jpg" width="400" height="100" alt="[🃓 covered by facedown card] [🃔 covered by facedown card] [🃓 covering a facedown card] [🃔 covering a facedown card]" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap spacer">One.</span> <span class="smcap spacer">Two.</span> <span class="smcap spacer">Three.</span> <span class="smcap">Four.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The number of pips exposed on the card which is face up is immaterial;
the relative position of the two cards will always determine
the score.</p>

<p>Rubber or game scores must be kept on a whist marker, or on a
sheet of paper.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Euchre may be played by any number of persons
from two to seven; but in the seven-handed game the full
pack of fifty-three cards is used. Whatever the number of players,
they cut for positions at the table, for partners, and for the
deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> The cards are usually spread, face down, and
each candidate for play draws a card.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/p266.jpg" width="250" height="75" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Spreading the Pack.</span></p>
</div>

<p>When <i><b>two</b></i> or <i><b>three</b></i> play, the lowest cut has the choice of seats,
and takes the first deal. When <i><b>four</b></i> play, they cut for partners;
the two highest pairing against the two lowest. The lowest has
the choice of seats, and deals the first hand. When <i><b>five</b></i> or
<i><b>seven</b></i> play, they have the choice of seats in their order, the lowest
first, and the lowest cut deals. When <i><b>six</b></i> play, the three lowest
are partners against the three highest, the lowest cut having the
choice of seats, and the first deal.</p>

<p><i><b>TIES.</b></i> Players cutting cards of equal value cut again; but the
new cut decides nothing but the tie.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYER’S POSITIONS.</b></i> The <i><b>eldest hand</b></i>, or age, sits
on the left of the dealer, and the <i><b>pone</b></i> sits on the dealer’s right.
There are no distinctive names for the other positions.</p>

<p>When <i><b>two</b></i> play, they sit opposite each other. When <i><b>three</b></i>
play, each for himself, the game is known as <i><b>Cut Throat</b></i>, and
the position of the players is immaterial. When <i><b>four</b></i> play, the
partners sit opposite each other. When <i><b>five</b></i> or <i><b>seven</b></i> play, the
maker of the trump in each deal selects his partners, and they play
against the others without any change in their positions at the
table. When <i><b>six</b></i> play, three are partners against the other three,
and the opposing players sit alternately round the table.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> If there is any stake upon the game, its amount
must be settled before play begins. When <i><b>rubbers</b></i> are played,
it is usual to make the stake so much a rubber point. If the winners
of the game are five points to their adversaries’ nothing, they
win a <i><b>treble</b></i>, and count three rubber points. If the losers have
scored one or two points only, the winners mark two points for a
<i><b>double</b></i>. If the losers have reached three or four, the winners
mark one for a <i><b>single</b></i>. The side winning the rubber adds two
points to its score for so doing; so that the largest rubber possible
is one of eight points;&mdash;two triples to nothing, and two added for
the rubber. The smallest possible is one point;&mdash;two singles
and the rubber, against a triple. If the first two games are won by
the same partners, the third is not played.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> Any player has the right to shuffle the cards,
the dealer last. The pack must be presented to the pone to be
cut, and he must leave at least four cards in each packet. Beginning
on his left, the dealer distributes the cards either two at a
time and then three, or three and then two to each player in rotation,
until all have five cards. Whichever number, two or three,
the dealer begins with, he must continue giving the same number
to every player, including himself, for the first round. After the
cards are dealt, the next card is turned face up on the remainder
of the pack, except in five and seven-handed Euchre, in which no
trump is turned. Each player deals in turn to the left, until the
conclusion of the game or rubber.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in the Deal.</b></i> If any card is found faced
in the pack, the dealer must deal again. Should the dealer expose
any card but the trump while dealing, the adversaries may
demand a new deal by the same dealer. Should any adversary of
the dealer expose a card, the dealer may elect to deal again. A
player dealing out of turn may be stopped before the trump card
is turned; but after that the deal must stand, afterward passing
to the left in regular order. On the completion of the deal, if any
player has more or less than five cards, it is a misdeal, and the
deal passes to the player on the misdealer’s left.</p>

<p>The dealer loses his deal if he neglects to have the pack cut; if
he deals a card incorrectly, and fails to remedy the error before
dealing another; if he counts the cards on the table, or those remaining
in the pack; or if he deals two cards to one player and
three to another in the same round.</p>

<p>If the pack is found to be imperfect, the deal in which the error
is discovered is void; but all previous scores stand good.</p>

<p><i><b>MAKING THE TRUMP.</b></i> Although a card is turned
up at the end of the deal, the suit to which it belongs is not necessarily
the trump for that hand. Each player in turn, beginning on
the dealer’s left, whether he be an adversary or a partner of the
dealer’s, may insist on the turn-up suit remaining the trump; or
he may declare that he is indifferent as to which suit is the trump,
the one turned up or some other. But should one player in his
proper turn decide in favour of the turn-up, no player after him
can alter the decision. When it comes to the dealer’s turn, if no
other player has decided to retain the suit turned up, he must
either let the trump remain as it is, or insist on its being changed.</p>

<p>As the individual or side that settles which suit shall be the
trump is said to <i><b>make the trump</b></i>, it will be necessary to describe
the method of scoring in order to understand the principles
that guide the players in deciding on the trump suit.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> Euchre is played for tricks. If the side that
makes the trump takes three or four tricks out of the five possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
it scores one point. If the side wins all five tricks, it scores two
points for a <i><b>march</b></i>. If the player that makes the trump fails to
win three tricks, he is <i><b>euchred</b></i>, and his adversaries score two
points for the euchre. <i><b>When four play</b></i>, if the player who
makes the trump declares to play <i><b>alone</b></i>, that is, without any
assistance from his partner, who must lay down his cards, the
maker of the trump scores four points if he succeeds in winning
all five tricks, and one point if he wins three or four tricks. But
if he fails to win three tricks, he is euchred, and the adversaries
score two points. <i><b>When three play</b></i>, a lone hand counts three
if the player wins all five tricks. <i><b>When two play</b></i>, five tricks is
simply a march, and counts two points. <i><b>When five or seven
play</b></i>, there are special scores for lone hands. When all five
tricks are taken by one side, but not by an individual playing a
lone hand, it is simply a march, and counts two points, no matter
how many are playing. When two or three are playing, a march
must of course be a lone hand, as there are no partnerships. As
we shall see later, there are some varieties of Euchre in which a
lone hand may play against a lone hand, but this is not permitted
in the ordinary game.</p>

<p>No one but the individual player who makes the trump can play
alone.</p>

<p>Except in five and seven-handed Euchre, the player or side
first reaching five points wins the game. If three are playing, and
two of them reach five points simultaneously by euchreing the
third, they both win a game. If they are playing for stakes, they
divide the pool.</p>

<p><i><b>TAKING UP THE TRUMP.</b></i> After the trump is turned
up, each player in turn examines his cards, and if he does not care
whether the trump suit remains unchanged or not, he says: “<i><b>I
pass</b></i>.” If all pass, the dealer must decide. The dealer has the
advantage of being allowed to take the trump card into his own
hand, discarding one of his worthless cards in its place. If he
thinks he can make three tricks with the turn-up suit for trumps,
and his partner’s probable assistance, or can win five tricks by
playing alone, he discards any card he pleases, placing it under
the remainder of the pack, face down, and without showing or
naming it. If the dealer decides to play alone, it is usual for him
to pass his discard across the table to his partner, face down, so
that there may be no misunderstanding his intention.</p>

<p>The dealer may take up the trump card at any time during the
play of the hand; but it is usual to leave it on the pack until it is
played to a trick. No one but the dealer can take the trump into
his hand.</p>

<p><i><b>TURNING DOWN THE TRUMP.</b></i> If the dealer fears
that he and his partner cannot make three tricks with the turn-up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
suit for trumps, or would prefer to have the suit changed, he can
pass. If he passes, he takes the trump card from the top of the
pack, and places it face upward, and partly under the pack, in
such a manner that it can be distinctly seen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/p269.jpg" width="440" height="100" alt="[🃘 on top of pack covering facedown card] [Facedown pack covering 🃘]" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap spacer">Taken Up.</span> <span class="smcap spacer">Turned Down.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i><b>CHANGING THE TRUMP.</b></i> It then becomes the turn
of the other players, each in succession to the left of the dealer, to
name some other suit for the trump, or to pass a second time. If
the suit of the same colour as the turn-up is named for the new
trump, it is usual to say: “<i><b>I make it next</b></i>.” If a suit of a
different colour is named, it is called <i><b>crossing the suit</b></i>, and
some players, if a red suit is turned, will say: “I <i><b>cross</b></i> to clubs.”</p>

<p>Any player naming a new suit may announce to play alone at
the same time. The side that makes the new trump must make at
least three tricks, or it will be euchred, and the adversaries will
count two points. If a player names the suit that has just been
turned down, he loses his right to make the trump; and if he
corrects himself, and names another suit, he debars not only himself
but his partner from making the trump. One player having
named a new trump suit in his proper turn, his decision is binding
on all the others; but should a player name a suit out of his
proper turn, both he and his partner are debarred from making
that suit the trump. If no one will name a new trump, the deal is
void, and passes to the next player on the dealer’s left.</p>

<p><i><b>ORDERING UP THE TRUMP.</b></i> Instead of passing
the turn-up trump on the first round, any player who thinks it
would be to his advantage to have the turn-up remain the trump,
may order the dealer to take it up. In doing so he says: “<i><b>I
order it</b></i>,” if he is an adversary; or: “<i><b>I assist</b></i>,” if he is the
dealer’s partner. In either case the player making the trump may
announce a lone hand at the same time. His side must make at
least three tricks, whether he plays alone or not, or it is a euchre,
and the adversaries will count two points. In case an adversary
of the dealer plays alone, he must distinctly announce it when he
orders up the trump. The usual expression is: “<i><b>I order it
alone</b></i>.” His partner then lays his cards face downward on the
table and takes no further part in the play of that hand. If he exposes
any card of the abandoned hand, the adversaries can call
upon him to take up the hand and play it, leaving the exposed card<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
on the table as liable to be called. This of course prevents the
lone hand.</p>

<p>If the dealer’s partner wishes to play alone, instead of assisting,
he says: “<i><b>I play this alone</b></i>,” and the dealer lays down his
cards, leaving the trump on the pack.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYING ALONE.</b></i> No player but the one that takes up,
orders up, or makes the trump can play a lone hand. If the
dealer takes up the trump card of his own accord, he can play
alone. If any player orders up or assists, that player can play alone.
Any player making a new trump after the first has been turned
down, can play alone. If one player orders up the trump, neither
his partner nor his adversary can play alone; and if the dealer’s
partner assists, that prevents the dealer from playing a lone hand.
In many clubs the mistake is made of allowing the dealer to play
alone on his partner’s assist; or letting the pone play alone after
the dealer has been assisted; or letting the partner of the player
who makes the new trump play alone. This is not good Euchre,
because it gives an unfair advantage to one side, as we shall see
when we come to the suggestions for good play, especially in
connection with ordering up at what is called the “bridge;” that
is, when the score is 4 to 1, or 4 to 0.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The trump settled, the eldest
hand, or the player next him on the left, if the partner of the eldest
hand is playing alone, begins by leading any card he pleases, and
the others must follow suit if they can. Failure to follow suit
when able is a <i><b>revoke</b></i>, if the error is not discovered and corrected
before the trick in which it occurs is turned and quitted. If the
player discovers his mistake in time, the card played in error
must be left on the table, and is liable to be called. When a revoke
is discovered and claimed by the adversaries, it is usual to
abandon the hand, and the adversaries of the revoking player can
either deduct two points from his score, or add two to their own
score, for every revoke made during the hand. The penalty cannot
be divided. If both sides revoke, the deal is void, and the
same dealer must deal again.</p>

<p>Any player having none of the suit led may either trump, or
throw away a card of another suit. The highest card played, if
of the suit led, wins the trick, trumps winning against all other
suits, and a higher trump winning a lower. The winner of the trick
may lead any card he pleases for the next trick, and so on, until
all five tricks have been played. If the dealer takes the trump into
his hand, any player naming it is liable to have his highest or lowest
trump called; but a player may ask and must be informed
what the trump suit is.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards Played in Error.</b></i> All cards led out of turn, played
in error, or two or more played to a trick, or dropped face upward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
on the table, are called <i><b>exposed cards</b></i>, and must be left face up
on the table. These must be played when called by the adversaries,
unless compliance with the demand would make the player
revoke; but the fact of their being exposed does not prevent their
being got rid of in the course of play if the opportunity offers.
Some persons imagine that the adversaries can prevent an exposed
card from being played; but such is not the case in Euchre. A
person playing a lone hand is not liable to any penalty for exposing
his cards, nor for leading out of turn, for he has no partner to
derive any benefit from the information conveyed.</p>

<p><i><b>Leading Out of Turn.</b></i> Should any person, not playing
alone, lead out of turn, the adversaries may call a suit from the
player in error, or from his partner, when it is next the turn of
either of them to lead. The demand must be made by the person
who will be the last player on the trick in which the suit is called.
If all have played to the lead before discovering the error, it cannot
be rectified; but if all have not played, those who have followed
the false lead must take back their cards, which are not
liable to be called.</p>

<p>Any player may ask the others to <i><b>draw cards</b></i> in any trick,
provided he does so before the cards are touched for the purpose
of gathering them. In answer to this demand, each player should
indicate which card of those on the table he played. No one is
allowed to see any trick that has been turned and quitted.</p>

<p><i><b>Taking Tricks.</b></i> As the tricks are taken they should be
neatly laid one upon the other in such a manner that any player at
the table can count them. All tricks belonging to one side should
be kept together. At the end of each hand the score should be
claimed and marked. Revokes must be detected and claimed before
the cards are cut for the following deal.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING OUT.</b></i> When the play is confined to four
players, rubbers are usually played, and the table is complete with
six persons, two looking on, and awaiting their turn. At the end
of a rubber, if there are more than four players belonging to the
table, those who have just played cut to decide which shall give
place to those waiting, the players cutting the highest cards going
out. If six belong to the table, there will be no further cutting
out, as those who are out for one rubber re-enter for the next,
taking the places of those who have played two consecutive rubbers.
If five belong to the table, the three who remained in for
the second rubber must cut to allow the fifth player to re-enter.
At the end of the third rubber, the two cut that have not yet been
out; and at the end of the fourth rubber the one who has played
every rubber goes out without cutting. Partners and deal are cut
for at the beginning of each new rubber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>METHODS OF CHEATING.</b></i> All the Euchre family of
games, especially Écarté and Napoleon, offer numerous opportunities
to the greek. So well is this known in Europe that it is considered
extremely foolish for any person to play Écarté in mixed
companies. The small number of cards in the pack, and the custom
of dealing two and three at a time, gives the dealer an opportunity
to bunch four valuable cards, of which he can give
himself three, and turn up the fourth. False shuffles, shifted cuts,
and marked cards are formidable weapons. The telegraph between
partners, and the variation in tone or words in passing are
frequently used by card-sharpers. One of the commonest devices
in America is the use of what are known as “jack strippers.”
These are two Jacks, usually both of the same colour, which can be
withdrawn from any portion of the pack by the fingers of an expert,
and placed on the top. When the sharp deals, he places
cards enough on these to supply the other players on the first
round, so that the strippers will come to him. When only two
are playing, he strips them out and leaves them on the top when
he cuts the cards, so that they shall be dealt to him. Never play
Euchre or Écarté with a man who cuts the pack with both hands.</p>

<p>Any person who is tempted to bet on any game in the Euchre
family should remember the advice of the worldly-wise Parisian to
his son: “Until you have four eyes in your head, risk not your
gold at Écarté.”</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> The chief
points for the beginner to understand are. When to order up;
when to assist; when to take up; when to play alone; and what
to make the trump if it is turned down. His decision in each
case will be governed largely by his position at the table, and by
the score. The following suggestions are for four players, two
being partners against the other two, and playing without the
Joker; that being the most common form of the game. The general
principles underlying these suggestions for the four-handed
game will be found equally valuable in any form of Euchre.</p>

<p><i><b>ORDERING UP.</b></i> Although probabilities are of little practical
value in Euchre, it may be well to remember that there are
nine cards in the trump suit; but as only two-thirds of the pack
is dealt out, the average number of trumps among four players
will be six. Of these, the dealer always has the advantage of being
sure of one more than his share, and it is safe to reckon upon
the dealer to hold at least two trumps. He may also be counted
for a missing suit, for he will discard any losing card of an odd
suit when he takes up the trump.</p>

<p><i><b>The Eldest Hand</b></i> should not order up the trump unless he has
such cards that he is reasonably certain of three tricks without any
assistance from his partner, and cannot be sure of two tricks if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the trump is turned down. When he holds one or two bowers,
especially if he has cards of the next suit; that is, the suit of the
same colour as the turn-up, he should always pass; because if the
dealer takes it up he will probably be euchred, and if he turns it
down, the eldest hand will have the first say, and can make it
next. It is seldom right to order up a bower, because the dealer
will rarely turn down such a card.</p>

<p>There are exceptional cases in which the eldest hand may order
up with little or nothing. One of the most common is when the
adversaries of the dealer are at the <i><b>bridge</b></i>; that is, when their
score is 4, and the dealer’s side has only 1 or 2 marked. It is
obvious that if the dealer or his partner plays alone, he will win
the game; but if the trump is ordered up the most he can score is
2 points for a euchre, and the player who orders up will then have
a chance to go out on his own deal. For this reason it has come
to be regarded as imperative for the eldest hand to order up at the
bridge, unless he holds the right bower, or the left bower guarded,
or the ace twice guarded, any one of which combinations is certain
to win a trick against a lone hand if the eldest hand does not
lead trumps himself. Another case is when the score is 4 to 4,
and the eldest hand has average trump strength, good side cards,
but nothing in the next suit. It is better to order it up, and risk
the game on such a hand than to take the chance of the dealer’s
turning it down.</p>

<p><i><b>The Pone</b></i>, who is the partner of the eldest hand, orders up at
the bridge on exactly opposite principles. The fact that the eldest
hand did not order up shows that the dealer cannot make a lone
hand. This should indicate to the pone that his partner has a
certain trick in trumps, and if the pone holds any good trumps
himself, he can often guess what his partner’s trumps are. For
instance: The ace is turned, and the pone holds the left bower
guarded. The eldest hand must have the right bower, or four
trumps to the King. If the eldest hand has passed at the bridge,
and the pone has strong trumps himself, especially the ace or left
bower and two small trumps, he should order up the trump; not
to save the game, but to be sure of winning it by preventing the
dealer from turning it down. If the pone does not order up at
the bridge, the eldest hand may infer that he is weak in trumps.</p>

<p>When it is not a bridge, the pone should be guided by the same
principles as those given for the eldest hand, because he may be
sure that his partner will make it next if it is turned down, unless
he has a certainty of three tricks by crossing.</p>

<p>If a player calls his partner’s attention to the fact that they are
at the bridge, both lose their right to order up.</p>

<p><i><b>ASSISTING.</b></i> The dealer’s partner usually assists on plain-suit
cards, such as two aces, rather than on trumps. The score<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and the turn-up trump will often be a guide as to whether or not
to assist. For instance: If the score is 1 all, or to 2 to 1, and a
bower is turned, it is rarely right to assist, because it prevents the
dealer from playing alone. If the partner has good suit cards,
they may be useful to make a march; if he has strong trumps,
especially if sure of three tricks, he should play alone, instead of
assisting. If the score is 3 in the dealer’s favour, he does not need
a lone hand to win the game, and with two reasonably certain
tricks in his own hand the dealer’s partner should assist, as they
may win the game by a march.</p>

<p>If the dealer’s side is at the bridge, the score being 4 to 1 or 4
to 0 in their favour, and the eldest hand passes, the dealer’s partner
must be on the alert to prevent the pone from placing a lone
hand. He should assist unless a bower is turned, or he has it
himself, or holds such cards that, combined with the turn-up, he
is sure of a trick. For instance: The dealer’s partner has the
King and two other trumps, and the ace is turned. It is impossible
for the pone to make a lone hand, even if he has both bowers,
and the ace is bare; for he cannot catch the King, even if his
partner leads the trump through it. But if a small trump was
turned, the pone might easily make a lone hand with both bowers
and the ace.</p>

<p><i><b>TAKING UP.</b></i> The average expectation of the dealer is
something over two trumps, including the turn-up. With more
than two trumps, or with two strong trumps, and a reasonably
certain trick in a plain suit, the dealer should take up the trump.
Three trumps of any size and an ace in plain suits is a strong take-up
hand. It is better to take up the trump with only one plain
suit in the hand, and small trumps, than with two strong trumps
and two weak plain suits. The score will often decide the dealer
in taking up the trump. For instance: At 4 all, it is useless to
turn anything down unless you have a certain euchre in the next
suit, and nothing in the turn-up. Even then, the adversaries are
almost certain to cross the suit and go out. With the score 3 all,
the dealer should be very careful about taking up on a weak hand,
because a euchre loses the game. If he is weak, but has a chance
in the next suit, or a bower in the cross suits, he should turn it
down. It is a common stratagem to turn it down for a euchre
when the dealer is better in the next suit, and has only 2 to go.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYING ALONE.</b></i> The dealer has the best chance to
get a lone hand; but the eldest hand is more likely to succeed
with one, on account of the advantage of the lead. It is an invariable
rule for any player to go alone when he has three certain
tricks, unless he is 3 up, and can win the game with a march. A
lone hand should be played with both bowers and the ace, no
matter how worthless the other cards; or with five trumps to the
ace without either bower; or two high trumps and three aces in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
plain suits; or three good trumps and two aces. The theory of
this is that while the march might possibly be made with partner’s
assistance, if partner has the cards necessary to make a march, the
adversaries have little or nothing, and there is a very good chance
to make a lone hand if three tricks of it are certain. Both bowers
and the ace, with only the seven and eight of a plain suit have
made many a lone hand. If the lone player is not caught on the
plain suit at the first trick, the adversaries may discard it to keep
higher cards in the other suit; or they may have none of it from
the first. There is always a chance, and it should be taken.</p>

<p>The dealer’s partner, and the pone, should be very careful in
playing lone hands, and should never risk them except with three
certain tricks, no matter what suit is led first.</p>

<p>With three sure tricks, some players make it a rule to play alone,
provided the two other cards are both of the same suit.</p>

<p><i><b>MAKING THE TRUMP.</b></i> When the trump is turned
down, the general rule is for the eldest hand to make it next. The
exceptions are when he has nothing in the next suit, but has at
least two certain tricks in the cross suit, and a probable trick in a
plain suit. It is safer to make it next with a weak hand than to
cross it on moderate strength, for the presumption is that neither
the dealer nor his partner had a bower in the turn-down suit, and
therefore have none in the next suit. Such being the case, it is
very likely that one or both may be strong in the cross suits,
and it is not considered good policy to cross the suit unless so
strong in it as to be reasonably certain of three tricks. Some
players invariably make it next, regardless of their hands, unless
they can play alone in the cross suit. Such a habit exposes them
to the common artifice of the dealer’s turning it down for a euchre.
A dealer holding a bower and three cards of the next suit, will
often turn it down, and trust to the eldest hand making it next,
which will give the dealer four trumps instead of two. The eldest
hand should be on his guard against this when the dealer’s side
has 3 scored.</p>

<p>The dealer’s partner, on the other hand, should cross the suit
almost as invariably as the eldest hand should make it next; for if
his partner cannot take up the trump, and the eldest hand cannot
make it next, their hands must be weak, and if it is passed to the
pone, he will probably turn out to have a lone hand. The best
chance is to cross the suit, unless the player has three certain tricks
in his own hand by making it next, such as five trumps to the ace,
or four trumps and a plain-suit ace. With such cards he should
play alone.</p>

<p>The pone should never make the trump unless he has three certain
tricks, and is willing to play a lone hand. If the dealer turns
it down, and both the eldest hand and the dealer’s partner pass a
second time, there must be a nigger in the woodpile somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>LEADING.</b></i> The general principle of leading is to make
tricks while you can. It is useless to save up tenaces in plain
suits, because there are only five tricks to play, two of which are
certain to fall to the trumps, and it is very improbable that any
player will lead up to you a small card of a plain suit that will go
round twice. It is seldom right to lead small cards of a plain suit.
There is a better chance to make a trick with the King by leading
it than by keeping it guarded. In the trump suit, tenaces are
very strong, and should be preserved, especially if the tenace is
over the turn-up trump. There is a familiar example of the importance
of tenace when only two play, in which one person holds
the major tenace in trumps, hearts, and must win three tricks, no
matter which player leads. The cards in one hand are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/p276a.jpg" width="260" height="75" alt="🂻 🂱 🂺 🂡 🂮" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">and those in the other hand are;&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/p276b.jpg" width="260" height="75" alt="🃋 🂾 🂽 🂹 🃑" />
</div>

<p>If the player with the major tenace has to lead first, all he has to
do is to force his adversary with the plain suit, spades. Whatever
the adversary leads, the player with the major tenace simply wins
it, and forces again. If the player with the four trumps has the
first lead, it does not matter what card he plays; the player with
the major tenace wins it, and forces with the plain suit. As long
as the major tenace in trumps is not led away from, it must win
three tricks in trumps.</p>

<p><i><b>Leading Trumps.</b></i> With strong cards in plain suits, the
eldest hand may often lead trumps to advantage if the dealer’s
partner has assisted, especially if the turn-up trump is small. It
is seldom right to lead trumps if the dealer has taken up the trump
of his own accord; but an exception is usually made when the
eldest hand holds three trumps, and two aces in plain suits. The
best chance for a euchre is to exhaust the trumps, so as to make
the aces good for tricks. If the pone has ordered up the trump,
the eldest hand should lead trumps to him immediately; but the
pone should not lead trumps to his partner if the eldest hand has
ordered up at the bridge. If a bower is turned, the dealer’s partner
should lead a small trump at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>In playing against a lone hand the best cards in plain suits
should always be led, trumps never. In playing alone, it is best
to lead winning trumps as long as they last, so as to force discards,
which will often leave intermediate cards in plain suits good
for tricks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Second Hand.</b></i> Play the best card you have second hand,
and cover everything led if you can. With King and another or
Queen and another, it is usually best to put up the honour second
hand, on a small card led.</p>

<p><i><b>Trumping.</b></i> It is seldom right to trump partner’s winning
cards, unless he has ordered up the trump, and you think you can
lead through the dealer to advantage. In playing against a lone
hand, it is sometimes good play to trump your partner’s ace with
an unguarded left bower or ace of trumps, as it may prevent the
dealer from getting into the lead with a small trump, and may
save a King or Queen of trumps in your partner’s hand. If you
don’t trump, the dealer will probably get in and swing the right
bower, and your trump will be lost.</p>

<p>If your partner has ordered, made, or taken up the trump, and
you have only one trump, even a bower, trump with it at the first
opportunity. Trump everything second hand, unless it takes the
right bower for a doubtful trick, or breaks into the major tenace
in trumps.</p>

<p><i><b>Discarding.</b></i> It is best to throw away singletons, unless
they are aces. If you have two cards of equal value, but of different
colours, one of which must be discarded, it is usual to keep
the one of the same colour as the turn-up when playing against
the dealer. Discard suits that the adversaries are trumping. If
your partner discards a suit in which you have a high card, keep
that suit, and discard another. If you have both ace and King of
a plain suit, discard the ace, to show partner that you can win a
trick in the suit. It is very often important to discard correctly
when playing against a lone hand, especially if the lone player leads
trumps for the fourth trick. It is a common practice for modern
players to signal in the discard if they have a certain trick in a
suit. This is done by discarding two cards in another suit, the
higher before the lower. For instance: You have two aces,
spades and diamonds. The dealer plays alone on hearts, and
trumps your spade ace the first time. If you have two clubs, such
as King and ten, discard the King first, and then the ten, and
your partner will know you can stop the diamond suit. This
should advise him to keep his clubs.</p>

<h3>CUT-THROAT EUCHRE.</h3>

<p>The chief element in the three-handed game is playing to the
score. The player with the strong hand must always be kind to
the under dog, and partnerships are always formed against the
man with the high score. Suppose <i><b>A</b></i>, <i><b>B</b></i>, and <i><b>C</b></i> are playing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
that <i><b>A</b></i> has 3 points to his adversaries’ nothing on <i><b>B’s</b></i> deal. It is
to the interest of <i><b>A</b></i> to euchre <i><b>B</b></i>; but it is to the interest of <i><b>C</b></i> to
let <i><b>B</b></i> make his point because if <i><b>B</b></i> is euchred, <i><b>A</b></i> wins the game.
<i><b>B</b></i> having made his point, <i><b>C</b></i> deals, and it is then to the interest of
<i><b>B</b></i> to let <i><b>C</b></i> make his point. Suppose <i><b>C</b></i> makes a march, 3 points,
which puts him on a level with <i><b>A</b></i>. On <i><b>A’s</b></i> deal it is <i><b>C’s</b></i> game to
euchre him, but <i><b>B</b></i> must let <i><b>A</b></i> make his point; so that instead of
being opposed by both <i><b>B</b></i> and <i><b>C</b></i>, as he was a moment ago, <i><b>A</b></i>
finds a friend in <i><b>B</b></i>, and the two who were helping each other to
beat <i><b>A</b></i>, are now cutting each other’s throats. On <i><b>B’s</b></i> deal, <i><b>A</b></i>
does not want to euchre him, for although that would win the
game for both <i><b>A</b></i> and <i><b>C</b></i>, <i><b>A</b></i>, who now has 4 points up, does not
wish to divide the pool with <i><b>C</b></i> while he has such a good chance
to win it all himself. Suppose <i><b>B</b></i> makes his point. <i><b>A</b></i> will do all
he can to euchre <i><b>C</b></i>, but <i><b>B</b></i> will oppose the scheme, because his
only chance for the game is that <i><b>A</b></i> will not be able to take up the
trump on his own deal, and that <i><b>B</b></i> will make a march.</p>

<h3>SET-BACK EUCHRE.</h3>

<p>This is simply a reversal of the ordinary method of scoring, the
players starting with a certain number of points, usually ten, and
deducting what they make on each deal. The peculiarity which
gives the game its name is that if a player is euchred he is <i><b>set
back</b></i> two points, his adversaries counting nothing. The revoke
penalty is settled in the same way. The game is usually counted
with chips, each player starting with ten, and placing in the centre
of the table those that he is entitled to score.</p>

<h3>BLIND EUCHRE.</h3>

<p>Each player is for himself and a widow of two cards is dealt.
The player who takes the widow practically orders up the trump
and must play against all the others after discarding two cards. If
no one will take the widow, the deal is void.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<h3>PENALTY EUCHRE.</h3>

<p>Five players are each provided with twelve counters. An extra
hand of five cards is dealt face down, for a widow. Each player in
turn can exchange the hand dealt him for the widow, or for the
hand abandoned by anyone who has taken the widow, the cards
being always face down. The turned trump is not taken up by the
dealer, but is left on the pack. The eldest hand leads for the first
trick and every man is for himself, each holding his own tricks.</p>

<p>At the end of the hand, each player that has not taken a trick
receives a counter from each of the others, whether they have taken
tricks or not. Then all those that have won tricks put back into
the pool a counter for each trick they have taken. The first player
to get rid of his twelve counters wins the game.</p>

<h3>AUCTION EUCHRE.</h3>

<p>This form of the game is sometimes erroneously called <i><b>French
Euchre</b></i>. The French know nothing about Euchre in any form.
Auction Euchre is exactly the same as the ordinary four or six-handed
game, except that the trump is not turned up, the players
bidding in turn for the privilege of naming the trump suit. The
bidder names the number of tricks he proposes to take. There is
no second bid, and the player who has made the highest bid names
the trump suit. No matter who is the successful bidder, the eldest
hand leads for the first trick. The number of points won or lost
on the deal are the number of points bid, even if the bidder accomplishes
more. If a player has bid 3, and he and his partner
take 4 or 5 tricks, they count 3 only. If they are euchred, failing
to make the number of tricks bid, the adversaries count the number
of points bid. Fifteen points is usually the game.</p>

<p>This is probably the root of the much better games of five and
seven-handed Euchre, which will be described further on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<h3>PROGRESSIVE EUCHRE.</h3>

<p>This form of Euchre is particularly well suited to social gatherings.
Its peculiarity consists in the arrangement and progression
of a large number of players originally divided into sets of four,
and playing, at separate tables, the ordinary four-handed game.</p>

<p><i><b>Apparatus.</b></i> A sufficient number of tables to accommodate
the assembled players are arranged in order, and numbered consecutively;
No. 1 being called <i><b>the head table</b></i>, and the lowest of
the series <i><b>the booby table</b></i>. Each player is provided with a
blank card, to which the various coloured stars may be attached
as they accrue in the course of play. These stars are usually of
three colours; red, green, and gold. The head table is provided
with a bell, and each table is supplied with one pack of cards only.
It is usual to sort out the thirty-two cards used in play, and the
four small cards for markers, before the arrival of the guests.</p>

<p><i><b>Drawing for Positions.</b></i> Two packs of differently coloured
cards are used, and from the two black suits in each a
sequence of cards is sorted out, equal in length to the number of
tables in play. For instance: If there are sixteen ladies and sixteen
gentlemen, or thirty-two players in all, they will fill eight
tables, and all the clubs and spades from the ace to the eight inclusive
should be sorted out. These are then thoroughly shuffled
and presented, face down, to the players to draw from. The
ladies take only the red-back cards, and the gentlemen only the
blue. The number of pips on the card drawn indicates the number
of the table at which the player is to sit, and those drawing
cards of the same suit are partners for the first game.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing.</b></i> All being seated, the deal is cut for at each table,
and play begins. There is no cutting for partners, that being
settled in the original drawing. Five points is a game, and after
that number is reached by either side at the head table, the bell is
struck. Lone hands are usually barred at the head table, so as to
give the other tables time to make a certain number of points, and
so to avoid ties. Upon the tap of the bell all play immediately
ceases, even if in the middle of a deal. If the players at any but
the head table have reached five points before the bell rings, they
play on, counting all points made until the bell taps.</p>

<p><i><b>Progressing.</b></i> The partners winning the game at the head
table each receive a gold star, and retain their seats for the next
game. The losing players at the head table go down to the booby
table. All the winning players at the other tables receive red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
stars, and go to the table next in order above, those at table No. 2,
going to No. 1. Those losing and remaining at the booby table
each receive a green star.</p>

<p><i><b>Changing Partners.</b></i> At all but the head table the partners
that progress to the next table divide, the lady who has just lost at
each table retains her seat, and takes for her partner the gentleman
who has just arrived from the table below. At the head
table the newly arrived pair remain as partners; but at the booby
table the players who have just arrived from the head table divide.
All being seated, they cut for the deal, and play is resumed
until the next bell tap.</p>

<p><i><b>Ties.</b></i> In case of ties in points at any table when the bell taps,
those having won the most tricks on the next hand are declared
the winners. If that is also a tie, the ladies cut to decide it, the
lowest cut going up. In cutting, the ace is low, and the jack
ranks below the Queen.</p>

<p><i><b>Prizes.</b></i> Six prizes are usually provided for large companies.
The lady and gentleman having the largest number of gold stars
taking the first prizes; the largest number of red stars winning
the second prizes; and the largest number of green stars the
booby prizes. One player cannot win two prizes. In case of ties
for the gold stars, the accompanying red stars decide it; if that is
also a tie, the player with the fewest number of green stars wins;
and if that is still a tie, the players must cut for it.</p>

<p>The hostess decides the hour at which play shall cease, and is
the referee in all disputes.</p>

<h3>MILITARY EUCHRE.</h3>

<p>The hostess arranges each table as a fort, with a distinguishing
flag and a number of small duplicate flags. The partners who sit
East and West progress round the room from table to table, and
play one game of five points at each, no lone hands allowed. The
winners of each game get a little flag from the losers as a trophy.
By the time the E and W pairs have made the circuit of all the
tables and got home again, the game is ended, the victors being the
fort that has captured the greatest number of flags.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<h3>RAILROAD EUCHRE.</h3>

<p>Railroad Euchre is the name given to any form of the four-handed
game in which every expedient is used to make points
rapidly.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards.</b></i> A pack of twenty-five cards is used, all below the 9
being deleted, and the Joker added. The Joker is always the best
trump.</p>

<p><i><b>Players.</b></i> There are four players, two being partners against
the other two. Partners, deal, and seats are cut for as in the
ordinary game.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> The cards are distributed as in the ordinary game;
but it is usual to agree beforehand upon a suit which shall be the
trump if the Joker is turned up.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing Alone.</b></i> The chief peculiarity in Railroad Euchre is
in playing alone. Any player announcing to play alone, whether
the dealer or not, has the privilege of passing a card, face down,
to his partner. In exchange for this, but without seeing it, the
partner gives the best card in his hand to the lone player, passing
it to him face down. If he has not a trump to give him, he can
pass him an ace, or even a King. Even if this card is no better
than the one discarded, the lone player cannot refuse it. If the
dealer plays alone, he has two discards; the first in exchange for
his partner’s best card, and then another, in exchange for the
trump card, after seeing what his partner can give him. In this
second discard he may get rid of the card passed to him by his
partner. If the dealer’s partner plays alone, the dealer may pass
him the turn-up trump, or any better card he may have in his
hand.</p>

<p>Any person having announced to play alone, either of his adversaries
may play alone against him; discarding and taking partner’s
best card in the same manner. Should the lone player who
makes the trump be euchred by the lone player opposing him, the
euchre counts four points. It is considered imperative for a player
holding the Joker, or the right bower guarded, to play alone
against the lone hand, taking his partner’s best; for as it is evident
that the lone hand cannot succeed, there is a better chance to
euchre it with all the strength in one hand than divided.</p>

<p>If any player, in his proper turn, announces to play alone, and
asks for his partner’s best, the partner cannot refuse; neither can
he propose to play alone instead.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> With the exception of the four points for euchreing
a lone hand, the scoring is exactly the same as in the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
four-handed game; but there are one or two variations which are
sometimes agreed upon beforehand in order to make points still
more rapidly.</p>

<p><i><b>Laps.</b></i> If a player makes more points than are necessary to
win the game, the additional points are counted on the next game,
so that there is always an inducement to play lone hands, even
with 4 points up.</p>

<p><i><b>Slams.</b></i> If one side reaches five points before the other has
scored, it is a slam, and counts <i><b>two games</b></i>.</p>

<p>When laps and slams are played, it is sometimes agreed that if
a person plays alone without taking his partner’s best card, or
the dealer plays alone without taking up the trump or asking for
his partners best, and such a player succeeds in winning all five
tricks with a pat hand, it counts <i><b>five</b></i> points. If he fails to win all
five tricks, the adversaries count <i><b>one</b></i>. If he is euchred, they
count <i><b>three</b></i>; but they are not permitted to play alone against
him.</p>

<p><i><b>Jambone.</b></i> Any person playing a lone hand may announce
Jambone, and expose his cards face up on the table. The adversaries
then have me right to call any card they please, either for
the lead, or in following suit; but they cannot make the player revoke,
nor can they consult, or in any way expose their hands. If a
lead is required, it must be called by the person on the jambone
player’s left. If a card is called on a trick, it must be called by
the person on the jambone player’s right. If in spite of these difficulties
the jambone player succeeds in winning five tricks, he
scores <i><b>eight</b></i> points. If he wins three or four only, he counts <i><b>one</b></i>
point. If he is euchred he loses <i><b>two</b></i>. It is not allowable to play
alone against a jambone.</p>

<p><i><b>Jamboree.</b></i> This is the combination of the five highest trumps
in one hand, and need only be announced and shown to entitle the
holder to score <i><b>sixteen</b></i> points. If held by the dealer, it may be
made with the assistance of the turn-up trump; and any player
may make it with the assistance of his partners best; but it does
not count unless the holder of it has made the trump. If a player
with a pat Jamboree is ordered up, all he can score is a euchre.</p>

<p>As in other forms of Euchre, no one but the maker of the trump
can play alone, or announce Jambone or Jamboree. Lone hands
are very common in Railroad Euchre, and ordering up to prevent
lone hands is commoner still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<h3>SEVEN-HANDED EUCHRE.</h3>

<p><i><b>Cards.</b></i> Seven-handed Euchre is played with a full pack of
fifty-three cards, including the Joker. The cards in plain suits
rank as at Whist; but the Joker is always the best trump, the
right and left bowers being the second and third-best respectively.</p>

<p><i><b>Counters.</b></i> One white and four red counters are necessary.
The white counter is passed to the left from player to player in
turn, to indicate the position of the next deal. The red counters
are placed in front of the maker of the trump and his partners,
to distinguish them from their opponents. Markers are not used,
the score being kept on a sheet of paper. The score is usually
kept by a person who is not playing, in order that none of those in
the game may know how the various scores stand. Should an
outsider not be available for scoring, there are two methods: One
is for one player to keep the score for the whole table, who must
inform any player of the state of the score if asked to do so. The
other is to have a dish of counters on the table, each player being
given the number he wins from time to time. These should be
placed in some covered receptacle, so that they cannot be counted
by their owner, and no other player will know how many he has.
As it is very seldom that a successful bid is less than five, and
never less than four, counters marked as being worth 4, 5, 6 and 7
each will answer every purpose, and will pay every bid made.</p>

<p><i><b>Cutting.</b></i> The players draw cards from an outspread pack for
the choice of seats, those cutting the lowest cards having the first
choice. The lowest cut of all deals the first hand, passing the
white counter to the player on his left, whose turn it will be to deal
next. Ties are decided in the usual way.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> The cards are dealt from left to right, two being
given to each player for the first round, then three, and then two
again, until each player has received seven cards. The four remaining
in the pack are then placed in the centre of the table, face
down, and form the <i><b>widow</b></i>. No trump is turned.</p>

<p>The rules governing all irregularities in the deal are the same as
in ordinary Euchre.</p>

<p><i><b>Making the Trump.</b></i> The cards dealt, each player in turn,
beginning with the eldest hand, bids a certain number of points, at
the same time naming the suit which he wishes to make the trump.
There is no second bid, and the suit named by the highest bidder
must be the trump for that deal. The successful bidder takes the
widow, selecting from it what cards he pleases, and discarding
others in their stead, so as to restore the number of his cards to
seven. He then places a red counter in front of him, and chooses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
his partners, passing a red counter to each of them. These counters
must be placed in front of the players to distinguish them as
belonging to the bidder’s side; but the players make no changes in
their respective positions at the table. Each player should bid on
the possibilities of his hand, however small, so as to guide the
others in their selection of partners.</p>

<p><i><b>Partners.</b></i> If the bidder has proposed to take not more than
<i><b>five</b></i> tricks out of the seven possible, he chooses two partners, and
these three play against the remaining four. If he has bid to make
<i><b>six</b></i> or <i><b>seven</b></i> tricks he chooses three partners, and these four play
against the remaining three. Partners cannot refuse to play.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing Alone.</b></i> Should a player think he can take all seven
tricks without any partners, he may bid <i><b>ten</b></i>, which would outrank
a bid of seven; but such a bid must be made before seeing the
widow. If a player thinks he can win all seven tricks without either
widow or partners, he may bid <i><b>twenty</b></i>, which is the highest bid
possible. When twenty is bid the cards in the widow must remain
untouched.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing.</b></i> The successful bidder has the lead for the first
trick. The general rules for following suit, etc., are the same as in
ordinary Euchre. The bidder takes in all the tricks won by himself
and his partners, and one of the adversaries should gather for
that side. If a player on either side <i><b>revokes</b></i>, the adversaries
score the number bid, and the hand is abandoned.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> If the bidder is successful in his undertaking, he
and his partners, if any, are credited by the scorer with the number
of points bid, but no more. Should a player bid five, and his
side take seven, it would count them only five points. If the
player making the trump fails to reach his bid, he is euchred, and
the adversaries are credited with the number of points bid.</p>

<p><i><b>Prizes.</b></i> It is usual to give two prizes for each table in play;
one for the highest number of points won during the evening, and
one for the smallest number; the latter being usually called the
“booby” prize.</p>

<p><i><b>Suggestions for Good Play.</b></i> It is very risky to bid seven
without the Joker, the odds being 11 to 1 against finding it in the
widow. A bid of ten should not be made without both Joker and
Right Bower, and all the other cards winners and trumps. To bid
twenty, a player should have a practically invincible hand, with at
least five winning leads of trumps.</p>

<p>The first bidders are always at a disadvantage, because they
know nothing of the contents of the other hands; but after one or
two players have made a bid, those following them can judge pretty
well how the cards lie. For instance: The seven players are <i><b>A</b></i> <i><b>B</b></i>
<i><b>C</b></i> <i><b>D</b></i> <i><b>E</b></i> <i><b>F</b></i> <i><b>G</b></i>. <i><b>A</b></i> deals, and <i><b>B</b></i> bids 2 in hearts. <i><b>C</b></i> and <i><b>D</b></i> pass.
<i><b>E</b></i> bids 3 in clubs; and <i><b>F</b></i> says 4 in hearts. It is evident that <i><b>F</b></i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
is bidding on <i><b>B’s</b></i> offer in hearts, and intends to choose him for a
partner. <i><b>G</b></i> finds in his hand four good spades and the Joker, but
neither Bower. He may safely bid 5 or 6, taking <i><b>E</b></i> for a partner
if successful, as <i><b>E</b></i> very probably has one or both the black
Bowers. If he bids 5 only, the dealer, <i><b>A</b></i>, would have an excellent
chance to bid 6 in hearts, and to take <i><b>B</b></i> and <i><b>F</b></i> for two of his
partners, and <i><b>G</b></i> for the third, trusting to find him with the Joker,
or at least protection in one or both black suits.</p>

<p>If the successful bidder has had no previous bids to guide him
in his choice of partners, he should take those who have the lowest
scores, if the scores are known; because it is to his advantage
to avoid advancing those who are perhaps already ahead. When
the scores are not known, there is nothing but luck to guide one,
unless a person has a very good memory, and knows which players
are probably behind.</p>

<p><i><b>Leading.</b></i> If the successful bidder wants 6 or 7 tricks, and
holds the Joker, he should lead it at once. If he has not the
Joker, he should begin with a low trump, and give his partners a
chance to play the Joker on the first round. If the leader cannot
exhaust the trumps with one or two rounds, it will sometimes be
to his advantage to lead any losing card he may have in the plain
suits, in order to let his partners win the trick if they can. In
playing alone, it is absolutely necessary to exhaust the trumps before
opening a plain suit.</p>

<p>Partners should avail themselves of the methods common to
four-handed Euchre to support one another in trumps and plain
suits. The discard should invariably be from weakness if the
player is the bidder’s partner; and from strength, if opposed to
him.</p>

<p><i><b>EUCHRE FOR FIVE PLAYERS.</b></i> This is practically
the same as the seven-handed game, but the pack is reduced to
28 cards, all below the Eight in each suit being deleted. The
Joker is not used. Five cards are dealt to each player, by two
and three at a time, and the three remaining form the widow.
The player bidding <i><b>three</b></i> tricks takes one partner only. The
player bidding <i><b>four</b></i> or <i><b>five</b></i> tricks, takes two partners. A player
who intends to take the widow, but no partners, can bid <i><b>eight</b></i>
and one who intends to take neither widow nor partners can bid
<i><b>fifteen</b></i>. In this form of Euchre the scores are generally known,
and 100 points is game.</p>

<p>In some clubs it is the practice for the successful bidder to
select one of his partners by asking for the holder of a certain
card. For instance: B has the lead, and has bid five in hearts,
holding the three best trumps, the club ace, and a losing spade.
Instead of selecting his partners at random, he asks for the spade
ace, and the player holding that card must say, “Here”; upon
which the bidder will pass him a counter, marking him as one of
his partners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<h3>CALL-ACE EUCHRE.</h3>

<p>In this variety of euchre, each player is for himself so far as the
final score goes. The one who takes up the trump or orders it up,
or who makes it after it is turned down, may call upon the best card
of any suit but the trump. The player holding the best card of that
suit must be his partner, but he does not declare himself. When
the highest card of the suit asked for falls in play, the partner is
disclosed.</p>

<p>As the whole pack is not dealt out, it often happens that the ace,
or even both ace and king, of the suit called for are in the talon.
Should it turn out that the caller has the highest card of the suit
himself, he has no partner.</p>

<p>When six play, 32 cards are used, and only one remains unknown.
When five play, the sevens are thrown out. When four play, the
eights are also discarded.</p>

<p>If the maker of the trump does not want a partner, he may either
say “alone” or he may ask for a suit of which he holds the ace
himself.</p>

<p>If the maker of the trump and his partner get three tricks, they
score 1 point each. If they win all the tricks, they score 3 points
each if there are five or six in the game; 2 points if there are not
more than four players. If the partnership is euchred, each of the
others at the table scores 2 points.</p>

<p>For a lone hand, winning all five tricks, the player scores a point
for as many players as there are at the table, including himself.
Euchres score 2 for every other player but the lone hand. A lone
hand making three or four tricks only, scores 1.</p>

<h3>500, OR BID EUCHRE.</h3>

<p>In this variety of euchre, the joker is always used. When there
is a trump suit, it is the best trump; but when there are no trumps,
it is a suit by itself, but still a trump. The player holding it cannot
trump with it as long as he can follow suit; but when he has
none of the suit led, he can trump with the joker if he likes. When
the joker is led in a no-trump hand, the leader must name the suit
that he wishes played to it.</p>

<p>Five hundred is supposed to be a game for three players, but
sometimes two play against two as partners.</p>

<p>The dealer gives ten cards to each player, three and then two at
a time as in the ordinary game of euchre; but after dealing the first
three cards to each he lays off three cards face down for a widow.
This widow is taken in hand by the successful bidder, who discards
three cards in its place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>The players bid for the privilege of naming the trump suit, or of
playing without any trump but the joker. The number of tricks
bid must not be less than six, and the suit must be named at the
same time. The player having the most valuable game, regardless
of the number of tricks or the suit, is the successful bidder,
because a bid of seven in hearts, for instance, is worth more in
points than a bid of eight in clubs, as will be seen from the following
table.</p>

<p>The successful bidder always leads for the first trick, after he
has taken the widow and discarded, and after the hand is played, he
has the first count. If he has made as many as he bid, he scores
it; but he cannot score more than he bid unless he succeeds in
winning every trick. In that case he scores 250 if his bid was less
than 250; but if his bid was more than 250, he gets nothing extra
for winning every trick.</p>

<p>Any player but the bidder winning a trick scores ten points for
it, so it is necessary for each player to keep separate the tricks he
individually wins.</p>

<p>If the bidder fails, he loses, or is set back, as many points as he
bid, and he scores nothing for the tricks he takes, but he may play
the hand out to prevent the others from scoring, as his adversaries
still get ten points for each trick they win.</p>

<p>Five hundred points is game, and as the bidder has the first count
he may go out first, even if an adversary has won tricks enough to
reach 500 also.</p>

<h3>EUCHRE LAWS.</h3>

<p><i><b>1.</b></i> <i><b>SCORING.</b></i> A game consists of five points. If the
players making the trump win all five tricks, they count <i><b>two</b></i>
points towards game; if they win three or four tricks, they count
<i><b>one</b></i> point; if they fail to win three tricks, their adversaries count
<i><b>two</b></i> points.</p>

<p><i><b>2.</b></i> If the player making the trump plays <i><b>alone</b></i>, and makes
five tricks, he counts as many points as there are players in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
game: Two, if two play; three if three play; four if four play,
etc. If he wins three or four tricks only, he counts one; if he
fails to win three tricks, his adversaries count two.</p>

<p><i><b>3.</b></i> <i><b>The Rubber</b></i> is the best of three games. If the first two
are won by the same players, the third game is not played. The
winners gain a <i><b>triple</b></i>, or three points, if their adversaries have
not scored; a <i><b>double</b></i>, or two points, if their adversaries are less
than three scored; a <i><b>single</b></i>, or one point, if their adversaries
have scored three or four. The winners of the rubber add two
points to the value of their games, and deduct the points made by
the losers, if any; the remainder being the value of the rubber.</p>

<p><i><b>4.</b></i> <i><b>FORMING THE TABLE.</b></i> A Euchre table is complete
with six players. If more than four assemble, they cut for
the preference, the four lowest playing the first rubber. Partners
and deal are then cut for, the two lowest pairing against the two
highest. The lowest deals, and has the choice of seats and cards.</p>

<p><i><b>5.</b></i> <i><b>Ties.</b></i> Players cutting cards of equal value cut again, but
the new cut decides nothing but the tie.</p>

<p><i><b>6.</b></i> <i><b>Cutting Out.</b></i> At the end of a rubber the players cut to
decide which shall give way to those awaiting their turn to play.
After the second rubber, those who have played the greatest number
of consecutive games give way; ties being decided by cutting.</p>

<p><i><b>7.</b></i> <i><b>Cutting.</b></i> In cutting, the ace is low, the other cards ranking,
K Q J 10 9 8 7, the King being the highest. A player exposing
more than one card, or cutting the Joker, must cut again.</p>

<p><i><b>8.</b></i> <i><b>SHUFFLING.</b></i> Every player has a right to shuffle the
cards, the dealer last.</p>

<p><i><b>9.</b></i> <i><b>DEALING.</b></i> The dealer must present the pack to the
pone to be cut. At least four cards must be left in each packet.
If a card is exposed in cutting, the pack must be reshuffled, and
cut again. If the dealer reshuffles the pack after it has been
properly cut, he loses his deal.</p>

<p><i><b>10.</b></i> Beginning on his left, the dealer must give to each player
in rotation <i><b>two</b></i> cards on the first round, and <i><b>three</b></i> on the second;
or three to each on the first round, and two on the second. Five
cards having been given to each player in this manner, the next
card is turned up for the trump. The deal passes to the left.</p>

<p><i><b>11.</b></i> There must be a new deal by the same dealer if any
card but the trump is found faced in the pack, or if the pack is
proved incorrect or imperfect; but any previous scores made with
the imperfect pack stand good.</p>

<p><i><b>12.</b></i> The adversaries may demand a new deal if any card but
the trump is exposed during the deal, provided they have not
touched a card. If an adversary exposes a card, the dealer may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
elect to deal again. If a new deal is not demanded, cards exposed
in dealing cannot be called.</p>

<p><i><b>13.</b></i> The adversaries may stop a player dealing out of turn, or
with the wrong pack, provided they do so before the trump card
is turned, after which the deal stands good.</p>

<p><i><b>14.</b></i> <i><b>MISDEALING.</b></i> A misdeal loses the deal. It is a
misdeal: If the cards have not been properly cut; if the dealer
gives two cards to one player and three to another in the same
round; if he gives too many or too few cards to any player; if he
counts the cards on the table, or those remaining in the pack; or
if he deals a card incorrectly, and fails to correct the error before
dealing another. If the dealer is interrupted in any manner by an
adversary, he does not lose his deal.</p>

<p><i><b>15.</b></i> <i><b>THE TRUMP CARD.</b></i> After the trump card is
turned, each player in turn, beginning with the eldest hand, has
the privilege of passing, assisting, or ordering up the trump.
Should a player pass, and afterward correct himself by ordering
up or assisting, both he and his partner may be prevented by the
adversaries from exercising their privilege. If a player calls his
partner’s attention to the fact that they are at the bridge, both
lose their right to order up the trump.</p>

<p><i><b>16.</b></i> The dealer may leave the trump card on the pack until it
is got rid of in the course of play. If the trump card has been
taken up or played, any player may ask, and must be informed by
the dealer, what the trump suit is; but any player naming the
trump card may be called upon by an adversary to play his highest
or lowest trump.</p>

<p><i><b>17.</b></i> If the dealer takes up, or is ordered up, he must <i><b>discard</b></i>
a card from his own hand, placing it under the remainder of the
pack. Having quitted such discard, it cannot be taken back. If
the dealer has not discarded until he has played to the first trick,
he and his partner cannot score any points for that hand.</p>

<p><i><b>18.</b></i> If the eldest hand leads before the dealer has quitted his
discard, the dealer may amend his discard, but the eldest hand
cannot take back the card led.</p>

<p><i><b>19.</b></i> If the dealer takes up the trump to play alone, he must
pass his discard across the table to his partner. If he fails to do
so, the adversaries may insist that his partner play with him, preventing
the lone hand.</p>

<p><i><b>20.</b></i> <i><b>MAKING THE TRUMP.</b></i> If the dealer does not
take up the trump, he must place it under the remainder of the
pack, face upward, so that it can be distinctly seen. Each player in
turn, beginning on the dealer’s left, then has the privilege of naming
a new trump suit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>21.</b></i> If any player names the suit already turned down, he
loses his right to name a suit; and if he corrects himself, and
names another, neither he nor his partner is allowed to make that
suit the trump. If a player names a new trump suit out of his
proper turn, both he and his partner are forbidden to make that
suit the trump.</p>

<p><i><b>22.</b></i> If no one will name a new trump, the deal is void, and
passes to the next player on the dealer’s left.</p>

<p><i><b>23.</b></i> <i><b>IRREGULARITIES IN THE HANDS.</b></i> If
any player is found not to have his correct number of cards, it is a
misdeal; but if he has played to the first trick the deal stands
good, and he cannot score anything that hand.</p>

<p><i><b>24.</b></i> <i><b>EXPOSED CARDS.</b></i> The following are exposed
cards, and must be left face up on the table, and are liable to be
called by the adversaries:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I. Every card faced upon the table otherwise than in
the regular course of play.</p>

<p>II. Two or more cards played to a trick. The adversaries
may elect which shall be played.</p>

<p>III. Any card named by the player holding it.</p>

</div>

<p><i><b>25.</b></i> If an adversary of a person playing alone exposes a card,
the lone player may abandon the hand, and score the points.
Should the partner of the lone player expose a card, the adversaries
may prevent the lone hand by compelling the player in error
to play with his partner, leaving the exposed card on the table.</p>

<p><i><b>26.</b></i> <i><b>CALLING EXPOSED CARDS.</b></i> The adversary
on the right of an exposed card must call it before he plays himself.
If it will be the turn of the player holding the exposed card to lead
for the next trick, the card, if wanted, must be called before the current
trick is turned and quitted. Should a player having an exposed
card and the lead, play from his hand before the previous
trick is turned and quitted, the card so led may also be claimed as
exposed.</p>

<p><i><b>27.</b></i> <i><b>LEADING AND PLAYING OUT OF TURN.</b></i>
If a player leads when it was his partner’s turn, a suit may be called
from his partner. The demand must be made by the last player
to the trick in which the suit is called. If it was the turn of neither
to lead, the card played in error is exposed. If all have played to
the false lead, the error cannot be rectified. If all have not followed,
the cards erroneously played must be taken back, but are
not liable to be called.</p>

<p><i><b>28.</b></i> If an adversary of a lone player leads out of turn, the lone
player may abandon the hand, and score the points.</p>

<p><i><b>29.</b></i> If the third hand plays before the second, the fourth hand
may play before his partner, either of his own volition, or at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
direction of the second hand, who may say: “Play, partner.” If
the fourth hand plays before the second, the third hand may call
upon the second hand to play his highest or lowest of the suit led,
or to trump or not to trump the trick.</p>

<p><i><b>30.</b></i> <i><b>REVOKING.</b></i> A revoke is a renounce in error, not
corrected in time; or non-compliance with a performable penalty.
If a revoke is claimed and proved, the hand in which it occurs is
immediately abandoned. The adversaries of the revoking player
then have the option of adding two points to their own score, or
deducting two points from his score. If both sides revoke, the
deal is void. If one person is playing alone, the penalty for a revoke
is as many points as would have been scored if the lone hand
had succeeded.</p>

<p><i><b>31.</b></i> A revoke may be corrected by the player making it before
the trick in which it occurs has been turned and quitted, unless the
revoking player or his partner, whether in his right turn or otherwise,
has led or played to the following trick.</p>

<p><i><b>32.</b></i> If a player corrects his mistake in time to save a revoke,
the card played in error is exposed; but any cards subsequently
played by others may be taken back without penalty.</p>

<p><i><b>33.</b></i> <i><b>PLAYING ALONE.</b></i> No one but the individual
maker of the trump can play alone.</p>

<p><i><b>34.</b></i> The dealer must announce his intention to play alone by
passing his discard over to his partner. Any other player intending
to play alone must use the expression “alone” in connection
with his ordering up or making the trump; as, “I order it, alone;”
or “I make it hearts, alone.”</p>

<p><i><b>35.</b></i> The partner of a player who has announced to play alone
must lay his cards on the table, face down. Should he expose any
of his cards, the adversaries may prevent the lone hand, and compel
him to play with his partner, the exposed card being left on the
table and liable to be called.</p>

<p><i><b>36.</b></i> The lone player is not liable to any penalty for exposed
cards, nor for a lead out of turn.</p>

<p><i><b>37.</b></i> Should either adversary lead or play out of turn, the lone
player may abandon the hand, and score the points.</p>

<p><i><b>38.</b></i> <i><b>MISCELLANEOUS.</b></i> No player is allowed to see
any trick that has once been turned and quitted, under penalty of
having a suit called from him or his partner.</p>

<p><i><b>39.</b></i> Any player may ask the others to indicate the cards played
by them to the current trick.</p>

<p><i><b>40.</b></i> A player calling attention in any manner to the trick or to
the score, may be called upon to play his highest or lowest of the
suit led; or to trump or not to trump the trick during the play of
which the remark was made.</p>

<h3>ÉCARTÉ.</h3>

<p>Écarté is usually described as a very simple game, but unfortunately
the rules governing it are very complicated, and as no
authoritative code of law exists, disputes about trifling irregularities
are very common. In the following directions the author has
selected what appears to be the best French usage. The code of
laws adopted by some of the English clubs is unfortunately very
defective, and in many respects quite out of touch with the true
spirit of the French game. The English are very fond of penalties;
the French try to establish the status quo.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Écarté is played with a pack of thirty-two cards,
which rank, K Q J A 10 9 8 7. When two packs are used, the adversary
shuffles one while the other is dealt.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKERS.</b></i> In France, the game is always marked with
the ordinary round chips or counters, never with a marker. As
five points is the game, four of these counters are necessary for
each player.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Écarté is played by two persons, who sit opposite
each other. One is known as the dealer, and the other as the
pone, the adversary, the elder hand, the non-dealer, the leader, or
the player.</p>

<p><i><b>THE GALLERY.</b></i> In clubs that make a feature of Écarté,
and in which there is a great deal of betting on the outside by the
spectators, it is not usual to allow more than one game between
the same players, the loser giving place to one of those who have
been backing him, and who is called a <i><b>rentrant</b></i>. This is known
as playing the <i>cul-levé</i>. Any person in the gallery is allowed to
draw attention to errors in the score, and may advise the player he
is backing, or even play out the game for him, if he resigns. The
player need not take the advice given him, which must be offered
without discussion, and by pointing only, not naming the suit or
cards. If a player will not allow the gallery to back him, taking
all bets himself, no one may overlook his hand nor advise him
without his permission, and he need not retire if he loses the
game.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> The player cutting the highest écarté card deals
the first hand, and has the choice of seats and cards. If a person
exposes more than one card in cutting, the lowest is taken to be
his cut. If he does not cut, or will not show his cut, he loses the
first deal.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> Écarté is played for so much a game. If the
gallery is betting, all money offered must be placed on the table,
and if the bets are not taken by the players, they may be covered
by the opposing gallery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> It is usual for the dealer to invite his adversary
to shuffle the cards, but if two packs are used this is not necessary.
The dealer must shuffle the pack and present it to his adversary
to be cut. At least two cards must be left in each packet,
and the upper part of the pack must be placed nearer the dealer.
Five cards are given to each player, and the eleventh is turned up
for the trump. The cards are distributed two and three at a time,
or three and then two, and in whichever manner the dealer begins
he must continue during the game. If he intends to change his
manner of dealing in the following game, he must so advise his
adversary when presenting the cards to be cut.</p>

<p><i><b>MISDEALING.</b></i> A player dealing out of turn, or with the
wrong cards, may be stopped before the trump is turned. But if
the trump has been turned, and neither player has discarded or
played to the first trick, the pack must be set aside, with the cards
as dealt, and the trump turned, to be used for the ensuing deal.
The other pack is then taken up and dealt by the player whose
proper turn it was to deal. If a discard has been made, or a trick
played to, the deal stands good, and the packs, if changed, must so
remain.</p>

<p>There must be a new deal if any card but the eleventh is found
faced in the pack. If the dealer exposes any of his own cards, the
deal stands good. If he exposes any of his adversary’s cards, the
non-dealer may claim a fresh deal, provided he has not seen any
of his cards.</p>

<p>It is a misdeal if the dealer gives too many or too few cards to his
adversary or to himself. If the hands have not been seen, and the
pone discovers that he has received more than five cards, he has
the choice to discard the superfluous cards at hazard, or to claim a
misdeal, which loses the deal. If the pone has received less than
the proper number, he may supply the deficiency from the remainder
of the pack, without changing the trump card, or he may claim a
misdeal. If the dealer has given himself too many or too few
cards, the pone may claim a misdeal, or he may draw the superfluous
cards from the dealer’s hand, face downward, or allow him
to supply the deficiency from the remainder of the pack, without
changing the trump.</p>

<p>If the cards have been seen, the pone, having an incorrect number,
may supply or discard to correct the error, or he may claim a
misdeal. If he discards, he must show the cards to the dealer.
If the dealer has an incorrect number, the pone may draw from
his hand, face downward, looking at the cards he has drawn, (as
the dealer has seen them,) or allow him to supply the deficiency,
or claim a misdeal.</p>

<p>When any irregularity is remedied in this manner, the trump
card remains unchanged.</p>

<p>If the dealer turns up more than one card for the trump, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
adversary has a right to select which card shall be the trump, or he
may claim a new deal by the same dealer, provided he has not
seen his hand. If he has seen his hand, he must either claim a
misdeal, or the eleventh card must be the trump, the other exposed
card being set aside.</p>

<p>If the pack is found to be imperfect, all scores previously made
with it stand good.</p>

<p><i><b>TURNING THE KING.</b></i> If the King is turned up, the
dealer marks one point for it immediately. If a wrong number of
cards has been dealt, and a King is turned, it cannot be scored,
because it was not the eleventh card.</p>

<p><i><b>PROPOSING AND REFUSING.</b></i> The cards dealt,
the pone examines his hand, and if he thinks it strong enough to
win three or more tricks, he stands; that is, plays without proposing,
and says to the dealer: “<i><b>I play</b></i>.” If he thinks he can improve
his chances by drawing cards, allowing the dealer the same
privilege of course, he says: “<i><b>I propose</b></i>;” or simply:
“<i><b>Cards</b></i>.” In reply the dealer may either accept the proposal
by asking: “<i><b>How many?</b></i>” or he may refuse, by saying:
“<i><b>Play</b></i>.” If he gives cards, he may also take cards himself, after
having helped his adversary. If he refuses, he must win at least
three tricks or lose two points; and if the pone plays without proposing,
he must make three tricks, or lose two points. The hands
on which a player should stand, and those on which the dealer
should refuse are known as <i><b>jeux de règle</b></i>, and will be found in
the suggestions for good play.</p>

<p>A proposal, acceptance, or refusal once made cannot be changed
or taken back, and the number of cards asked for cannot be corrected.</p>

<p><i><b>DISCARDING.</b></i> If the pone proposes, and the dealer asks:
“How many?” the elder hand discards any number of cards from
one to five, placing them on his right. These discards, once
quitted, must not again be looked at. A player looking at his own
or his adversary’s discards can be called upon to play with his
cards exposed face upward on the table, but not liable to be called.
The number of cards discarded must be distinctly announced, and
the trump is then laid aside, and the cards given from the top of
the pack, without further shuffling. It is considered imperative
that the player who has proposed should take at least one card, even
if he proposed with five trumps in his hand. The pone helped,
the dealer then announces how many cards he takes, placing his
discards on his left. The dealer, if asked, must inform his adversary
how many cards he took, provided the question is put before
he plays a card.</p>

<p>After receiving his cards, the pone may either stand or propose
again, and the dealer may either give or refuse; but such subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
stands or refusals do not carry with them any penalty for
failure to make three tricks. Should these repeated discards exhaust
the pack, so that there are not enough cards left to supply the
number asked for, the players must take back a sufficient number
from their discards. If the dealer has accepted a proposal, and finds
there are no cards left for himself, that is his own fault; he should
have counted the pack before accepting. The trump card cannot
be taken into the hand under any circumstances.</p>

<p><i><b>MISDEALING AFTER DISCARDING.</b></i> If the
dealer gives the pone more or less cards than he asks for, he loses
the point and the right to mark the King, unless it was turned up.</p>

<p>If the dealer gives himself more cards than he wants, he loses
the point and the right to mark the King, unless he turned it up.
If he gives himself less cards than he wants, he may make the deficiency
good without penalty; but if he does not discover the
error until he has played a card, all tricks for which he has no
card to play must be considered as won by his adversary.</p>

<p>If the pone asks for more cards than he wants, the dealer can
play the hand or not, as he pleases. If he plays, he may draw the
superfluous card or cards given to the pone, and look at them if
the pone has seen them. If the dealer decides not to play, he
marks the point. In either case the pone cannot mark the King,
even if he holds it.</p>

<p>If the pone asks for less cards than he wants, he must play the
hand as it is, and can mark the King if he holds it; but all tricks
for which he has no card to play must be considered as won by his
adversary.</p>

<p>If a player plays without discarding, or discards for the purpose
of exchanging, without advising his adversary of the fact that
he has too many or too few cards, he loses two points, and the
right of marking the King, even if turned up.</p>

<p>If either player, after discarding and drawing, plays with more
than five cards, he loses the point and the privilege of marking the
King.</p>

<p>Should the dealer forget himself in dealing for the discard, and
turn up another trump, he cannot refuse his adversary another
discard, if he demands it, and the exposed card must be put aside
with the discards.</p>

<p>If any cards are found faced in the pack when dealing for the
discard, the deal stands good if they will fall to the dealer. But
if the exposed card will go to the pone, he has the option of taking
it, or claiming a fresh deal by the same dealer.</p>

<p>During all the discards the trump card remains the same.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKING THE KING.</b></i> The discards settled, the first
and most important thing before play begins is to mark the King.
If the King is turned up, the dealer marks one point for it immediately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
If the pone holds it, he must <i><b>announce</b></i> and mark it
before he plays a card. If he leads the King for the first trick, he
must still announce it by saying distinctly: “I mark the King;”
and unless this announcement is made before the King touches
the table, it cannot be marked. So important is this rule that in
some European Casinos it is found printed on the card tables.
Having properly announced the King, it may be actually marked
with the counters at any time before the trump is turned for the
following game.</p>

<p>If the dealer holds the King he must announce it before his
adversary leads for the first trick. It is in order that there may
be no surprises in this respect that the elder hand is required to
say distinctly: “I play,” before he leads a card. The dealer
must then reply: “I mark the King,” if he has it; if not, he
should say: “Play.” A player is not compelled to announce or
mark the King if he does not choose to do so.</p>

<p>If a player announces and marks the King when he does not
hold it, his adversary can take down the point erroneously marked,
and mark one himself, for penalty. This does not prevent him
from marking an additional point for the King if he holds it himself.
For instance: The pone announces King, and marks it, at
the same time leading a card. Not having notified the dealer that
he was about to play, the dealer cannot be deprived of his right to
mark the King himself, if he holds it. The dealer marks the
King, marks another point for penalty, and takes down the pone’s
point, erroneously marked. If the player announcing the King
without holding it, discovers his error before a card is played, he
simply amends the score and apologizes, and there is no penalty.
If any cards have been played after an erroneous announcement
of the King, such cards can be taken back by the adversary of the
player in error, and the hand played over again.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The elder hand begins by
leading any card he pleases, at the same time announcing the suit;
“hearts;” “spades;” or whatever it may be. This announcement
must be continued at every trick. If a player announces one suit
and leads another, his adversary may demand that he take back
the card played, and lead the suit announced. If he has none of
the announced suit, the adversary may call a suit. If the adversary
is satisfied with the card led, but improperly announced, he
may demand that it remain as played.</p>

<p><i><b>RENOUNCING.</b></i> When a card is led the adversary must
not only follow suit, but must win the trick if he can. If he can
neither follow suit nor trump, he may discard any card he pleases.
Should a player not follow suit, or should he decline to win the
trick, when able to do so, it is a renounce, and if he makes the odd
trick he counts nothing; if he makes all five tricks, he counts one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
point only, instead of two. Should he trump the trick when he can
follow suit, he is subject to the same penalty. There is no such
thing as a <i><b>revoke</b></i> in Ecarté. When it is discovered that a player
has not followed suit when able, or has lost a trick that he could
have won, the cards are taken back, and the hand played over
again, with the foregoing penalty for the renounce.</p>

<p>The highest card played, if of the suit led, wins the trick, and
trumps win all other suits.</p>

<p><i><b>Leading Out of Turn.</b></i> Should a player lead out of turn, he
may take back the card without penalty. If the adversary has
played to the erroneous lead, the trick stands good.</p>

<p><i><b>Gathering Tricks.</b></i> The tricks must be turned down as
taken in, and any player looking at a trick once turned and quitted
may be called upon to play with the remainder of his hand exposed,
but not liable to be called.</p>

<p><i><b>Abandoned Hands.</b></i> If, after taking one or more tricks, a
player throws his cards upon the table, he loses the point; if he
has not taken a trick, he loses two points. But if the cards are
thrown down claiming the point or the game, and the claim is
good, there is no penalty. If the cards are abandoned with the
admission that the adversary wins the point or the game, and the
adversary cannot win more than is admitted, there is no penalty.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> A game consists of five points, which are made
by tricks, by penalties, and by marking the King. A player winning
three tricks out of the five possible, counts one point toward
game; winning all five tricks, which is called <i><b>the vole</b></i>, counts
two points. The player holding or turning up the King of trumps
may mark one point for it, but he is not compelled to do so.</p>

<p>If the pone plays without proposing, and makes three or four
tricks, he counts one point; if he makes the vole he counts two
points; but if he fails to make three tricks the dealer counts two.</p>

<p>If the dealer refuses the first proposal, he must make three tricks
to count one point; if he makes the vole he counts two points; but
if he fails to win three tricks the player who was refused counts
two points.</p>

<p>If the dealer accepts the first proposal, and gives cards, subsequent
proposals and refusals do not affect the score; the winner of
the odd trick scoring one point, and the winner of the vole two
points.</p>

<p>In no case can a player make more than two points in one hand
by tricks. If the dealer refuses the first proposal, and the pone
makes the vole, it counts two points only. If the pone should play
without proposing, and the dealer should mark the King and win
the vole, it would count him only three points altogether.</p>

<p>The player first reaching five points wins the game. If a
player has four scored, and turns the King, that wins the game,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
provided the King was the eleventh card. Rubbers are seldom
played.</p>

<p><i><b>CHEATING.</b></i> The methods of cheating at Écarté would fill
a volume. There are many tricks which, while not exactly fraudulent,
are certainly questionable. For instance: A player asks the
gallery whether or not he should stand, and finally concludes to
propose, fully intending all the time to draw five cards. Another
will handle his counters as if about to mark the King; will then affect
to hesitate, and finally re-adjust them, and ask for cards,
probably taking four or five, having absolutely nothing in his hand.
The pone will ask the dealer how many points he has marked,
knowing perfectly well that the number is three. On being so informed,
he concludes to ask for cards, as if he were not quite
strong enough to risk the game by standing; when as a matter of
fact he wants five cards, and is afraid of the vole being made
against him.</p>

<p>There are many simple little tricks practiced by the would-be
sharper, such as watching how many cards a player habitually cuts,
and then getting the four Kings close together in such a position in
the pack that one of them is almost certain to be turned. Telegraphic
signals between persons on opposite sides of the gallery
who are nevertheless in partnership, are often translated into advice
to the player, to his great benefit. Besides these, all the machinery
of marked cards, reflectors, shifted cuts, wedges, strippers,
and false shuffles are at the command of the philosopher, who can
always handle a small pack of cards with greater freedom, and to
whom the fashion of dealing in twos and threes is always welcome.
The honest card-player has not one chance in a thousand against
the professional at Écarté.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> The French
claim that any person may become an expert at a game like Piquet,
simply by dint of long practice; but that the master of Écarté
must be a born card-player, as no game requires in such degree
the exercise of individual intelligence and finesse. While this may
be true, there are many points about the game which may be
learned by the novice, and which will greatly improve his play.</p>

<p>There are two things which the beginner should master before
sitting down to the table for actual play: the hands on which it is
right to stand, or play without proposing, and those with which it
is right to refuse, or play without giving cards. These are called
stand hands, or <i><b>jeux de règle</b></i>, and the player should be able
to recognize them on sight.</p>

<p>In the following paragraphs the words <i><b>dealer</b></i> and <i><b>player</b></i>
will be used to distinguish the adversaries at Écarté.</p>

<p>The principle underlying the jeux de règle is the probable distribution
of the cards in the trump suit, and the fact that the odds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
are always against the dealer’s holding two or more. There are
thirty-two cards in the Écarté pack, of which eight are trumps, and
one of these is always turned up. The turn-up and the player’s
hand give us six cards which are known, and leave twenty-six unknown.
Of these unknown cards the dealer holds five, and he
may get these five in 65,780 different ways. The theory of the
jeux de règle is that there are only a certain number of those ways
which will give him two or more trumps. If the player holds one
trump, the odds against the dealer’s holding two or more are
44,574 to 21,206; or a little more than 2 to 1. If the player holds
two trumps, the odds against the dealer’s holding two or more are
50,274 to 15,506; or more than 3 to 1. It is therefore evident that
any hand which is certain to win three tricks if the dealer has not
two trumps, has odds of two to one in its favour, and all such
hands are called jeux de règle. The natural inference from this is
that such hands should always be played without proposing, unless
they contain the King of trumps.</p>

<p>The exception in case of holding the King is made because there
is no danger of the dealer’s getting the King, no matter how many
cards he draws, and if the player’s cards are not strong enough to
make it probable that he can win the vole, it is better for him to
ask for cards, in hope of improving his chances. If he is refused,
he stands an excellent chance to make two points by winning the
odd trick.</p>

<p>While it is the rule for the player to stand when the odds are
two to one in his favour for making the odd trick, and to ask for
cards when the odds are less, there are exceptions. The chances
of improving by taking in cards must not be forgotten, and it must
be remembered that the player who proposes runs no risk of penalty.
He has also the advantage of scoring two for the vole if he
can get cards enough to win every trick, whereas the dealer gets
no more for the vole than for the odd trick if the player does not
propose. Some beginners have a bad habit of asking for cards if
they are pretty certain of the point. Unless they hold the King
this is not wise, for the player cannot discard more than one or
two cards, but the dealer may take five, and then stands a fair
chance of getting the King, which would not only count a point
for him, but would effectually stop the vole for which the player
was drawing cards.</p>

<p>The most obvious example of a jeux de règle is one trump, a
winning sequence of three cards in one suit, and a small card in
another. For instance: Hearts trumps&mdash;</p>

<p>If the dealer does not hold two trumps, it is impossible to prevent
the player from winning the point with these cards; because
he need only lead his winning sequence until it is trumped, and
then trump himself in again. With this hand the player will win
44,724 times out of 65,780.</p>

<p>There are about twenty hands which are generally known as
jeux de règle, and every écarté player should be familiar with
them. In the following examples the weakest hands are given,
and the trumps are always the smallest possible. If the player
has more strength in plain suits than is shown in these examples,
or higher trumps, there is so much more reason for him to stand.
But if he has not the strength indicated in plain suits, he should
propose, even if his trumps are higher, because it must be remembered
that strong trumps do not compensate for weakness in plain
suits. The reason for this is that from stand hands trumps
should never be led unless there are three of them; they are to be
kept for ruffing, and when you have to ruff it does not matter
whether you use a seven or a Queen. The King of trumps is of
course led; but a player does not stand on a hand containing the
King.</p>

<p>The first suit given is always the trump, and the next suit is always
the one that should be led, beginning with the best card of
it if there is more than one. The figures on the right show the
number of hands in which the player or the dealer will win out of
the 65,780 possible distributions of the twenty-six unknown cards.
These calculations are taken, by permission of Mr. Charles Mossop,
from the eighth volume of the “<i>Westminster Papers</i>,” in which
all the variations and their results are given in full.</p>

<p><i><b>THE LEADER.</b></i> There are a great many more opportunities
to make the vole than most players are aware of; especially
with jeux de règle. Where the vole is improbable or impossible,
tenace is very important, and all tenace positions should be made
the most of. In No. 5, for instance, if the clubs were the Queen
and ace, it would be better to begin with the heart King, instead
of leading away from the minor tenace in clubs. Observe the
lead in No. 4. Many tenace positions cannot be taken advantage
of because the player must win the trick if he can. For instance:
Several discards have been made, and each player suspects the
other holds three trumps, with three tricks to play. The Queen is
led, and the adversary holds K A 7. If he could pass this trick,
he must lie tenace; but as he has to win it with the King, he gives
tenace to his adversary, who evidently has J and another.</p>

<p>When the dealer is four, the player may stand on much weaker
hands.</p>

<p>It is usually best to lead from guarded suits, in preference to
single cards. Lead the best of a suit if you have it. If the third
trick is the first you win, and you have a trump and another card,
lead the trump; but if you have won two tricks, lead the plain suit.</p>

<p><i><b>THE DEALER.</b></i> When the player asks for cards, the
dealer knows that his adversary probably does not hold a jeux de
règle. The dealer must not be too sure of this, however, for proposals
are sometimes made on very strong hands in order to try
for the vole, or to make two points on the refusal. The dealer
should assume that he is opposed by the best play until he finds
the contrary to be the case, and it is safest to play on the assumption
that a player who proposes has not a jeux de règle.</p>

<p>For all practical purposes it may be said that the dealer can refuse
to give cards with hands a trifle less strong than those on
which the player would stand. The general rule is for the dealer
to give cards unless he is guarded in three suits; or has a trump,
and is safe in two suits; or has two trumps, and is safe in one
suit. If the dealer has only one suit guarded, and one trump, he
must take into account the risk of being forced, and having to lead
away from his guarded suit.</p>

<p>There are eight recognized hands on which the dealer should refuse.
The full details of the calculations can be found in the
ninth volume of the “<i>Westminster Papers</i>.” As in the case of
the player, the weakest trumps have been taken for the examples,
and the weakest holdings in plain suits. If the dealer has
better plain suits, or stronger trumps, he has of course so much
more in his favour if he refuses. The first column of figures gives
the number of times in 65,780 that there will be no proposal, so
that the dealer has no choice but to play. The other columns
give the number of times the dealer or the player will win if the
player proposes and the dealer refuses.</p>

<p>In giving cards, some judgment of human nature is necessary.
Some players habitually propose on strong hands, and it is best to
give to such pretty freely.</p>

<p><i><b>DISCARDING.</b></i> The general principle of discarding is to
keep trumps and Kings, and let everything else go. If you hold
the trump King you may discard freely in order to strengthen
your hand for a possible vole. If you have proposed once, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
hold the King, and feel pretty sure of the point, you may propose
again on the chance of getting strength enough to make the vole.</p>

<p>When only two cards can be discarded, it is a safe rule to stand
on the hand; either to play without proposing, or to refuse cards;
unless you hold the King.</p>

<p>There are no authoritative laws for Écarté, and the various
French and English codes do not agree. The code adopted by
the English clubs is not in accord with the best usage, and fails to
provide for many contingencies. All that is essential in the laws
will be found embodied in the foregoing description of the game.</p>

<p><i><b>TEXT BOOKS.</b></i> The best works on the subject of Écarté
are usually to be found in conjunction with other games. The
student will find the following useful:&mdash;</p>

<h3>POOL ÉCARTÉ.</h3>

<p>Pool Écarté is played by three persons, each of whom contributes
an agreed sum, which is called a <i><b>stake</b></i>, to form a pool.
They then cut to decide which shall play the first game, the lowest
écarté card going out. The players then cut for the first deal,
choice of seats and cards, etc., exactly as in the ordinary game.</p>

<p>The winner of the first game retains his seat; the loser pays into
the pool another stake, equal to the first, and retires in favour of
the third player, who is called the <i><b>rentrant</b></i>. The rentrant takes
the loser’s seat and cards, and cuts with the successful player for
the first deal. The loser of the second game adds another stake
to the pool, and retires in favour of the waiting player.</p>

<p>The pool is won by any player winning two games in succession.
If the winner of the first game won the second also, he would
take the pool, which would then contain five stakes; the three
originally deposited, and the two added by the losers of the two
games. A new pool would then be formed by each of the three
depositing another stake, and all cutting to decide which should
sit out for the first game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>In some places only the two players actually engaged contribute
to the pool, the loser retiring without paying anything further,
and the rentrant contributing his stake when he takes the loser’s
place.</p>

<p>The outsider is not allowed to advise either player during the
first game, nor to call attention to the score; but on the second
game he is allowed to advise the player who has taken his seat
and cards. This is on the principle that he has no right to choose
sides on the first game; but that after that he has an interest in
preventing his former adversary from winning the second game,
so as to preserve the pool until he can play for it again himself.</p>

<h3>NAPOLEON, OR NAP.</h3>

<p>This is one of the simplest, and at the same time most popular
of the euchre family. Few games have become so widely known
in such a short time, or have had such a vogue among all classes
of society. So far as the mere winning and losing goes, the result
depends largely upon luck, and skill is of small importance. Except
in a long series of games the average player has little to fear
from the most expert.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Napoleon is played with a full pack of fifty-two
cards, which rank A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2; the ace being
highest in play; but ranking below the deuce in cutting.</p>

<p><i><b>COUNTERS.</b></i> As each deal is a complete game in itself it
must be settled for in counters, to which some value is usually
attached. One player is selected for the banker, and before play
begins each of the others purchases from him a certain number of
counters, usually fifty. When any player’s supply is exhausted,
he can purchase more, either from the banker or from another
player.</p>

<p>In many places counters are not used, and the value of the
game is designated by the coins that take their place. In “penny
nap,” English coppers are used in settling; sixpences in “sixpenny
nap,” and so on. In America, nickel and quarter nap are the
usual forms.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Any number from two to six can play; but
four is the best game. If five or six play it is usual for the dealer
to give himself no cards.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> The players draw from an outspread pack to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
form the table, and for choice of seats. A lower cut gives preference
over all higher; the lowest cut has the first choice of seats,
and deals the first hand. Ties cut again, but the new cut decides
nothing but the tie.</p>

<p>In some places the players take their seats at random, and a
card is then dealt to each face upward; the lowest card or the
first Jack taking the deal.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> Any player has a right to shuffle the cards, the
dealer last. They are then presented to the pone to be cut, and
at least four cards must be left in each packet. Beginning at his
left, the dealer gives each <i>player</i> in rotation two cards on the first
round, and three on the next; or three on the first and two on
the next. No trump is turned. In some places the cards are distributed
one at a time until each player has five; but the plan is
not popular, as the hands run better and the bidding is livelier
when the cards are dealt in twos and threes. The deal passes
to the left, each player dealing in turn.</p>

<p><i><b>MISDEALING.</b></i> A misdeal does not lose the deal in Napoleon,
because the deal is a disadvantage. For this reason, if
any player begins to deal out of turn, he must finish, and the deal
stands good. If any card is found faced in the pack, or is exposed
by the dealer; or if too many or too few cards are given to any
player; or if the dealer does not give the same number of cards to
each player in the same round; or if he fails to have the pack cut,
it is a misdeal, and the misdealer must deal again with the same
pack.</p>

<p><i><b>BIDDING.</b></i> Beginning on the dealer’s left, each player in
turn bids for the privilege of naming the trump suit, stating the
number of tricks he proposes to win, playing single-handed against
the three other players, and leading a trump for the first trick. In
bidding, the trump suit is not named, only the number of tricks.
If a player proposes to win all five tricks he bids <i><b>nap</b></i>, which is
the highest bid possible, and precludes any further bidding, except
in some of the variations which will be described later on.
If a player will not make a bid, he says “<i><b>I pass</b></i>,” A bid having
been made, any following player must either increase it or pass.
If all pass until it comes to the dealer, he is bound to bid at least
one trick, and either play or pay. The hands are never abandoned
except in case of a misdeal.</p>

<p>In some places a <i><b>misère</b></i> bid is allowed, which outranks a bid
of three tricks, and is beaten by one of four. There is no trump
suit in misère, but the bidder, if successful, must lead for the first
trick.</p>

<p>Any bid once made can neither be amended nor recalled, and
there is no second bid.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The player bidding the highest
number of tricks has the first lead, and the first card he plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
must be one of the trump suit. The players must follow suit
if able, but need not win the trick unless they choose to do so.
The highest card played of the suit led wins the trick, and trumps
win all other suits. The winner of the trick leads again for the
next trick, and so on, until all five tricks have been played. After
the first trick any suit may be led.</p>

<p>The bidder gathers all tricks he wins, stacking them so that they
may be readily counted by any player at the table. One of the
other side should gather all tricks won by the adversaries of the
bidder. A trick once turned and quitted cannot again be seen.
In some places they have a very bad habit of gathering tricks with
the cards face up, turning down one card only. This always
results in numerous misdeals, on account of cards being continually
found faced in the pack.</p>

<p>The hands are usually abandoned when the bidder succeeds in
his undertaking, or shows cards which are good for his bid against
any play. If it is impossible for him to succeed, as when he bids
four and the adversaries have won two tricks, the hands are thrown
up, because nothing is paid for under or over-tricks. Players
should show the remainder of their hands to the board, as evidence
that no revoke has been made.</p>

<p><i><b>IRREGULARITIES IN HANDS.</b></i> If a player, before
he makes a bid or passes, discovers that he holds too many or too
few cards, he must immediately claim a misdeal. If he has either
made a bid or passed, the deal stands good, and the hand must be
played out. If the bidder has his right number of cards and succeeds,
he must be paid. If he fails, he neither wins nor loses;
because he is playing against a foul hand. If the bidder has more
than his right number of cards he must pay if he loses; but wins
nothing if he succeeds. If he has less than his right number of
cards, he is simply supposed to have lost the trick for which he
has no card to play.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYING OUT OF TURN.</b></i> If any adversary of the
bidder leads or plays out of turn, he forfeits three counters to the
bidder, independently of the result of the hand, and receives nothing
if the bid is defeated. If the bidder leads out of turn, the card
must be taken back, unless all have followed the erroneous lead,
in which case the trick is good. There is no penalty if he plays
out of turn.</p>

<p><i><b>REVOKES.</b></i> When a revoke is detected and claimed, the
hands are immediately abandoned, and the individual player in
fault must pay all the counters depending on the result. If he is
the bidder, he pays each adversary; if he is opposed to the bidder,
he pays for himself and for each of his partners. In England it is
the rule to take back the cards and play the hand over again, as
at Écarté, the revoking player paying all the stakes according to
the result. This is often very unfair to the bidder, and leads to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
endless disputes as to who held certain cards which have been
gathered into tricks. Sometimes the difference between a seven
and an eight in a certain player’s hand will change the entire
result.</p>

<p><i><b>PAYMENTS.</b></i> If the bidder succeeds in winning the specified
number of tricks, each adversary pays him a counter for every
trick bid. If he bid three tricks, they pay him three counters
each; four counters each for four tricks bid; and the value of
three tricks for a misère. If he fails to win the specified number
of tricks, he pays each adversary; three counters if he bid three
tricks, or a misère; four if he bid four. Any player bidding nap,
and succeeding in winning all five tricks, receives ten counters
from each adversary; but if he fails, he pays only five to each.</p>

<p>When penny nap is played, the settlement being in coin, it is
usual to make naps win a shilling or lose sixpence, in order to
avoid handling so much copper.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> In calculating
his chances for success in winning a certain number of tricks, the
player will often have to take into consideration the probability of
certain cards being out against him. This will vary according to
the number of players engaged. For instance: If four are playing,
and the bidder holds K Q of a plain suit, the odds against the
ace of that suit being out against him are about 2 to 1. As it
would be impossible for any person to remember all the jeux de
règle for three tricks at Napoleon, each must learn from experience
the trick-taking value of certain hands. Trump strength is,
of course, the great factor, and the bidder should count on finding
at least two trumps in one hand against him. Nap should never
be bid on a hand which is not pretty sure of winning two rounds
of trumps, with all other cards but one winners. One trick may
always be risked in a nap hand, such as A Q of trumps, or a King,
or even a Queen or Jack in a plain suit; the odds against the adversaries
having a better card being slightly increased by the odds
against their knowing enough to keep it for the last trick.</p>

<p>If the bid is for three tricks only, tenaces, or guarded minor
honours in plain suits should be preserved. After the first trick it
will sometimes be advantageous for the player to get rid of any
losing card he may have in plain suits. It is seldom right to continue
the trumps if the bidder held only two originally, unless he
has winning cards in two plain suits, in which case it may be better
to lead even a losing trump to prevent a possibility of adverse
trumps making separately.</p>

<p>In playing against the bidder, leave no trick to your partners
that you can win yourself, unless a small card is led, and you
have the ace. In opening fresh suits do not lead guarded honours,
but prefer aces or singletons. If the caller needs only one
more trick, it is usually best to lead a trump. If you have three
trumps, including the major tenace, pass the first trick if a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
trump is led; or if you remain with the tenace after the first trick,
be careful to avoid the lead.</p>

<p>Discards should indicate weakness, unless you can show command
of such a suit as A K, or K Q, by discarding the best of it.
This will direct your partners to let that suit go, and keep the
others. It is usually better to keep a guarded King than a single
ace. The player on the right of the bidder should get into the
lead if possible, especially if he holds one or two winning cards.
These will either give his partners discards, or allow them to over-trump
the bidder.</p>

<p>In playing misères, it is better to begin with a singleton, or the
lowest of a safe suit. An ace or King two or three times guarded
is very safe for a misère, as it is very improbable that any player
will be able to lead the suit more than twice; and if the bidder’s
missing suit is led, the high card can be got rid of at once.</p>

<p>In playing against a misère, discards are important, and the first
should be from the shortest suit, and always the highest card of it.
A suit in which the bidder is long should be continued, in order to
give partners discards. More money is lost at Napoleon by playing
imperfect misères than in any other way.</p>

<p><i><b>Variations.</b></i> The foregoing description applies to the regular
four-handed game; but there are several variations in common
use.</p>

<p>Better bids than “nap” are sometimes allowed, on the understanding
that the bidder will pay double or treble stakes if he fails,
but will receive only the usual amount if successful. For instance:
One player bids <i><b>Nap</b></i>, and another holds what he considers a certainty
for five tricks. In order not to lose such an opportunity the
latter bids <i><b>Wellington</b></i>, which binds him to pay ten counters to
each player if he fails. Another may outbid this again by bidding
<i><b>Blucher</b></i>, which binds him to pay twenty to each if he loses, but
to receive only ten if he wins. In England, the bidder, if successful,
receives double or treble stakes for a Wellington or a Blucher,
which is simply another way of allowing any person with a nap
hand to increase the stakes at pleasure, for a player with a certain
five tricks would of course bid a Blucher at once, trebling
his gains and shutting off all competition at the same time. This
variation is not to be recommended, and benefits no one but the
gambler.</p>

<p><i><b>Pools.</b></i> Napoleon is sometimes played with a pool, each player
contributing a certain amount, usually two counters, on the first
deal. Each dealer in turn adds two more; revokes pay five, and
leads out of turn three. The player who first succeeds in winning
five tricks on a nap bid takes the pool, and a fresh one is formed.
If a player bids nap and fails, he is usually called upon to double
the amount then in the pool, besides paying his adversaries.</p>

<p><i><b>Purchase Nap</b></i>; sometimes called <i><b>Écarté Nap</b></i>, is a variation
of the pool game. After the cards are dealt, and before any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
bids are made, each player in turn, beginning on the dealer’s left,
may discard as many cards as he pleases, the dealer giving him
others in their place. For each card so exchanged, the player pays
one counter to the pool. Only one round of exchanges is allowed,
and bids are then in order. A player having once refused to buy,
or having named the number of cards he wishes to exchange, cannot
amend his decision. Any player winning five tricks on a nap
bid takes the entire pool. This is a very good game, and increases
both the bids and the play against them.</p>

<p><i><b>Widows.</b></i> Another variation is to deal five cards in the centre
of the table, face downward, the dealer giving the cards to the
widow just before helping himself in each round. Any player in
his proper turn to bid may take the widow, and from the total of
ten cards so obtained select five on which he must bid nap, discarding
the others face downward.</p>

<p><i><b>Peep Nap.</b></i> In this variety of the pool game one card only is
dealt to the widow, usually on the first round. Each player in
turn, before bidding or passing, has the privilege of taking a private
peep at this down card, on paying one counter to the pool.
The card is left on the table until the highest bidder is known, and
he then takes it into his hand, whether he has paid to peep at it or
not. He must then discard to reduce his hand to five cards. If a
player bids nap it usually pays those following him to have a peep
at the down card in case the bidder should retain it in his hand.</p>

<h3>SPOIL FIVE.</h3>

<p>Spoil Five is one of the oldest of card games, and is generally
conceded to be the national game of Ireland. It is derived from
the still older game of Maw, which was the favourite recreation of
James the First. The connecting link seems to have been a game
called Five Fingers, which is described in the “<i>Compleat Gamester</i>,”
first published in 1674. The Five Fingers was the five of
trumps, and also the best, the ace of hearts coming next. In Spoil
Five, the Jack of trumps comes between these two.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Spoil Five is played with a full pack of fifty-two
cards. The rank of the cards varies according to the colour of the
suit, and the trump suit undergoes still further changes, the heart
ace being always the third best trump. In the plain suits, the
K Q J retain their usual order, the King being the best. The rank
of the spot cards, including the aces of diamonds, clubs, and
spades, is generally expressed by the phrase: <i><b>Highest in red;
lowest in black</b></i>. That is to say, if several cards of a suit, not
including a King, Queen or Jack, are played to a trick, the highest
card will win if the suit is red; and the lowest if the suit is black.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
This will give us the following order for the plain suits, beginning
with the highest card in each:&mdash;</p>

that four cards are always the best trumps. These are the Five,
Jack, and ace of the suit itself, and the ace of hearts, the latter being

<p><i><b>COUNTERS.</b></i> Spoil Five is played with a pool, for which
counters are necessary. One player should act as banker, and the
others should purchase from him, each beginning with 20 counters.
Coins may take the place of counters, shillings being the usual
points.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Any number from 2 to 10 may play; but 5 or 6
is the usual game.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> This is unknown at Spoil Five. The players
take their seats at random, and one of them deals a card face up
to each in succession. The first Jack takes the first deal. Some
note should be made of the player who gets the first deal, as the
rules require that when the game is brought to an end the last
deal shall be made by the player on the right of the first dealer.</p>

<p><i><b>THE POOL.</b></i> Before play begins each player deposits one
counter in the pool, and to this amount each successive dealer
adds a counter until the pool is won, when all contribute equally
to form a new one. In some places it is the practice for each successive
dealer to put up for all the players, whether the pool is won
or not. This simply makes larger pools.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> Any player has the right to shuffle the pack,
the dealer last. The cards are then presented to the pone to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
cut, and as many cards as there are players must be left in each
packet. Beginning on his left, the dealer gives five cards to each
player; two on the first round and three on the next, or three and
then two. After all are helped, the next card is turned up on the
remainder of the pack, and the suit to which it belongs is the
trump for that deal.</p>

<p><i><b>MISDEALING.</b></i> If there is any irregularity in the deal
which is not the dealer’s fault, such as any card except the trump
found faced in the pack, or the pack found imperfect, the same person
deals again. But if the dealer neglects to have the pack cut,
or deals too many or too few cards to any player, or exposes a
card in dealing, or does not give the same number of cards to
each player on the same round, or counts the cards on the table
or those remaining in the pack, it is a misdeal, and the deal passes
to the next player on the misdealer’s left. In some places the misdealer
is allowed to deal again if he forfeits two counters to the
pool.</p>

<p><i><b>ROBBING THE TRUMP CARD.</b></i> If the trump card
is an ace, the dealer may discard any card he pleases in exchange
for it. He may take up the ace when he plays to the first trick,
or may leave it on the pack until got rid of in the course of play.
When an ace is turned, the eldest hand, before leading, should
call upon the dealer to discard if he has not already done so. If
the dealer does not want the trump, he answers: “I play these.”</p>

<p>If the trump card is not an ace, any player at the table holding
the ace of trumps is bound to announce the fact when it comes
to his turn to play to the first trick. The usual plan is for him to
pass a card to the dealer face downward, and in return the dealer
will give him the turn-up trump. If the holder of the ace does
not want the turn-up, he must tell the dealer to turn the trump
down, which shows that he could rob, but does not wish to. If
the holder of the ace of trumps plays without announcing it, he
not only loses his right to rob, but his ace of trumps becomes of
less value than any other trump for that deal, and even if it is the
ace of hearts he loses the privileges attached to that card.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The eldest hand begins by
leading any card he pleases. It is not necessary to follow suit except
in trumps; but if a player does not follow suit when he is able
to do so, he must trump the trick, or it is a revoke. If he cannot
follow suit, he may trump or discard at his pleasure. The highest
card played of the suit led wins the trick, and trumps win all other
suits. The winner of the first trick leads any card he pleases for
the next, and so on, until all five tricks have been played. Each
player gathers his own tricks, as there are no partnerships.</p>

<p><i><b>RENEGING.</b></i> The three highest trumps have special privileges
in the matter of not following suit. Any player holding the
Five or Jack of the trump suit; or the ace of hearts, but having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
no smaller trump with them, may refuse to follow suit if any inferior
trump is led; but if he has also a smaller trump, he must
play one or the other. If a superior trump is led, the player must
follow suit in any case. For instance: If the Five of trumps is
led, no one can refuse to follow suit, no matter what trumps he
holds; but if the Jack is led, and any player holds the Five alone,
he need not play it to the inferior trump lead. If the heart ace is
led, and one player holds the Jack alone, and another the Five
alone, neither of these cards need be played, because the trump
led is inferior to both of them. If a superior trump is played in
following suit, such as the Five played on an Eight led, the holder
of the lone Jack of trumps or ace of hearts, need not play it, because
the lead was inferior. This privilege of reneging is confined
to the three highest trumps.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> In Spoil Five there are
three things to play for. If any one person can win three tricks
he takes the pool. If he can win all five tricks he not only gets
the pool, but receives an extra counter from each of the other
players. If he has no chance to win three tricks, he must bend
all his energies to scattering the tricks among the other players, so
that no one of them shall be able to get the three tricks necessary
to win the pool. When this is done, the game is said to be
<i><b>spoiled</b></i>, and as that is the object of the majority in every deal
it gives the game its name. In the older forms of the game the
winner of three tricks counted five points, and if he could be prevented
from getting three tricks his five points were spoiled.</p>

<p><i><b>JINK GAME.</b></i> When a player has won three tricks, he
should immediately abandon his hand and claim the pool, for if he
continues playing he must <i><b>jink it</b></i>, and get all five tricks or lose
what he has already won, the game being spoiled just as if no one
had won three tricks. It is sometimes a matter for nice judgment
whether or not to go on, and, for the sake of an extra counter
from each player, to risk a pool already won. The best trump is
often held up for three rounds to coax a player to go on in this
manner.</p>

<p><i><b>IRREGULARITIES IN THE HANDS.</b></i> If, during
the play of a hand, it is discovered that any one holds too many
or too few cards, that hand is foul, and must be abandoned, the
holder forfeiting all right to the pool for that deal. Those who
have their right number of cards finish the play without the foul
hand, but any tricks already won by the holder of the foul hand
remain his property.</p>

<p><i><b>IRREGULARITIES IN PLAY.</b></i> If any player robs
when he does not hold the ace; leads or plays out of turn;
reneges to the lead of a higher trump; renounces in the trump
suit; revokes in a plain suit; or exposes a card after any player
has won two tricks, he loses all his right and interest in the current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
pool, which he cannot win, either on that or any subsequent
deal, but to which he must continue to contribute when it comes
to his turn to deal. After the pool has been won, and a fresh one
formed, the penalty is removed.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> Observation,
quickness, and good judgment of character are the essentials for
success at Spoil Five, the last being probably the most important.
The peculiar order of the cards; the privilege of renouncing when
holding a card of the suit led; and the right of passing inferior
trump leads, are very confusing to the beginner; but with practice
the routine and strategy of the game soon become familiar.</p>

<p>The player should first make up his mind whether he is going to
try to win the pool or to spoil it. Particular attention should be
paid to the player who robs, because he must have at least the ace
and the turn-up in trumps, and is more likely to need spoiling than
any other player. When a player wins a trick, some judgment
will be necessary to decide whether he is trying for the pool himself,
or simply spoiling it for some one else. When he wins two
tricks, every other player at the table must combine against him.</p>

<p>With only one small or medium trump, it is better to use it at
the first opportunity. Unless the player has some hopes of winning
the pool himself, he should trump all doubtful cards; that is,
cards that may win the trick if not trumped. With two good
trumps, it is better to wait for developments; even if you cannot
win the last three tricks yourself, you may effectually spoil any
other player. Do anything you can to prevent the possibility of a
third trick being won by a player who has already won two.</p>

<h3>FORTY-FIVE, OR FIVE AND TEN.</h3>

<p>These names are given to Spoil Five when it is played by two
persons only, or by four or six divided into two equal partnerships.
There is no pool, as one side or the other must win three tricks
every deal. The side winning the odd trick counts five points
towards game, or ten points if it wins all five tricks. Forty-five
points is game. In another variation, each trick counts five points,
and the winners’ score is deducted from the losers’, so that if one
side wins four tricks it counts fifteen towards game. When this
manner of counting is adopted, the players count out; that is, if
each side is 35 up, the first to win two tricks counts out.</p>

<p>Minor variations are sometimes introduced; such as robbing
with the King, if the ace is not in play; counting five for the
dealer’s side if the ace or King is turned up, etc.</p>

<p>There are no <i><b>Text Books</b></i> on Spoil Five; but descriptions and
laws of the game are to be found in the “Westminster Papers,”
Vol II., and in “Round Games,” by Berkeley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<h3>RAMS, OR RAMMES</h3>

<p>This game seems to be the connecting link between the more
strongly marked members of the Euchre family and Division Loo.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Rams is played with the euchre pack, thirty-two
cards, which rank as at Écarté, K Q J A 10 9 8 7. It has lately
become the fashion, however, to adopt the rank of the cards in
the piquet pack, A K Q J 10 9 8 7.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Any number from three to six may play; but
when six play the dealer takes no cards. The general arrangements
for the players, first deal, counters, etc., are exactly the
same as at Spoil Five.</p>

<p><i><b>THE POOL.</b></i> Each successive dealer puts up five counters,
to form or to augment the pool.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> The cards having been properly shuffled and
cut, five are given to each player; two the first round and three
the next, or three the first round and two the next. An extra
hand, known as the <i><b>widow</b></i>, is dealt face downward in the centre
of the table. The dealer gives cards to the widow just before
dealing to himself in each round. When all are helped, the next
card is turned up for the trump. Irregularities in the deal are
governed by the same rules as in Spoil Five.</p>

<p><i><b>DECLARING TO PLAY.</b></i> Each player in turn, beginning
with the eldest hand, may either play or pass. If he passes,
he lays his cards face downward in front of him, and takes no
further part in that deal unless a general rams is announced. If
he plays, he engages himself to take at least one trick, or forfeit
five counters to the pool. He may play with the hand originally
dealt him, or he may risk getting a better by taking the widow in
exchange. If he exchanges, his original hand is dead, and must
not be seen by any player. If any player takes the widow, those
following him must play the hand dealt them or pass out. In
some clubs the eldest hand is obliged to play, either with his own
hand or with the widow.</p>

<p>If all pass except the pone, he must play against the dealer,
either with the cards dealt him, or with the widow. If he declines
to play, he must pay the dealer five counters, and the pool
remains. The dealer must play if he is opposed by only one
player; but if two others have announced to play, the dealer may
play or pass as he pleases. If he plays, he may discard and take
up the trump card. No other player may rob the trump.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The eldest hand of those
who have declared to play begins by leading any card he pleases.
Each player in turn must head the trick; that is, play a higher
card if he can. If he has two higher, he may play either. If he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
has none of the suit led, he must trump if he can, even if the trick
is already trumped by another player. For instance: Hearts are
trumps, and A leads a club. B follows suit, but neither C nor D
has a club. Suppose C trumps with the King, and that the only
trump D has is the Queen, he must play it on the trick, losing it to
C’s King. When a player can neither follow suit nor trump, he
may discard any card he pleases. The winner of the trick leads
for the next trick, and so on until all five tricks have been played.</p>

<p><i><b>PENALTIES.</b></i> There is only one penalty in Rams; to win
nothing on the deal, and to forfeit five counters to the next pool.
This is inflicted for playing with more or less than five cards; for
exposing any card; for leading or playing out of turn; for renouncing;
and for refusing to head or trump a trick when able to do so.</p>

<p><i><b>DIVIDING THE POOL.</b></i> Pools may be simple or
double. The usual custom is to compel every one to play when
the pool is a simple, containing nothing but the five counters put
up by the dealer. When there are more than five counters in the
pool they must be some multiple of five, and the pool is called a
double. In double pools the players may play or pass as they
please. No matter how many counters are already in the pool,
the dealer must add five.</p>

<p>Each player gathers in the tricks he wins, and at the end of the
hand he is entitled to take one-fifth of the contents of the pool for
every trick he has won. If he has played his hand, and failed to
get a trick, he is ramsed, and forfeits five counters to form the
next pool, in addition to those which will be put up by the next
dealer. If two or more players fail to win a trick, they must each
pay five counters, and if the player whose turn it will be to deal
next is ramsed, he will have to put up ten; five for his deal, and
five for the rams.</p>

<p><i><b>GENERAL RAMS.</b></i> If any player thinks he can win all
five tricks, with the advantage of the first lead, he may announce
a general rams, when it comes to his turn to pass or play. This
announcement may be made either before or after taking the
widow. When a general rams is announced, all at the table must
play, and those who have passed and laid down their hands, must
take them up again. If the widow has not been taken, any player
who has not already refused it may take it. The player who announced
general rams has the first lead. If he succeeds in getting
all five tricks, he not only gets the pool but receives five
counters in addition from each player. If he fails, he must double
the amount then in the pool, and pay five counters to each of his
adversaries. Any player taking a trick that spoils a general rams
gets nothing from the pool, and it is usual to abandon the hands
the moment the announcing player loses a trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<h3>ROUNCE.</h3>

<p>This is an American corruption of Rams. It is played with the
full pack of fifty-two cards, which rank as at Whist, and any
number of players from three to nine. Six cards are dealt to
the widow, one of which must be discarded by the player taking
it. All pools are alike, there being no difference between simples
and doubles, and there is no such announcement as general rounce.
There is no obligation to head the trick, nor to trump or under-trump;
but the winner of the first trick must lead a trump if he
has one.</p>

<h3>BIERSPIEL.</h3>

<p>This is a popular form of Rams among German students.
Three crosses are chalked on the table in front of each player,
representing five points each. When a trick is won, a beer-soaked
finger wipes out the centre of a cross, and reduces its value to
four. Successive cancellings of the remaining arms of the cross as
tricks are taken gradually reduce it to nothing, and the player who
is last to wipe out his third cross pays for the beer. No player is
allowed to look at his cards until the trump is turned, and the
dealer gives the word of command: “Auf.” The seven of
diamonds is always the second-best card of the trump suit, ranking
next below the ace. If it is turned up, the dealer turns up the
next card for a trump, and when it comes to his turn, he can take
both cards into his hand, discarding others in their place. If the
dealer passes, the eldest hand may take up the trump. If only
two declare to play, a trump must be led for the first trick; if
three play, trumps must be led twice; if four play, three times. If
the leader has no trump, he must lead his smallest card, face
downward, which calls for a trump from such of the other players
as have one. All penalties are made by adding fresh crosses
to the delinquent’s score.</p>

<h3>LOO, OR DIVISION LOO.</h3>

<p>This was at one time the most popular of all round games at
cards; but its cousin Napoleon seems to have usurped its place in
England, while Poker has eclipsed it in America. There are several
varieties of the game, but the most common form is Three-card
Limited Loo, which will be first described.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Loo is played with a full pack of fifty-two cards,
which rank, A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2; the ace being the highest.</p>

<p><i><b>COUNTERS.</b></i> Loo being a pool game, counters are necessary.
They should be of two colours, white and red, one red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
banker, to sell and redeem all counters. Each player should begin
with 18 red and 6 white, which is equal to 20 reds.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Any number of persons from three to seventeen
may play, but eight is the usual limit, and five or six makes
the best game. The players take their seats at random.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> A card is dealt round to each player, face up,
and the first Jack takes the first deal.</p>

<p><i><b>THE POOL.</b></i> Each successive dealer places three red
counters in the pool. The pool is added to from time to time by
penalties for infractions of the rules, and by forfeitures from
players who have failed in their undertakings. Such payments
are always made in red counters, the number being always three
or six. When the pool is divided, it sometimes happens that a
player is not allowed to withdraw his share. In such cases the
red counters representing it should be changed for their value in
white ones, so that the forfeited share may be divided in three
parts.</p>

<p>The difference between <i><b>Limited Loo</b></i>, and <i><b>Unlimited Loo</b></i>,
is in the amounts paid into the pool. In Limited Loo the penalty
is always three or six red counters. In Unlimited Loo, it is the
same for irregularities, and for infraction of the rules; but any
player failing in his undertaking must put up for the next pool an
amount equal to that in the current pool. When two or more
fail on successive deals the pool increases with surprising rapidity.
A player at twenty-five cent Loo has been known to lose $320 in
three consecutive deals.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> The pack having been properly shuffled and
cut, the dealer gives three cards to each player, one at a time in
rotation, beginning on his left. The first deal, and every deal in
which the pool contains only the three red counters put up by the
dealer, is known as a <i><b>simple</b></i>, and no trump card is turned up
until one or two tricks have been played to. If there are more
than three red counters in the pool, it is known as a <i><b>double</b></i>, and
an extra hand must be dealt for the <i><b>widow</b></i>, and after all have been
helped, the next card in the pack is turned up for a trump. The
dealer gives cards to the widow just before helping himself in each
round.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in the Deal.</b></i> If the pack is found to be imperfect,
or any card except the trump is found faced in the pack,
the same dealer must deal again without penalty. If the dealer
neglects to have the pack cut; reshuffles it after it has been
properly cut; deals a card incorrectly and fails to correct the
error before dealing another; exposes a card in dealing; gives
any player too many or too few cards; or deals a wrong number
of hands, it is a misdeal, and he loses his deal, and forfeits three
red counters to the current pool. The new dealer adds his three
counters as usual, and the pool becomes a double.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> A description of the method
of playing will be better understood if it is divided into two parts,
as it varies in simple and in double pools.</p>

<p><i><b>In Simple Pools</b></i>, no trump is turned, and no widow dealt.
Should the dealer inadvertently turn a trump, he forfeits three red
counters to the current pool, but it remains a simple. If he deals
a card for a widow, and fails to correct himself before dealing
another card, it is a misdeal.</p>

<p>The eldest hand leads any card he pleases, and the others must
not only follow suit, but must head the trick if they can. This
does not necessarily mean that they shall play the best card they
hold of the suit led, but that they shall play a better one than any
already played. The cards are left in front of the players. If all
follow suit the winner of the trick leads any card he pleases for
the next trick. If all follow suit to that again, the winner leads
for the next, and if all follow suit again, that ends it, and the
winners of the several tricks divide the pool. All those who have
not won a trick are <i><b>looed</b></i>, and must contribute three red counters
each for the next pool, which, added to the three to be deposited
by the next dealer, will make the ensuing pool a double. But if
in any trick any player is unable to follow suit, as soon as the
trick is complete the dealer turns up the top card on the remainder
of the pack, and the suit to which it belongs is the trump. If
any trump has been played, the highest trump wins the trick. In
any case, the winner of the trick must lead a trump for the next trick
if he has one. When all three tricks have been played, the winner
of each is entitled to one-third of the contents of the pool. Those
who have not won a trick are looed, and must contribute three
red counters each for the next pool. This is called a <i><b>Bold Stand</b></i>.</p>

<p><i><b>In Double Pools</b></i>, an extra hand is dealt for the widow, and a
trump is turned. No player is allowed to look at his cards until
it comes to his turn to declare. The dealer, beginning on his left,
asks each in turn to announce his intentions. The player may
<i><b>stand</b></i> with the cards dealt him; or may <i><b>take the widow</b></i> in
exchange; or may <i><b>pass</b></i>. If he passes or takes the widow, he
gives his original hand to the dealer, who places it on the bottom
of the pack. If he takes the widow or stands, he must win at
least one trick, or he is looed, and will forfeit three red counters to
the next pool.</p>

<p>If all pass but the player who has taken the widow, he wins the
pool without playing, and the next deal must be a simple. If only
one player stands, and he has not taken the widow, the dealer,
if he will not play for himself, must take the widow and play to
defend the pool. If he fails to take a trick, he is not looed; but
the payment for any tricks he wins must be left in the pool, and
the red counters for them should be changed for white ones, so
that the amount may be easily divided at the end of the next pool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Flushes.</b></i> If any player in a double pool holds three trumps,
whether dealt him or found in the widow, he must announce it
as soon as all have declared whether or not they will play. The
usual custom is to wait until the dealer declares, and then to ask
him: “How many play?” The dealer replies: “Two in;”
“Three in;” or: “Widow and one;” as the case may be. The
player with the flush then shows it, and claims the pool without
playing, each of those who are “in” being looed three red
counters. If two players hold a flush in trumps, the elder hand
wins, whether his trumps are better or not; but the younger hand,
holding another flush, is not looed.</p>

<p><i><b>Leading.</b></i> In all double pools, the eldest hand of those playing
must lead a trump if he has one. If he has the ace of trumps
he must lead that; or if he has the King and the ace is turned up.
The old rule was that a player must lead the higher of two trumps,
but this is obsolete. The winner of a trick must lead a trump if
he has one. Each player in turn must head the trick if he can; if
he has none of the suit led he must trump or over-trump if he can;
but he need not under-trump a trick already trumped.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities and Penalties.</b></i> There is only one penalty
in Loo, to win nothing from the current pool, and to pay either
three or six reds to the next pool. If the offender has won any
tricks, the payment for them must be left in the pool in white
counters, to be divided among the winners of the next pool.</p>

<p>The offences are divided, some being paid for to the current
pool, such as those for errors in the deal, while others are not paid
until the current pool has been divided. If any player looks at
his hand before his turn to declare, or the dealer does so before
asking the others whether or not they will play, or if any player
announces his intention out of his proper turn; the offender in each
case forfeits three red counters to the current pool, and cannot win
anything that deal, but he may play his hand in order to keep
counters in the pool. If he plays and is looed, he must pay.</p>

<p><i><b>Revokes.</b></i> If a player, when able to do so, fails to follow suit,
or to head the trick, or to lead trumps, or to lead the ace of
trumps, (or King when ace is turned,) or to trump a suit of which
he is void, the hands are abandoned on discovery of the error,
and the pool is divided as equally as possible among those who
declared to play, with the exception of the offender. Any odd
white counters must be left for the next pool. The player in fault
is then held guilty of a revoke, and must pay a forfeit of six red
counters to the next pool. The reason for the division of the pool
is that there is no satisfactory way to determine how the play
would have resulted had the revoke not occurred. It is impossible
to take back the cards and replay them, because no one would
have a right to judge how much a person’s play was altered by his
knowledge of the cards in the other hands.</p>

<p>If a player, having already won a trick, renders himself liable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
any penalty, as for exposing a card, leading or following suit out
of turn, or abandoning his hand, he is looed for three red counters,
payable to the next pool, and the payment for the tricks he has
won must be left in the pool in white counters.</p>

<h3>IRISH LOO.</h3>

<p>In this variation, no widow is dealt, and there is no distinction
between simple and double pools. A trump is always turned up,
and the dealer asks each in turn, beginning on his left, whether or
not he will play, taking up the cards of those who decline to
stand. He then announces his own decision, and proceeds to ask
those who have declared to play whether or not they wish to
exchange any of the cards originally dealt them. The usual question
is simply: “How many?” and the player names the number
of cards he wishes to exchange, if any; at the same time discarding
others in their places. The number first asked for cannot be
amended or recalled. The trump is laid aside, and the cards
called for are dealt from the remainder of the pack, without further
shuffling. In all other respects, the game is Three-card Loo.</p>

<h3>FIVE-CARD LOO.</h3>

<p>This is Irish Loo with some additional variations. Each red
counter should be worth five white ones, and the players will
require about fifty red counters each at starting. The dealer puts
up five red counters. Any player holding a flush of five cards in
any suit may immediately claim the pool, and every person at the
table, whether playing or not, is supposed to be looed, and pays
five red counters to the next pool. If two players hold flushes,
the elder hand wins, even if the younger hand holds a flush in
trumps.</p>

<p>Another variation is to make the club Jack, which is known as
<i><b>Pam</b></i>, always the best trump. Combined with four cards of any
suit, this card will make a flush. If any player leads the trump
ace, the holder of Pam must pass the trick if he can do so without
revoking. The old usage was for the holder of the trump ace to
notify any player holding Pam to pass, if he wished him to do so;
but that is quite superfluous, as no player wants to lose his ace of
trumps, and it goes without saying that he wants Pam to pass it.</p>

<h2 id="ALL_FOURS_FAMILY">ALL FOURS FAMILY.</h2>

<p>All Fours is to be found amongst the oldest games of cards,
and is the parent of a large family of variations, all of which are
of American birth. The youngest member of the family, Cinch,
seems to have a bright future before it, and bids fair to become one
of our most popular games. The chief defect in Cinch has been
the method of scoring, which left too much to luck. In the following
pages the author has attempted to remedy this.</p>

<p>The name, “All Fours,” seems to have been varied at
times to “All Four,” and was derived from four of the five points
which counted towards game; the fifth point, for “gift” having
been apparently quite overlooked. The game was originally ten
points up, and the cards were dealt one at a time. According to
the descriptions in some of the older Hoyles, the honours and Tens
of the plain suits did not count towards game; but this is evidently
an error, for we find in the same editions the advice to trump or
win the adversary’s best cards in plain suits. This would obviously
be a mere waste of trumps if these plain-suit cards did not count for
anything.</p>

<p>All Fours seems to have been popular with all classes of society
at one time or another. Cotton’s “Compleat Gamester” gives it
among the principal games in his day, 1674. Daines Barrington,
writing a hundred years later, speaks of All Fours in connection
with Whist. “Whist,” he says, “seems never to have been played
on principles until about fifty years ago; before that time [1735] it
was confined chiefly to the servants’ hall, with All Fours and Put.”
Another writer tells us that Ombre was the favourite game of the
ladies, and Piquet of the gentlemen <i>par excellence</i>; clergymen
and country squires preferring Whist, “while the lower orders
shuffled away at All Fours, Put, Cribbage, and Lanterloo.” In
1754 a pamphlet was published containing: “Serious Reflections
on the dangerous tendency of the common practice of Card-playing;
especially the game of All Four.” For many years All Fours was
looked upon as the American gambler’s game <i>par excellence</i>, and
it is still the great standby of our coloured brother; who would
sooner swallow a Jack than have it caught.</p>

<h3>ALL FOURS, SEVEN-UP, OR OLD SLEDGE.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Seven-up is played with the full pack of fifty-two
cards, which rank A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2; the ace being the
highest, both in cutting and in play.</p>

<p><i><b>COUNTERS.</b></i> Each player or side should be provided with
seven counters. As the points accrue, these counters are got rid
of by placing them in a pool in the centre of the table. By this
method a glance will show how many each side or player has “to
go,” that is, how many will put him out.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Two, three or four persons may play. When
three play, the game resembles Cut-throat Euchre, each for himself.
When four play, two are partners against the other two, and
the partners sit opposite each other. The player on the dealer’s
left, or his adversary if only two play, is always spoken of as the
eldest or elder hand. The one on the dealer’s right is the pone.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> If there are four players, they cut for partners,
deal, and choice of seats. The two lowest are partners against
the two highest; the highest cut has the choice of seats, and deals
the first hand. When two or three play, they cut for seats and
deal. In cutting, the ace is high. Ties cut again; but the new
cut decides nothing but the tie.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> If there is any stake, it is for so much a game.
Rubbers are never played.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> Each player has the right to shuffle the pack,
the dealer last, and the cards are then presented to the pone to be
cut. At least four cards must be left in each packet. Beginning
on his left, the dealer gives six cards to each player, three on the
first round, and three more on the second round, turning up the
next card for the trump, and leaving it on the remainder of the
pack. If this card is a Jack, the dealer counts one point for it
immediately; but if any player is found to have an incorrect
number of cards, and announces it before he plays to the first trick,
the Jack cannot be counted, as it could not have been the proper
trump.</p>

<p>In <i><b>Pitch, or Blind All Fours</b></i>, no trump is turned. The
first card led or “pitched” by the eldest hand is the trump suit
for that deal.</p>

<p><i><b>MISDEALING.</b></i> If any card is found faced in the pack, or
the pack is proved to be imperfect, the same dealer deals again.
If he deals without having the cards cut, or gives too many or too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
few cards to any player, it is a misdeal, and the deal passes to
the next player on the misdealer’s left. If the dealer exposes a
card, the adversaries may elect to have the deal stand, or to have a
new deal by the same dealer. In <i><b>Pitch</b></i>, a misdeal does not lose
the deal, because the deal is no advantage.</p>

<p><i><b>BEGGING.</b></i> The deal completed, and the trump turned, the
eldest hand looks at his cards, the other players leaving theirs untouched.
If the eldest hand is not satisfied, he says: <i><b>I beg</b></i>; and
the dealer, after examining his own hand, has the option of giving
him a point or <i><b>running the cards</b></i>. If he decides to give the
point, he says: <i><b>Take it</b></i>, and the eldest hand immediately scores
one for the <i><b>gift</b></i>. If the dealer will not give, he lays the trump
card aside, and deals three more cards to each player, including
himself; turning up another trump. Should this be a Jack of
another suit, the dealer scores a point for it at once. Should it be
of the same suit as that first turned up, the Jack cannot be scored,
as the dealer has declined to have that suit for the trump. When
the same suit is turned up a second time, the card is laid aside;
three more cards are given to each player, another trump is turned,
and so on until a different suit comes up for the trump. If the
pack is exhausted before another suit turns up, the cards must be
<i><b>bunched</b></i>, and the same dealer deals again.</p>

<p>The dealer’s partner and the pone are not permitted to look at
their cards until the eldest hand and the dealer have decided
whether to stand or run the cards. Among strict players, if a
person looks at his hand before the proper time, the adversaries
score a point. The object of this rule is to prevent the possibility
of any expression of satisfaction or disapproval of the turn-up
trump.</p>

<p>No second beg is allowed, but when only two play, if either
player is dissatisfied with the new trump he may propose to
<i><b>bunch the cards</b></i>. If the proposition is agreed to, the cards are
reshuffled and dealt again by the same dealer. If three play, the
dealer must give a point to both adversaries if he refuses to run
the cards, although only one begs. The dealer cannot give a
player enough to put him out.</p>

<p><i><b>DISCARDING.</b></i> When the cards have been run, the usual
practice is to discard all superfluous cards, each player reducing
his hand to six, with which he plays. In some clubs it is the rule
to keep all the cards if only nine are in each hand, but to discard
down to six if two or more rounds were dealt after turning the
first trump.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> The object in Seven-up is
to secure certain points which count towards game. As its name
implies, the game is won when a player has put up seven of his
counters, each of which represents a point. There are six different
ways of making these points, and it is possible for one player<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
to make five of them in one deal; but he cannot by any possibility
make seven. The following count one point each:</p>

<p>1st. Turning up the <i><b>Jack</b></i> of trumps.</p>

<p>2nd. Being <i><b>given</b></i> a point by the dealer.</p>

<p>3rd. Holding the <i><b>Highest</b></i> trump.</p>

<p>4th. Holding the <i><b>Lowest</b></i> trump.</p>

<p>5th. Winning a trick with the <i><b>Jack</b></i> of trumps in it.</p>

<p>6th. Making the majority of the pips that count for what is
called <i><b>Game</b></i>.</p>

<p><i><b>Turning the Jack</b></i> is entirely a matter of chance, and should
not occur more than once in thirteen deals. If a Jack is turned
every few deals, you may be sure that unfair methods are being
used. Nothing is more common among advantage players than
turning up Jacks every few deals.</p>

<p><i><b>Begging</b></i> is resorted to by a player who holds no trumps, or
such indifferent ones that it is very unlikely they will be either
High or Low. If he has anything better, such as very high or
low cards in other suits, such a hand is called, “a good hand to
run to,” and the player begs, hoping the new trump will better fit
his hand. If he has nothing better in other suits than in the turn-up,
it will still be slightly in his favour to beg, unless he has trumps
enough to give him some hopes of making the point for Game. It
is a fatal error to beg on good cards, and gamblers have a saying
that he who begs a point to-day, will beg a stake to-morrow.</p>

<p><i><b>High</b></i> and <i><b>Low</b></i> count to the player to whom those cards are
dealt, and there is no chance to alter the fortunes of the deal except
by begging and running the cards. These two points may
both be made by the same card, if it is the only trump in play;
because High is counted for the best trump out during the deal,
and Low for the lowest, no matter what the cards are.</p>

<p><i><b>Catching the Jack</b></i>, or saving it, is one of the principal objects
of the game, and as a rule a player holding the Jack should
lose no opportunity to save such a valuable counting card. On
the other hand, a player holding higher trumps will often have to
use good judgment as to whether to lead them to catch the Jack,
if it happens to be out; or to keep quiet until the last few tricks,
when if the Jack is not out, such trumps may be useful to win
cards that count for Game.</p>

<p><i><b>The Game</b></i> is generally known as <i><b>the gambler’s point</b></i>, because
it is the only point that must be played for in every hand,
and its management requires more skill than all the others put together.
The cards that count for Game are the four honours and
the Ten of each suit. Every ace counts 4; every King 3; every
Queen 2; every Jack 1; and every Ten 10. After the last card has
been played, each player turns over the tricks he has won, and
counts up the pip value of the court cards and Tens that he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
won. Whoever has the highest number counts the point for Game.
For instance: Two are playing. The elder hand has taken in an
ace, two Kings and a Jack, which are collectively worth 11. The
dealer has taken in a Queen and a Ten, which are worth 12; so the
dealer marks the point for Game. If both players have the same
number, or if there is no Game out, which rarely happens, the non-dealer
scores Game. If three play, and Game is a tie between the
two non-dealers, neither scores. The non-dealer is given the
benefit of counting a tie for Game as an offset to the dealer’s advantage
in turning Jacks. When no trump is turned, as in Pitch,
no one can count Game if it is a tie.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The eldest hand begins by
leading any card he pleases. If a trump is led, each player must
follow suit if able. When a plain suit is led he need not follow
suit if he prefers to trump; but if he does not trump, he must follow
suit if he can. If he has none of the suit led he may either
trump or discard. This rule is commonly expressed by saying that
a player may <i><b>follow suit or trump</b></i>. The highest card played
of the suit led wins the trick, and trumps win all other suits. The
winner of the trick takes it in, and leads for the next one, and so
on until all the cards have been played. The tricks themselves
have no value except for the court cards and Tens they contain.</p>

<p>As High, Jack, and Game are always counted by the player holding
those points at the end of the play, there can be no question
about them: but serious disputes sometimes arise as to who played
Low. The best method of avoiding this is for each player, as the
game proceeds, to announce and claim the lowest trump which
has so far appeared, and instead of giving it to the current trick,
to leave it turned face up in front of him if it is of no counting
value. For instance: Four are playing, and a round of trumps
comes out, the six being the lowest. The player holding it announces:
“Six for Low,” and keeps the card face up in front of
him until some smaller trump appears. It often happens that a
player holds a 7 or 8, and having no idea that it will be Low, takes
no notice of it. At the end of the hand it is found that both the
7 and 8 are out, the 7 being Low, and the holders of those two
cards get into an argument as to which card each of them held.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> The last card played, the various points for High,
Low, Jack, (if in play), and the Game are claimed, and the player or
side holding them puts a counter in the pool for each. The side
first getting rid of its seven counters wins the game. If both sides
make points enough to win the game on the same deal, High goes
out first, then Low, then Jack, and then Game. As already noticed,
one card may be both High and Low; the Jack may be High, Low,
Jack; and it is even possible, if there is no other trump or counting
card in play, for the Jack to be High, Low, Jack, and the
Game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>In the variety known as <i><b>All Fives</b></i>, the score is kept on a cribbage
board, and part of it is pegged as the hand progresses. A
player winning a trick containing any of the following cards in the
trump suit pegs them immediately:&mdash;For the trump ace, 4 points;
for the King 3; for the Queen 2; for the Jack 1; for the Ten 10,
and for the Five 5. After the hand is over, all these cards are
counted over again in reckoning the point for Game, the Five of
trumps counting 5. Sixty-one points is game.</p>

<p><i><b>IRREGULARITIES IN PLAY.</b></i> The most serious
error in Seven-up is the <i><b>revoke</b></i>. If a player does not follow suit
when able, it is a revoke unless he trumps the trick. A player
holding two small trumps and the Ten of a plain suit, may trump
both the ace and King of that suit instead of giving up his Ten.
But if on the third round the Queen is led, and he cannot trump it,
he must play his Ten if he has no other card of the suit.</p>

<p>The only points affected by the revoke are Jack and Game. <i><b>If
the Jack is not in play</b></i>, there is only one point that can be
affected by the revoke, the score for Game; and the revoke penalty
is one point, which the adversary may add to his own score, or deduct
from the score of the revoking player. The adversary may
also score the point for Game if he makes it; but it cannot be
scored by the revoking player; who may mark only High or Low
if he holds either or both of those points.</p>

<p><i><b>If the Jack is in play</b></i>, two points may be affected by a revoke.
The player in fault cannot score either Jack or Game, and
the penalty for the revoke is two points; in addition to which the
adversary of the revoking player may score either or both Jack
and Game if he makes them.</p>

<p>The revoking player cannot win the game that hand, no matter
what he scores, but must stop at six. A revoke is established as
soon as the trick in which it occurs has been turned and quitted,
or a card has been led or played to the next trick.</p>

<p><i><b>Exposed Cards.</b></i> When four play, all exposed cards must be
left on the table, and are liable to be called by the adversaries if
they cannot be previously got rid of in the course of play. All
cards led or played out of turn are exposed, and liable to be called.
If two or more cards are played to a trick, the adversaries may select
which shall remain; the other is exposed.</p>

<p><i><b>METHODS OF CHEATING.</b></i> Few games lend themselves
more readily to the operations of the greek than Seven-up.
Turning Jacks from the bottom of the pack; setting up the half-stock
for the beg; dealing oneself more than six cards, and
dropping on the tricks already won those counting for Game;
getting the A J 10 and 2 of a suit together during the play of a
hand, and then shifting the cut to get them on the next deal, turning
up the Jack; marked cards; strippers; wedges; reflectors;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
these and many other tricks are in common use. Those who are
not expert enough to deal seconds or shift cuts will sometimes resort
to such trifling advantages as abstracting one of the Tens from
the pack, so that they may know a suit from which a small card
can always be led without any danger of the adversary’s making
the Ten. One very common swindle in Seven-up is known as
<i><b>the high hand</b></i>, which consists in giving the intended victim the
A K J 10 9 2 of trumps, and then inducing him to bet that he will
make four points. No matter how skilful the player may be, he
will find it impossible to save both Jack and Game.</p>

<h3>CALIFORNIA JACK.</h3>

<p>This is a variety of Seven-up for two players, in which the
number of cards in the hand is constantly restored to six by drawing
from the remainder of the pack.</p>

<p>The trump suit is cut for before the cards are shuffled and dealt.
The usual method is to cut for seats and deal, and the highest cut
determines the trump suit at the same time. After each player
has been given six cards, three at a time, the remainder of the pack
is turned face up on the table, and the winner of each trick takes
the top card, his adversary taking the next one. When the stock is
exhausted, the last six cards are played as in the ordinary game
of Seven-up.</p>

<p>Seven points is game, the points being the same as in Seven-up;
but everything, including Low, counts to the player winning it.</p>

<p><i><b>Shasta Sam</b></i> is California Jack with the remainder of the pack
turned face down, and is a much better game on that account.</p>

<h3>AUCTION PITCH, SELL OUT, OR COMMERCIAL PITCH.</h3>

<p>This very popular round game derives its name from the fact
that the first card led or “pitched” is the trump suit, and that the
privilege of pitching it belongs to the eldest hand, who may sell it
out to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>The number of <i><b>cards</b></i> and their rank is the same as at Seven-up;
A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2, the ace being the highest in cutting
and in play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Players.</b></i> Any number from four to seven may play, each
for himself; five is considered the best game. The players cut
for choice of seats, the highest cut taking the first choice and the
deal.</p>

<p><i><b>Counters.</b></i> Each player should be provided with seven white
counters to mark the game. If stakes are played for, red counters
are used to make up the pool, one player acting as the banker to
sell and redeem all red counters.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> Six cards are dealt to each player, three at a time,
but no trump is turned. All the rules for irregularities in the deal
are the same as in Seven-up, but a misdeal does not lose the deal
under any circumstances.</p>

<p><i><b>Objects of the Game.</b></i> As in Seven-up, the object of each
player is to get rid of his seven counters, one of which he is entitled
to put in the pool for each of the following points: For holding
the <i><b>highest</b></i> trump in play; for holding (having dealt to him)
the <i><b>lowest</b></i> trump in play; for winning a trick with the <i><b>Jack</b></i> of
trumps in it; for making the greatest number of the pips that count
for the <i><b>game</b></i> point. The details of these points have already
been explained in connection with Seven-up. If the count for
Game is a tie, no one scores it.</p>

<p><i><b>Bidding.</b></i> The eldest hand sells. If he pitches without waiting
for a bid he must make four points, or he will be set back that
number. Each player in turn, beginning on the left of the eldest
hand, bids for the privilege of pitching the trump, naming the
number of points he thinks he can make. If he will not bid, he
must say distinctly: “<i><b>I pass</b></i>.” After a bid has been made,
any following player must bid higher or pass. There are no
second bids. The highest number any player can bid is four,
which will require him to make High, Low, Jack, and the Game
against the combined efforts of all the other players. The eldest
hand must either accept the number bid, or pitch the trump himself,
and make as many points as the highest bidder offered him.
If the eldest hand accepts, he pushes into the pool as many
counters as he is bid, and the successful bidder pitches the trump.
If no bid is made, the eldest hand must pitch the trump himself.</p>

<p>A bidder is not allowed to give the seller enough points to put
him out, and should he do so by mistake, he forfeits his right to
bid at all for that deal. If the seller has only two to go, and a
player is able to bid three or four, he loses nothing by bidding
one only, for no one can overbid him, and he is entitled to count
all he makes. The only risk he runs is that the seller can afford
to refuse one, and will go out on his own pitch. To remedy this
it is the custom in some clubs to allow a player to bid the full
value of his hand. If the seller accepts, he scores to within one
of game; but if he refuses, he must make as many as bid, even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
he does not actually want them. It is one of the fine points of
the game for the seller to refuse when the number of points
offered would put the bidder out if he was successful.</p>

<p>There is no penalty for bidding out of turn. If a player chooses
to expose to a preceding player what he is prepared to bid, that is
usually to his own disadvantage.</p>

<p><i><b>Bidding to the Board.</b></i> Modern players usually adopt the
practice of bidding to the board, eldest hand having the first bid.
In this form of the game the points bid count to no one, and anyone
can bid up to four, no matter what the scores are. No one
can claim the privilege of pitching the trump for as many as bid, as
each in turn must bid higher or pass.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing.</b></i> The successful bidder has the first lead, and whatever
card he plays, whether by mistake or not, is the trump suit
for that deal. After that, the winner of the trick may lead any
suit he pleases. A player must follow suit in trumps if he is able
to do so; but in a plain suit he may trump if he chooses, although
holding a card of the suit led. If he does not trump, he must
follow suit if he can. If he has none of the suit led, he may
trump or discard as he pleases. The highest card played of the
suit led wins the trick, and trumps win all other suits.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> At the end of the hand the various players claim
the points made, and score them by placing white counters in the
pool. If the bidder makes any points in excess of the number
bid, he scores them. The first player to get rid of his seven white
counters wins the pool, and takes down all the red counters it
contains. The white counters are then redistributed, and the
players cut for the first deal of the new game.</p>

<p>If two players can count out on the same deal, and one of them
is the bidder, he wins the pool if he has made good his bid. If
neither of the ties is the bidder, the points count out in their
regular order, High first, then Low, then Jack, and finally Game.
For instance: Seven are playing. A sells to B, who bids two. B
and C have each two to go. B pitches a trump of which C has
both High and Low; but if B makes Jack and Game he wins the
pool, because he bid only two points, and made them. This is
generally expressed by the rule: <i><b>bidder goes out first</b></i>.</p>

<p><i><b>Setting Back.</b></i> If the player who pitches the trump fails to
make the number of points bid, he is set back, and scores nothing
for any points he may have made. A player who is set back,
either for overbidding his hand, or for refusing to sell and failing
to make the number of points offered him, must withdraw from
the pool as many white counters as were bid, and add them to his
own. For instance: It is A’s sell. A and B each have two to
go. B bids three, which A refuses, pitching the trump himself.
A makes only two points, B scoring one, and a third player D,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
another. B and D score one each, but A scores nothing for the
two points he made, and must take three white counters from the
pool, which will make him five to go. Had the bid which A refused
been two only, he would have won the game, as he made
two points. In many clubs it is the custom for a player who is
set back to add a red counter to the pool.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in Play.</b></i> If any adversary of the player
who pitches the trump leads or plays out of turn, he may be called
upon by the bidder to play his highest or lowest of the suit led; or
to trump or not to trump the trick. If any player but the pitcher
has followed the erroneous lead, the cards must be taken back;
but if the pitcher has followed, the error cannot be rectified.</p>

<p>In case of a <i><b>revoke</b></i>, the hand is played out as if the revoke had
not occurred, and each player except the person in error counts
whatever points he makes. If the pitcher of the trump fails to
make the number of points bid, he cannot be set back, but must
be allowed to score any points he makes. The revoking player is
then set back the number of points bid, and forfeits a red counter
to the pool. If no bid was made, he is set back two points.</p>

<h4>SMUDGE.</h4>

<p>In this variation of auction pitch, any player who is not in the
hole wins the game at once if he can bid four and make it.</p>

<h3>PEDRO.</h3>

<p>Pedro, Pedro Sancho, Dom Pedro, and Snoozer, are all varieties
of Auction Pitch, in which certain counting cards are added, and
secondary bids are allowed.</p>

<p>Everything counts to the player winning it, instead of to the one
to whom it is dealt. The game point is scored by the player who
wins the trick containing the Ten of trumps. If that card is not
in play there is no Game.</p>

<p>In <i><b>Pedro Sancho</b></i>, the Five and Nine of trumps count their
pip value in scoring, so that 18 points can be bid and made on
one deal; one each for High, Low, Jack, and Game, and fourteen
more for the Nine and Five of trumps. These two trumps have no
special rank. The Ten will win the Nine, and the Six will take the
Five. In some places all the cards in the pack are dealt out, which
makes a much better game in any form of Pedro.</p>

<p>The eldest hand sells, as at Auction Pitch. If a player’s first
bid is raised he may raise again in his proper turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>Fifty points is game, and the players are usually provided with
two varieties of counters for scoring; one worth five points, and
the other worth one. The rank of the points in scoring is; High,
Low, Jack, Ten (Game), Five, and Nine. The revoke penalty is to
be set back the number of points bid, or ten points if there is no
bid, and the player in fault cannot score anything that hand. In
all other respects the rules are the same as in Auction Pitch.</p>

<p>In <i><b>Dom Pedro, or Snoozer</b></i>, the Joker is added to the pack,
and the Three, Five, and Nine of trumps count their pip value in
scoring. The Joker, or Snoozer, counts fifteen, so that thirty-six
points can be bid and made on one deal. The Joker is the lowest
trump, so that the deuce of trumps will win it, but it will win any
trick in plain suits. Fifty or a hundred points is the game. In
counting out, the order of precedence is: High, Low, Jack, Ten
(Game), Three, Five, Nine, Snoozer.</p>

<h3>CINCH, DOUBLE PEDRO, OR HIGH FIVE.</h3>

<p>This is now regarded as the most important variety of All Fours,
and bids fair to supplant the parent game altogether. Properly
speaking, Cinch is one of the pedro variations of Auction Pitch,
the difference being that no one sells, and that there is added the
always popular American feature of a draw to improve the hand.</p>

<p>The derivation and meaning of the name, Cinch, seems to be very
much misunderstood. Many persons assume it is simply a name
for the Left Pedro, but such is not the case. Cinch is a Mexican
word for a strong saddle-girth, and when used as a verb it refers
to the manner of adjusting the girth on a bucking broncho so that
no amount of kicking will get him free. The word is used in this
sense to describe one of the principal tactics of the card game,
which is to “cinch” certain tricks, so that the adversary cannot
possibly get either of the Pedroes free.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Cinch is played with a full pack of fifty-two cards
which rank A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. When the suit is trumps
the 5 retains its natural position, and is known as the <i><b>Right Pedro</b></i>;
but the 5 of the same colour as the trump suit, which is
known as the <i><b>Left Pedro</b></i>, ranks between the 5 and 4 of the trump
suit. The ace is highest in cutting and in play. Whist-players,
who have taken up Cinch as a side issue, are in the habit of making
the ace lowest in cutting; but such a practice is out of harmony
with all other members of the Seven-up family of games.</p>

<p><i><b>COUNTERS.</b></i> The score is usually kept on a sheet of paper;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
but it is more convenient to provide each side with 8 red and 11
white counters, representing 51 points; the whites being worth 1,
and the reds 5 each. A good pull-up cribbage board is still better.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Pull-Up Game Counter.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Any number from two to six can play; but the
regular game is for four persons, two of whom are partners against
the other two. The player on the dealer’s left is the <i><b>eldest
hand</b></i>; on the dealer’s right is the <i><b>pone</b></i>.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> The players draw from an outspread pack for
partners, seats, and deal. The two lowest play against the two
highest; the highest cut has the choice of seats and cards, and
deals the first hand. Partners sit opposite each other.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> Each player has the right to shuffle the pack,
the dealer last. The cards are then presented to the pone to be
cut, and at least four cards must be left in each packet. Beginning
on his left, the dealer gives nine cards to each player, three at
a time in three separate rounds. No trump is turned, and the
remainder of the pack is left on the table face downward.</p>

<p><i><b>MISDEALING.</b></i> If any card is found faced in the pack, the
cards must be reshuffled and dealt again. If the dealer exposes a
card in dealing, or turns up a trump by mistake, the adversaries
may elect to have a new deal by the same dealer, or to let the deal
stand. If the dealer gives too many or too few cards to any player,
or fails to give the same number of cards in each round, it is a
misdeal, and the deal passes to the next player on the left. Any
player dealing out of turn, or with the wrong cards, may be stopped
before the last three cards are dealt; but after that the deal
stands good. If a misdeal is not discovered until after a bid has
been made, the deal stands good if three players have their right
number of cards. The deal passes in regular rotation to the left.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> The game is fifty-one
points, and the side first pegging that number, or getting rid of its
fifty-one counters is the winner. Fourteen points are made on
every deal, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="How the fourteen points break down">

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr bt">14</td>
    <td>points altogether; all in the trump suit.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>All these points, including Low, count to the player winning
them, and not to the players to whom they are dealt. This saves
endless disputes.</p>

<p><i><b>BIDDING.</b></i> Beginning with the eldest hand, each player in
turn, after examining his nine cards, can make <i><b>one bid</b></i> for the
privilege of naming the trump suit. The peculiarity of this bidding
is that nobody sells, the bids being made <i><b>to the board</b></i>, as
it is called. The bidder announces the number of points he thinks
he can make (with his partner’s assistance) but does not name the
trump suit. If a player will not bid, he says: “<i><b>I pass</b></i>.” After
a bid has been made in its proper turn, any following player must
bid higher or pass. No one is allowed to bid more than fourteen.
There are no second bids, and a bid once made cannot be amended
or withdrawn. The player who has made the highest bid is called
upon to name the trump suit.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregular Bids.</b></i> If any player bids before the eldest hand
has bid or passed, both the player in error and his partner lose
their right to make any bid that deal; but the side not in error
must bid against each other for the privilege of naming the trump
suit. If the eldest hand has decided, and the pone bids without
waiting for the dealer’s partner, the pone loses his bid, and the
dealer may bid before his partner, without penalty. If the dealer
bids before his partner has decided, both he and his partner lose
their right to bid that deal; but the pone is still at liberty to overbid
the eldest hand for the privilege of naming the trump. If the
dealer’s partner has bid, and the dealer bids without waiting for
the pone, the dealer loses his right to bid for that deal.</p>

<p>If a player whose partner has not yet bid names the trump suit,
his partner loses the right to bid. If no bid is made, the dealer
may name any suit he pleases, without bidding. If any player
exposes a card before the trump suit is named, the adversaries may
elect to have a new deal by the same dealer.</p>

<p><i><b>DISCARDING AND DRAWING.</b></i> The trump suit
named, each player discards and leaves <i><b>face upward</b></i> on the
table as many cards as he pleases. He must discard three, to reduce
his hand to six cards. If he discards more than three he
must draw from the remainder of the pack to restore the number
of his cards to six; so that after the discard and draw each player
at the table will have exactly six cards, although nine were originally
dealt him.</p>

<p>The dealer, beginning on his left, gives to each player in turn as
many cards from the top of the pack as may be necessary to restore
the number in his hand to six. When it comes to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
dealer’s turn, instead of taking cards from the top of the pack, he
may search the remainder of the pack, and take from it any cards
that he pleases. This is called <i><b>robbing the deck</b></i>. Should he
find in his own hand and the remainder of the pack more than six
trumps, he must discard those he does not want, showing them
face up on the table with the other discards.</p>

<p>Should any player discard a trump, his partner has the right to
call his attention to it, and if the player has not been helped to
cards, or has not lifted the cards drawn, the trump erroneously
discarded may be taken back; otherwise it must remain among
the discards until the hand has been played, when, if it is of any
counting value, it must be added to the score of the side making
the trump.</p>

<p>Although there is no law to that effect, it is considered imperative
for each player except the dealer to discard everything but
trumps. This is partly because no other cards are of the slightest
use, and partly because one of the points of the game is that the
number of trumps held by each player before the draw should be
indicated by his discard.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The player who has named
the trump suit begins by leading any card he pleases. If a trump
is led, every one must follow suit if able to do so, and it must be
remembered that the Left Pedro is one of the trump suit. When
a plain suit is led, any player may trump if he chooses, although
holding one of the suit led; but if he does not trump, he must follow
suit if he can. If he has none of the suit led he may trump
or discard at pleasure. The highest card played of the suit led
wins the trick, and trumps win all other suits. The Five of trumps,
or any higher, will win the Left Pedro; but the Left Pedro will
win the Four of trumps, or any lower. The winner of the trick
gathers it in, turning it face down, and leads for the next trick, and
so on, until all six tricks have been played. The tricks themselves
have no value, and need not be kept separate. The last trick
turned and quitted may be seen, but no other.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in Playing.</b></i> If, during the play of a hand,
any person is found to have too many cards, his hand is foul, and
neither he nor his partner can score any points for that deal, but
they may play the hand out to prevent the adversaries from scoring
everything. If he has too few cards there is no penalty.</p>

<p>If a player leads out of turn, and the three others follow him,
the trick stands good. If all have not followed the false lead, their
cards must be taken back, but only the leader’s card is liable to be
called. If it was the turn of the partner of the player in error to
lead, the adversary on his right may call upon him to lead or not
to lead a trump; but he cannot specify the plain suit. If it was
the turn of either adversary of the player in error to lead, the card
led in error is simply exposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>If the third hand plays before the second, the fourth may play
before the second also. If the fourth hand plays before his partner,
third hand not having played, the trick may be claimed by the
adversaries, regardless of who wins it; but the player who actually
wins it leads for the next trick.</p>

<p>If a player has a card of the suit led, and neither follows suit
nor plays a trump, it is a <i><b>revoke</b></i>; and, if detected and claimed
by the adversaries, neither the player in error nor his partner can
score any points that hand; but the hand may be played out to
prevent the adversaries from scoring everything. If an adversary
of the bidder revokes, the bidder’s side scores all points it makes,
regardless of the number bid. For instance: A has bid nine;
and Y revokes. A-B make eight only, which they score, Y-Z scoring
nothing. When a player renounces, his partner should ask
him if he is void of the suit.</p>

<p>If any player abandons his hand, the cards in it may be exposed
and called by the adversaries. The practice of throwing down the
hand as soon as one renounces to trumps, cannot be too strongly
condemned.</p>

<p>All <i><b>exposed cards</b></i>, such as cards dropped on the table; two
or more played at once; cards led out of turn; or cards named by
the player holding them, must be left face up on the table, and are
liable to be called by the adversaries, unless they can be previously
got rid of in the course of play. If the exposed card is a trump,
the adversaries may prevent its being played, but the holder of it
is not liable for a revoke in such cases.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> When the last card has been played, each side
turns over all the tricks won, and counts the points they contain;
High, Low, Jack, Game, Right and Left Pedro. Everything, including
Low, counts to the side winning it. The number of
points won or lost is determined by deducting the lower score
from the higher, the difference being the number of points won on
that deal. If it is a tie, neither side scores. If either side has incurred
a penalty which prevents them from scoring any points
they may have won, the adversaries have nothing to deduct, and
score all they make.</p>

<p>If the side that named the trump fails to make as many points
as it bid, it scores nothing, and the number of points bid are
scored by the adversaries, in addition to any points that the adversaries
may have made in play. For instance: A-B are partners
against Y-Z. B has bid to make 8, and named hearts for trumps.
A-B make 10, which is 2 more than they bid, Y-Z getting the
other 4; which leaves A-B 6. These are scored by placing one
red and one white counter in the pool. But suppose A-B got only
5 points, Y-Z getting 9. A-B would score nothing, as they did
not make good their bid; while Y-Z would score the 9 points
actually won, and the 8 points bid in addition, or 17 altogether.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>The old way of scoring was to <i><b>set back</b></i> the side that failed to
make the number bid; but that system of counting entirely destroyed
the interest in the game when one side got much behind;
because it could not recover in time to prevent the other side from
<i><b>sweating out</b></i>, as it is called. Suppose A-B have been set back
18 points on two failures, Y-Z having made 16 points on those two
deals, and 23 on their own bids. The score will stand: A-B 64 to
go; Y-Z, 12 to go. Even if we suppose that A-B make 11 on
each of the next four deals, they will still have 20 to go, while
Y-Z will be out. Again: A-B want 15, Y-Z want 2. Even if
A-B can bid 12 and make it, Y-Z will sweat out.</p>

<p>With the system of scoring here recommended, this sweating
out is impossible, and it is not uncommon for a side that wants
one to go, to be beaten by an adversary that wants forty-nine.</p>

<p>The side first pegging out on a cribbage-board, or getting rid of
its fifty-one counters, wins the game. When the game is counted
on a pull-up cribbage marker, it is usual to start with ten up, and
peg out to the game-hole, or 61.</p>

<p><i><b>VARIATIONS.</b></i> There are quite a number of minor differences
in the manner of playing Cinch. Sometimes, instead of
discarding and drawing, after the successful bidder has been ascertained,
but before he names the trump, four more cards are
given to each player, including the dealer. Having seen thirteen
cards, the bidder names the trump suit, and the hands are then
reduced to six cards each. This method gives no clue to the number
of trumps originally held, and deprives the dealer of one of the
greatest advantages of his position, robbing the deck.</p>

<p>Another method is to discard and draw after the trump is
named, but to make the dealer take his cards from the top of the
pack to complete his hand, without seeing what he is to get. This
often leaves counting cards in the remainder of the pack, which
must remain face down, and be kept separate from the discards.
Such points count for neither side; but any points found among
the discards may be counted by the side making the trump, as in
the ordinary game. Owing to the uncertainty as to the number of
points actually in play, the result is controlled more largely by luck
than skill.</p>

<p>In some places the <i><b>first lead</b></i> from the successful bidder must
be a <i><b>trump</b></i>. This makes the game too much like Auction Pitch,
and spoils some of the finer points in leading.</p>

<p><i><b>Low</b></i> is sometimes counted for the person to whom it is dealt.
Such a rule causes endless confusion and disputes.</p>

<p>The old method of <i><b>scoring</b></i> has already been mentioned.
Another variation is that if the bidder’s side do not make at least
8 points they cannot score anything, no matter what they bid. If
both sides score 7, neither having bid more than 7, neither scores.
If one side bids 6, and makes 8, it scores 8; but the adversaries score
the 6 they make. If the side bidding 6 had made 6 only, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
score nothing, while their adversaries would mark the 8 they made.
The only good result of the 6 bid in this case is to prevent the adversaries
from scoring for a failure; for if 7 had been bid, and
only 6 made, the adversaries would have scored the 7 bid in addition
to the 8 they made, or 15 in all. This system, while better
than the old way, because it never sets players back, still allows
one side to sweat out; because if the bidder does not make 14,
the adversaries must count something every deal.</p>

<p><i><b>Five or six players</b></i>, each for himself, may play what is
called <i><b>Auction Cinch</b></i>, or <i><b>Razzle-dazzle</b></i>. Only six cards are
dealt to each player, three on the first round and three on the
second. Then the privilege of naming the trump suit is bid for
as usual. After the trump is named, superfluous cards are thrown
out, and others drawn in their place, restoring the hands to six
cards each. The successful bidder then calls upon the holder of
any given card to be his partner. The person holding the card
named cannot refuse, and says: “I play with you.” The partnership
thus formed plays against the combined forces of the other
players, but without changing seats. The maker of the trump
leads first, any card he pleases. For instance: A B C D E are
playing. C bids 8 and names clubs. After the draw he finds he
holds A J 10 5 2 of trumps. He calls for the club King as his
partner, and leads his Pedro at once for the King to take it in.
He is then certain to catch the other Pedro, or to save three of the
four points for High, Low, Jack, and the Game. Those who have
played Seven-handed Euchre will at once recognize the similarity
of the two games. Both are excellent round games for the family
circle.</p>

<p><i><b>Progressive Cinch</b></i> is played by dealing one round at each
table; that is, four deals, each player having the deal once only.
The ordinary game of Cinch is played, and the pair having the
fewest points to go at the end of the four deals progress to the
next higher table. Ties cut to decide, high going up. On arriving
at the next table, the partners divide, and another game of
four deals is played, the winning pair again progressing. The
general arrangements for the original positions of the players, and
the prizes to be given, are the same as in Progressive Euchre, and
have been fully described in connection with that game.</p>

<p><i><b>Blind Cinch.</b></i> Instead of giving each player thirteen cards at
once, the hands are dealt in two parts. First of all, nine cards are
dealt to each player, three at a time. Then four cards are dealt in
front of each player, but not to be touched until the bidding is
finished. The highest bidder takes up his four extra cards and
then names the trump, after which he discards down to six cards
for play. The others then take up their four cards and discard
down to six, and the game proceeds like regular cinch.</p>

<p><i><b>Sixty-three.</b></i> In this variation, nine cards are dealt to each
player, three at a time. After the bidding, the players discard and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
fill up again to six cards. Players are allowed several bids, each
raising in turn if he is raised. The highest bid possible is sixty-three,
and these may be made as follows: High, low, Jack, and ten
of trumps count 1 each; pedros, 5 each; King of trumps, 25; trey
of trumps, 15; nine of trumps, 9. Game is 150 points.</p>

<p><i><b>Widow Cinch.</b></i> Six players cut for partners, two on a side.
Each player has two adversaries between himself and his partner.
The dealer gives each player eight cards, four at a time, and four
are dealt to the table after the first round to the players. These
four cards are the widow. The successful bidder can take the
widow before he names the trump, and then all the players discard
down to six cards.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> There is a great
diversity of opinion on bidding. Some persons always bid six on
an ace, if they hold neither of the Pedroes. This is based on the
sound principle that the odds are five to four in favour of your
partner having one of the Pedroes, which he will immediately give
up if you lead the ace. The odds are five to two that your partner
will hold one or more of any three named counting cards
which you do not hold. If you have no Pedro, count on him for
one, and if you have King and Queen, you can risk his having a
guard to it, and bid as if you were sure of getting his Pedro home.
If you have none of the points for High, Low, Jack, or Game, or
only one of them, count on him for one at least, and bid accordingly.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to give exact rules for bidding, the state of the
score having much to do with it; but as a general rule it is much
better to bid on <i><b>catching cards</b></i> than on the points themselves.
For instance: A K Q of trumps should certainly be good for eight
points; some players habitually bid twelve on them, reckoning to
catch both Pedroes and one of the minor points. This is risky unless
there are one or two small trumps with the A K Q. On the
other hand, two Pedroes, with Jack and Low, are not worth bidding
more than five on; because it is very unlikely that you will
save more than one of the Pedroes, if that. The very fact that
you bid five diminishes your chances, for you betray the fact that
your only hope is to save a well-guarded Pedro. Long experience
with players who bid their hands correctly will give a player a very
good idea of what the bidder has in his hand. To the partner this
is a great point, for it enables him to judge when to give up points
himself, and when to play for his partner to throw them to him.</p>

<p>The number of cards asked for by each player should be very
carefully noted; for it will frequently happen that the entire trump
suit can be located by this means. It is useless to keep anything
but trumps, for tricks, as such, have no value, and every card you
draw increases your chances of getting another trump.</p>

<p>The most important point in the game is to <i><b>cinch</b></i> every trick in
which an adversary plays after you; that is, to play some trump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
higher than a Pedro, if the Pedroes have not been played, and you
do not hold them yourself. Examples of cinching will be found in
the Illustrative Hands. If your partner leads a certain winning
trump, such as the ace, or the King if the ace is gone, give him
the best counting card you have; but if you have two, one of
them being Low, give up the lower card first; you may catch
something with the Jack or Ten. If your partner leads any trump
higher than the Five, play your smallest trump unless second hand
covers, in which case you must cinch the trick, to prevent the
fourth hand from giving up a Pedro on his partner’s trick.</p>

<p>If you are forced to win your partner’s first lead of trumps, return
the best trump you have, unless it is the Jack or Ten, in which
case you must be guided by the number of points you are playing
for, and your chances of making them if you lose the card you
lead.</p>

<p>If your partner begins by leading a plain suit, you must cinch
the trick if you can; if second hand follows suit, any trump better
than the Five will do. If second hand puts on a trump, you must
cinch higher.</p>

<p>If the player on your right renounces to trumps, get into the
lead if possible, and play your best cards in plain suits. This may
give your partner a tenace position over the player on your left.</p>

<p>If partner begins with a high card in trumps, not the ace, credit
him with the sequence below it, and put in your Pedro at the first
opportunity. For instance: Partner leads King, won by the ace
second hand. Whatever this player leads, put in your Pedro, if
you have one, your partner must have Queen of trumps.</p>

<p>Playing to the score is very important. Do not attempt to get
more than the number bid until that is assured. On the other
hand, if it is certain that the adversary cannot make good his bid,
do not let him get as close to it as possible, but play boldly to win
all you can, for every point he makes is simply lost.</p>

<p>Here are a few example hands, which will give a very good idea
of some of the fine points in the game.</p>

<p><i><b>No. 1.</b></i> Y’s draw shows that he holds at least four trumps, so
A must trust his partner to cinch the first trick and return the
trump. [See our suggestions for good play.] At trick 3, Z cinches,
to make A play a high trump. It is evident to A that neither B
nor Z holds either Jack or Seven of trumps; so both those cards
must be with Y. As B has no more trumps the adversaries must
have both Pedroes, and Y must have one, as he holds four trumps.
If they are divided, A can catch both by cinching this trick with
the King and leading the Ace; but if Y has both Pedroes, such a
course would lose Jack, Game, and one Pedro. If A cinches this
trick with the Ten, allowing Y to win with the Jack, A must catch
both Pedroes, no matter how they lie, provided Y leads the trump
Seven, for A will refuse to win it.</p>

<p>Y sees his danger, and by leading a Pedro to A, forces him
either to pass it, or to get into the lead and free the other Pedro.</p>

<p>A-B score nothing: Y-Z score 7 for Jack, Game, Pedro; and 8
in addition, for points bid but not made by A-B; 15 altogether.</p>

<p><i><b>No. 2.</b></i> At trick 2, Y sees that he cannot save Low, and the
lead would be a great disadvantage, because either A has all the
remaining trumps, or Y’s partner has an unguarded Pedro. At
trick 3, A knows that if Y has Ace, and Z Pedro, A can still make
his bid by catching Jack, and saving his own Pedro. If the Pedro
was not with Z the small trump is still the best lead, for it puts the
lead on A’s left. B gets rid of cards which might get him into the
lead to his partner’s disadvantage. Unfortunately, Z is unable to
take the lead away from Y at trick 4. As Y is still in the lead,
there is no necessity for A to save his Pedro, for Y cannot possibly
catch it, and A must catch Y’s, no matter how Y plays.</p>

<p>A-B score 10 points; Low, Game, and both Pedroes, 12, from
which they deduct the 2 points made by Y-Z.</p>

<p><i><b>No. 3.</b></i> At the second trick, A knows that his partner still
holds another trump, because he drew only three cards. This
trump must be the 9. Z holds two more trumps, and they must
be the Jack and Right Pedro, because Z would not throw away
Game if he had anything smaller. The 7 must be with Y, and if A
now leads trump Queen, he will leave the Pedro good over his
Deuce, leaving him only 8 points, whereas he has bid 12. If A
leads the Deuce, his partner’s nine will cinch the trick, and Z can
make only the Jack.</p>

<p>A-B score 10. The 12 actually taken make good the bid; but
the 2 points won by the adversaries must be deducted, leaving 10
to be scored by A-B.</p>

<p><i><b>No. 4.</b></i> At the third trick, a hasty or careless player would
have been only too glad of the opportunity to get in his Pedro.
But Y reasons that there are only two trumps unaccounted for, the
Ten and Left Pedro. If B has one, it must fall to this trick. He
cannot have both, for A drew only two cards. If A has both, Y
must catch his Pedro, no matter how A plays; and as long as Y
does not get into the lead himself, he cannot lose his own Pedro.
At trick 5, A naturally places the Pedro with Z, as Y did not save
it on the King, and it is perfectly natural for A to trump with his
Pedro, intending to lead the Ten to catch Z’s.</p>

<p>A-B score nothing, not having made good their bid. Y-Z score
Right and Left Pedro, and Low, 11 points; adding the 8 points bid
but not made by A-B, 19 altogether.</p>

<h4>CINCH LAWS.</h4>

<p><i><b>Formation of Table.</b></i> A cinch table is complete with six
players. If more than four assemble, they cut for preference, the
four highest playing the first game. Partners and deal are then
cut for, the two lowest pairing against the two highest. Partners
sit opposite each other. The highest deals, and has the choice
of seats and cards. The Ace is high, both in cutting and in play.
A player exposing more than one card must cut again.</p>

<p><i><b>Ties.</b></i> If the first cut does not decide, the players cutting equal
cards cut again; but the new cut decides nothing but the tie.</p>

<p><i><b>Cutting Out.</b></i> At the end of the game, the players cut to decide
which shall give way to those awaiting their turn to play, the
lowest cuts going out. After the second game, those who have
played the greatest number of consecutive games give way, ties
being decided by cutting.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> Every player has the right to shuffle the cards, the
dealer last. The dealer must present the pack to the pone to be
cut. At least four cards must be left in each packet. If a card<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
is exposed in cutting, the pack must be reshuffled, and cut again.
If the dealer reshuffles the pack after it has been properly cut,
he loses his deal.</p>

<p>Beginning on his left, the dealer must give to each player in
rotation three cards at a time for three rounds. No trump is
turned. The deal passes to the left.</p>

<p>There must be a new deal by the same dealer if any card is
found faced in the pack; or if the pack is proved incorrect or imperfect;
but any previous cutting or scores made with the imperfect
pack stand good.</p>

<p>The adversaries may demand a new deal if any card is exposed
during the deal, provided they have not touched a card. If an
adversary exposes a card, the dealer may elect to deal again. If
a new deal is not demanded, cards exposed in dealing cannot be
called.</p>

<p>The adversaries may stop a player dealing out of turn, or with
the wrong pack, provided they do so before the last three cards
are dealt, alter which the deal stands good.</p>

<p><i><b>Misdealing.</b></i> A misdeal loses the deal. It is a misdeal: If
the cards have not been properly cut, if the dealer does not give
the same number of cards to each player on the same round; if he
gives too many or too few cards to any player; if he counts the
cards on the table, or those remaining in the pack; or if he deals
a card incorrectly, and fails to correct the error before dealing
another. If the dealer is interrupted in any way by an adversary,
he does not lose his deal.</p>

<p><i><b>Bidding.</b></i> After receiving his nine cards, each player in turn,
beginning on the dealer’s left, announces the number of points he
will undertake to win if he is allowed to name the trump suit. No
player is allowed to bid more than fourteen. If he will not bid, he
must say: “I pass.” A bid having been regularly made, any
following player must bid higher or pass. There are no second
bids. A bid once made can neither be amended nor withdrawn.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregular Bids.</b></i> If any player bids before the eldest hand
has bid or passed, both the player in error and his partner lose
their right to bid; but the side not in error must bid to decide
which of them shall name the trump. If the eldest hand has decided,
and the pone bids without waiting for the dealer’s partner,
the pone loses his bid, and the dealer may bid before his partner.
If the dealer bids without waiting for his partner, both lose their
bids; but the pone may overbid the eldest hand.</p>

<p>If the dealer’s partner has bid, and the dealer bids without waiting
for the pone, the dealer loses his bid.</p>

<p>If a player whose partner has not yet bid names the trump suit,
his partner loses his bid.</p>

<p>If a player bids with more than nine cards in his hand, his bid is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
lost, and the adversaries must draw the superfluous cards from his
hand, face down, placing them about the middle of the undealt
portion of the pack.</p>

<p>If no bid is made, the dealer may name any trump he pleases,
without bidding.</p>

<p>If any player exposes any of his cards before the trump suit is
named, the adversaries may elect to have a new deal by the same
dealer.</p>

<p><i><b>Discarding.</b></i> The trump named, each player must put out at
least three of his cards, and may discard as many more as he
pleases. All such discards must be placed on the table face up.
Should a player discard a trump, his partner may call his attention
to it, and it may be taken back, provided the player has not been
helped to cards, or has not lifted the cards drawn.</p>

<p><i><b>Drawing.</b></i> The players having discarded, the dealer, beginning
on his left, must give to each in turn from the top of the
pack, face down, as many cards as may be necessary to restore
the number in each hand to six.</p>

<p><i><b>Robbing the Deck.</b></i> When it comes to the dealer’s turn to
draw cards, instead of taking them from the top of the pack, face
down, he may search the remainder of the pack, and take from it
any cards he pleases to restore the number in his hand to six.
Should he find in his own hand and in the remainder of the pack,
more than six trumps, he must discard those he does not want,
face upward on the table.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregular Drawing.</b></i> Should a player ask for too many or
too few cards, and not discover his error until the next player has
been helped, if he has too few he may make his hand good from
the discards, but must not take a trump therefrom. If he has too
many, the adversaries must be allowed to draw the superfluous
ones at random, face down, placing them on the top of the pack.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing.</b></i> The maker of the trump must lead for the first
trick, any card he pleases. If a trump is led, all must follow suit
if able. If a plain suit is led, a player may trump, even when
holding a card of the suit led; but if he does not trump he must
follow suit if he can, or he is liable to the penalty for a revoke.</p>

<p>The last trick turned and quitted may be seen, but no other.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in the Hands.</b></i> If any player is found to
have an incorrect number of cards, it is a misdeal if no bid has
been made. If a bid has been made, the deal stands good if three
players have their right number of cards. If the first trick has
been played to by a person holding too many cards, neither he nor
his partner can score anything that hand; but they may play the
hand out to save what points they can. If a player has too few
cards, there is no penalty, but he should draw from the discard to
make up the deficiency, plain-suit cards only being available.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Exposed Cards.</b></i> The following are exposed cards, which
must be left face up on the table, and are liable to be called by either
adversary: 1. Every card faced upon the table otherwise than in
the regular course of play. 2. Two or more cards played to a
trick; the adversaries may elect which shall be played. 3. Any
card named by the player holding it.</p>

<p>The adversary on the right of an exposed card must call it before
he plays himself. If it will be the turn of the player holding
the exposed card to lead for the next trick, the card, if wanted,
must be called before the current trick is turned and quitted.
Should a player having the lead, and an exposed card in front of
him, play before the previous trick is turned and quitted, the card
so led may also be claimed as exposed.</p>

<p>If a trump is exposed after the trump suit has been named, the
adversaries may prevent the playing of such a card; but the holder
of it is not liable to any penalty for a revoke under such circumstances.</p>

<p><i><b>Leading Out of Turn.</b></i> If a player leads when it was his
partner’s turn, the partner may be called upon by his right-hand
adversary to lead or not to lead a trump; but a specified plain
suit cannot be called. If it was the turn of neither of the side in
error to lead, the card played in error is simply exposed. If all
have played to the false lead, the error cannot be rectified. If all
have not followed, the cards played to the false lead may be taken
back, and are not liable to be called.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing Out of Turn.</b></i> If the third hand plays before the
second, the fourth may play before the second also; either of his
own volition, or by the direction of the second hand, who may say:
“Play, partner.” If the fourth hand plays before the second, the
third hand not having played, the trick may be claimed by the adversaries,
no matter who actually wins it; but the actual winner of
it must lead for the next trick.</p>

<p>If any player abandons his hand, the cards in it may be claimed
as exposed, and called by the adversaries.</p>

<p><i><b>The Revoke.</b></i> A revoke is a renounce in error, not corrected
in time, or non-compliance with a performable penalty. It is a
revoke if a player has one of the suit led, and neither follows suit
nor trumps.</p>

<p>A person prohibited from playing an exposed trump is not
liable to any penalty if it causes him to revoke.</p>

<p>A revoke is established when the trick in which it occurs has
been turned and quitted; or when either the revoking player or
his partner, whether in his right turn or otherwise, has led or
played to the following trick.</p>

<p>If a revoke is claimed and proved, the revoking side cannot
score any points that deal; but they may play the hand out to
prevent the adversaries from making points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>If an adversary of the bidder revokes, the bidder’s side scores
whatever points it makes that deal, regardless of the number bid.</p>

<p>A player may ask his partner whether or not he has a card of
the suit in which he renounces and does not trump, and the player
may correct his error if the question is asked before the trick is
turned and quitted. But if he answers in the negative, there is no
remedy.</p>

<p><i><b>Drawing Cards.</b></i> Any player may ask the others to indicate
the cards played by them to the current trick; but he must confine
himself to the expression: “Draw cards.”</p>

<p><i><b>Irregular Remarks.</b></i> A player calling attention in any
manner to the trick or to the score, may be called upon to play
his highest or lowest of the suit led; or to trump or not to trump
the trick during the play of which the remark is made.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> A game consists of fifty-one points; fourteen of
which must be made on every deal, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1 for <i><b>High</b></i>, or the Ace of trumps.</p>

<p>1 for <i><b>Low</b></i>, or the Deuce of trumps.</p>

<p>1 for the <i><b>Jack</b></i> of trumps.</p>

<p>1 for <i><b>Game</b></i>, or the Ten of trumps.</p>

<p>5 for <i><b>Right Pedro</b></i>, or the Five of trumps.</p>

<p>5 for <i><b>Left Pedro</b></i>, or Five of the same colour as the trump
suit. All points count to the side winning them.</p>

<p>Any trumps found among the discards at the end of the hand
count for the side that made the trump.</p>

<p>At the end of the hand, the number of points won by each side
is added up, and the lower deducted from the higher, the difference
being scored by the winners of the majority. If the result is
a tie, neither scores. For instance: If A-B make 11, Y-Z must
make the remaining 3, which deducted from 11 leaves 8 points for
A-B to score.</p>

<p>If the side naming the trump suit fails to make as many points
as they bid, they score nothing for that deal, and the number bid
is scored by the adversaries, in addition to any other points that
the adversaries may have made in play. The number bid and the
number actually won, must be compared before deducting the
points made by the adversaries.</p>

<p>The side first making fifty-one points wins the game.</p>

<h2 id="HEARTS">HEARTS.</h2>

<p>Hearts is supposed by some persons to be an entirely new
game; but its leading principle, losing instead of winning tricks,
is to be found in many other card games, some of which are quite
old. Slobberhannes, Enflé, Schwellen, Polignac, and The Four
Jacks, all belong to the same family, but most of them have given
way to the more popular game of Hearts.</p>

<p>There are several varieties of Hearts, but the principal arrangements
are the same in all, and the chief differences are in the manner
of settling at the end of the hand.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Hearts is played with a full pack of fifty-two cards,
which rank A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2: the ace is the highest in
play, but in cutting it ranks below the deuce. There is no trump
suit.</p>

<p>When three persons play, the deuce of spades is thrown out of
the pack; when five play, both the black deuces are laid aside,
and when six play, all four deuces are discarded. It is usual to
play with two packs, one being shuffled while the other is dealt.</p>

<p><i><b>COUNTERS.</b></i> Every deal is a game in itself, and must be
settled for in counters immediately. It is usual for each player to
begin with fifty counters, which are purchased from some person
who is agreed upon to act as banker. When only two play, the
game may be scored on a pull-up cribbage board, and settled for
at the end.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Any number from two to six persons may play,
but four is the usual number, each playing for himself against all
the others. The players on the dealer’s right and left are known
as the <i><b>pone</b></i> and the <i><b>eldest hand</b></i>, respectively.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> The value of the counters must be agreed upon
before play begins, and the method of settling should also be understood,
Sweepstake Hearts and Howell’s Settling being entirely
different games, and requiring totally different methods of play.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> If seven players assemble, it is usual to make
up a table in which the dealer takes no cards. If there are more
than seven candidates for play, two tables must be formed.</p>

<p>Players draw from an outspread pack for the choice of seats and
cards, the lowest cut having the first choice, and the others following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
in their order. The player cutting the lowest card takes
the first deal, which afterward passes in regular rotation to the
left.</p>

<p>In cutting, the ace is low. Any player exposing more than one
card must cut again.</p>

<p><i><b>TIES.</b></i> If the first cut does not decide, those tying must cut
again, but the new cut decides nothing but the tie.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> Any player has the right to shuffle the pack,
the dealer last. The cards are then presented to the pone to be
cut, who must leave at least four in each packet. The cards are
dealt from left to right, one at a time to each player in rotation
until the pack is exhausted. No trump is turned. In Two-handed
Hearts, the dealer stops when each player has received
thirteen cards. The deal passes to the left.</p>

<p><i><b>Misdealing.</b></i> It is a misdeal if the dealer omits to have the
pack cut, and the error is discovered before the last card is dealt;
if he deals a card incorrectly, and does not remedy the error before
dealing another; or if he counts the cards on the table, or
those remaining in the pack; or if it is discovered before all have
played to the first trick that any player has too many or too few
cards. A misdeal loses the deal unless one of the other players
has touched the cards, or has in any way interrupted the dealer.</p>

<p>If any card is exposed by the dealer, the player to whom it is
dealt may demand a new deal, provided he has not touched any
of his cards. Any one dealing out of turn, or with the wrong
cards, may be stopped before the last card is dealt. After that the
deal stands good, and the packs, if changed, must so remain.</p>

<p><i><b>IRREGULAR HANDS.</b></i> If, after the first trick has been
played to, any two players are found to have more or less than
their correct number of cards, the pack being perfect, the one having
less must draw, face downward, from the hand of the one having
more; and each must pay five counters into the pool.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> As a general proposition,
the object of each player is to avoid getting any hearts in the
tricks he takes in. In some varieties of the game his object must
be to take no hearts; in others it will be to take less than his adversaries;
while in others it will be to take less than four. After
a person has taken in one or more hearts, his object will be to
<i><b>load</b></i> the others; that is, to see that they get some hearts also; or
it may be to see that a given player takes at least one heart; or
that no one but himself takes any. The manner in which a person
must vary his play in accordance with these different objects will
be discussed when we come to the suggestions for good play. In
the meantime, it is necessary to bear in mind only the general
principle that the object of the game is to avoid winning any tricks
that contain hearts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The cards dealt, the player
to the left of the dealer begins by leading any card he pleases, and
the others must follow suit if they can. The highest card played,
if of the suit led, wins the trick. There is no trump suit. If a
player has none of the suit led, he may discard anything he
pleases. The winner of the trick takes it in and leads for the next
trick, and so on until all the cards have been played. The tricks
themselves have no value as such, and need not be kept separate.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in Play.</b></i> If any player omits to play to a trick,
and plays to a following one, he is not allowed to correct his error,
but is compelled to take the thirteenth or last trick, with whatever
hearts it may contain. If a player is found, during or at the end of
a hand, to be a card short, all others at the table having their right
number, and all having played to the first trick, the player with the
short hand is compelled to take the last trick, with whatever
hearts it may contain.</p>

<p><i><b>Exposed Cards.</b></i> Should a person lead or play two cards to
one trick, he is allowed to indicate the one intended; but he must
leave the other face upward on the table. All exposed cards are
liable to be called by any player at the table, and should one
player call such a card, his decision is binding on the others. A
player with an exposed card in front of him must play it when
called upon, provided he can do so without revoking; but he cannot
be prevented from getting rid of the exposed card in the
course of play, if the opportunity offers.</p>

<p><i><b>Leading Out of Turn.</b></i> Should a player lead out of turn, he
may be called upon to lead or not to lead a heart when it is next
his turn to lead. This penalty can be enforced only by the player
on his right. If all have played to the false lead the error cannot
be rectified; but if all have not played, their cards must be taken
back, and are not liable to be called.</p>

<p>If any person plays out of turn in any trick, the player on his
left, not having played, may demand that the card be taken back,
and after the proper player has played the player in error may be
called upon to play his highest or lowest of the suit led, or not to
discard a heart. If the person on the left of the player in error
was the leader in the trick, either he or the player whose proper
turn it was to play may demand the penalty.</p>

<p><i><b>Revoking.</b></i> Any player failing to follow suit, when able to do
so, may amend his error if he discovers his mistake before the
trick in which it occurs has been turned and quitted. The card
played in error then becomes an exposed card. Those who have
played after him have the privilege of withdrawing their cards and
substituting others, without penalty. Should the revoking player
not discover his error in time, the hand must be played out, and if
the revoke is detected and claimed the player in error must pay all
the losses on that hand. Should the revoking player win the pool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
himself, he must pay the thirteen counters to the pool, and leave
them for a <i><b>Jack</b></i>. Should he divide the pool with another player,
he must pay his co-winner six counters, and put up the other seven
for a Jack.</p>

<p>If two or more players revoke in the same hand, each must pay
the entire losses in that hand as if he were alone in error; so that
if two should revoke and a third win the pool, the latter would receive
twenty-six counters instead of thirteen. In Auction Hearts,
the revoking player must also refund the amount put up by the
bidder. A revoke must be claimed and proved before the pool is
divided. Non-compliance with a performable penalty is the same
as a revoke.</p>

<p><i><b>SETTLING.</b></i> After the last card has been played, each
player turns over his tricks, counts the number of hearts he has
taken in, and announces it. Players should be careful not to
gather or mix the cards until all thirteen hearts have been accounted
for. Each player then pays into the pool for the number
of hearts he has taken in, according to the system of settlement
agreed upon before play began. The pool is then taken down by
the player or players winning it, and the deal passes to the left.
The game is at an end any time the players wish to stop, after a
hand has been settled for; but it is usual to agree upon some definite
hour.</p>

<p>There are two ways of settling at the end of the hand, each of
which has its good points.</p>

<p><i><b>SWEEPSTAKE HEARTS.</b></i> After the hand has been
played, each player announces the number of hearts he has taken
in, and pays into the pool one counter for each. All thirteen
hearts having been paid for, any player having taken no hearts
wins the entire pool; two having taken none, divide it. If all the
players have taken hearts, or if one player has taken all thirteen,
the pool remains, and forms a <i><b>Jack</b></i>. This can be won only by a
single player in some subsequent deal taking no hearts, all the
others having taken at least one. These jack pools are of course
increased thirteen counters every deal until some player wins the
whole amount. Some clubs make it a Jack after two players have
divided a pool, using the odd counter as a starter. It will be
found that natural Jacks occur quite frequently enough without resorting
to this expedient.</p>

<p><i><b>HOWELL’S SETTLING.</b></i> The great objection to the
method of settling at Sweepstake Hearts is that it makes the game
almost entirely one of chance. No matter how good a player one
may be, good luck alone will bring success. In a four-handed
game it is possible for one player to take in only 58 hearts in 60
deals, and still to be 46 counters behind; while another player may
take in 500 hearts in 60 deals and be 46 counters ahead. It may
be claimed that the player who has 46 counters ahead at the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
was the better player, because he won; but most persons will agree
that a player who takes in only 58 hearts in 60 deals is a much better
player than one who has taken in 500 hearts in the same time.</p>

<p>It was to remedy this defect, and to give skill its proper percentage
of value, that Mr. E. C. Howell of Boston proposed the manner
of contributing to and dividing the pools which is now known
as Howell’s Settling.</p>

<p>Each player begins with an equal number of counters, usually
100. At the end of the hand, after the hearts have been counted
and announced, each player pays into the pool, for every heart he
holds, as many counters as there are players besides himself.
For instance: A, B, C and D play. A takes three hearts; B
and C five each, and D none. There being three players besides
himself, A puts up three times three, or 9 counters. B and C put
up 15 each, and D none; so that there are 39 in the pool. Each
player then takes out of the pool 1 counter for every heart he did
<i><b>not</b></i> hold when the hearts were announced. D, having taken no
hearts, gets 13 counters. A, having taken three hearts only, is
entitled to 10 counters for the 10 hearts he did not hold, while B
and C get 8 each. This exhausts the pool. There are no Jacks
in this way of settling.</p>

<p>Matters may be facilitated by having counters of different colours,
the white being the unit, and the red representing the number
which it will be necessary to pay for one heart. Practice will
make the players so familiar with the amount of the various profits
or losses that they simply pay or take what is due to them.</p>

<p>The first time this is played it looks like a pretty severe game
for a player who takes in a large number of hearts on one deal;
but it will be found that he rapidly recovers. During a sitting of
any length the player who takes in the smallest number of hearts
must be the winner. In the case mentioned in connection with
Sweepstake Hearts, in which one player lost 46 counters while
another won 46, in 60 deals, the result at Howell’s Settling would
have been that the player who took in only 58 hearts would be 548
counters ahead instead of losing 46; while the one who took in
500 hearts would lose 1220 counters, instead of winning 46.</p>

<p><i><b>METHODS OF CHEATING.</b></i> Under the rule for dealing
the cards one at a time, the greek must be very skilful to secure
any advantage at Hearts. But when it is the practice to deal
the cards three at a time, and four on the last round, it is an easy
matter to get four small hearts together on the bottom of the pack.
Any person who is observed to hold three or four small hearts
every time he deals, should be carefully watched, and it will usually
be found that he gathers the small hearts from the hands of the
other players while the pool is being divided. Marked cards are
of little use to the greek at hearts, because so much depends on
what a player holds, and so little on his play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<h3>VARIETIES OF HEARTS.</h3>

<p>Before proceeding to suggestions for good play, it will be better
to describe some of the variations of the game in common use,
because what would be good play in one variation would not be in
another.</p>

<p><i><b>TWO-HANDED HEARTS.</b></i> The two players having cut
for the deal, thirteen cards are given to each, one at a time, and the
remainder of the pack is left on the table, face down. The dealer’s
adversary, usually called the pone, begins by leading any card
he pleases, and the dealer must follow suit if he can, as in the ordinary
game. The winner of the trick takes it in, but before leading
for the next trick he draws one card from the top of the pack
lying on the table, restoring the number of his cards to thirteen.
His adversary then draws the next card, and the cards are played
and drawn in this manner until the pack is exhausted. The thirteen
cards remaining in the hands of the two adversaries are then
played, and after the last trick has been won, each turns over his
cards and counts the number of hearts he has taken in. The object
of the game is to take fewer hearts than your opponent, and
the method of settling is either for the greater number to pay the
lesser the difference; or, for the first six hearts taken by the loser
to count nothing, but all above six to be paid for. The most popular
way is to peg up the difference on a cribbage board, and to
settle at the end of the sitting.</p>

<p><i><b>THREE-HANDED HEARTS.</b></i> The deuce of spades is
discarded, and seventeen cards are dealt to each player, one at a
time, after which the game proceeds in the usual way. There are
several methods of settling. Howell’s method is undoubtedly the
best, but Sweepstakes is very common. An excellent way is for
the player who takes the largest number of hearts to pay the two
others as many counters as he has hearts in excess of theirs. If
two have an equal number, both pay the low man. There are no
Jacks.</p>

<p><i><b>AUCTION HEARTS.</b></i> This is usually played by four persons,
although five or six may form a table. After the cards have
been dealt in the usual way, the player to the left of the dealer examines
his cards, and determines which suit he would prefer to
play to get clear of. It may be that if the game were to get rid
of clubs instead of hearts, his hand would be a very good one,
whereas if the suit were to remain hearts it would be a very bad
hand. As the pool will contain thirteen counters to a certainty,
he can afford to pay something for the better chance he will have
to win it if he is allowed to make clubs the suit to be avoided, instead
of hearts. He bids whatever amount he is willing to pay for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
the privilege of changing the suit, without naming the suit he prefers.
The next player then has a bid, and so on in turn, the
dealer bidding last. There are no second bids.</p>

<p>The player making the highest bid pays into the pool the amount
he has bid. He then names the suit to be avoided, and leads for
the first trick, regardless of his position with respect to the deal.
The dealer’s position is a great advantage, on account of its having
the last bid.</p>

<p>After the hand is played, those who have taken in any cards of
the suit announced to be avoided, pay one counter to the pool for
each of them. If any one player gets clear, each of the others
having at least one of the tabooed suit, he takes the entire pool.
If two get clear, they divide the pool, leaving any odd counter to
form the basis of a Jack, as at Sweepstakes. If one player takes
all thirteen, it is a Jack; but instead of the next choice being sold
to the highest bidder, the one who named the suit on the hand
that made the pool a Jack has the choice of suits again for the
next deal, and he must select some suit without paying anything
further for it, until some player wins what he paid for the choice
in the first place. That is, the pool must be won before the choice
can be sold again.</p>

<p>The general principle of the game is for the players to combine
against the successful bidder, and to spare no effort to prevent him
from winning the pool.</p>

<p><i><b>SPOT HEARTS.</b></i> In this variation, when the hearts are
announced at the end of the hand, the spots on them are the units
of value, the Jack being worth 11, the Queen 12, the King 13, and
the Ace 14. This adds nothing to the interest or skill of the
game; but rather tends to create confusion and delay, owing to
the numerous disputes as to the correctness of the count.</p>

<p>The total to be accounted for in each deal is 104. In settling,
the player with the smallest number collects from each of the others
the amount they have in excess of his. If two or more players
have an equal number, or none at all, they divide the amount collected
from each of the others. For instance: Four play, A has 8
points, B 24, C 18, and D 54. As 8 points is the lowest, B pays
A 16, C pays him 10, and D pays him 46. If A and B had 8 each,
C 32, and D 56, C would pay 24, and D 48; and A-B would divide
the amount between them.</p>

<p>The chief variation in play arises from the fact that one who
must win a heart trick cannot always afford to play his highest
heart as in the ordinary game.</p>

<p><i><b>JOKER HEARTS.</b></i> In this variation, the heart deuce is
discarded, and the Joker takes its place. The Joker occupies a
position between the Jack and the Ten in value, with the added
peculiarity that it cannot be discarded on a plain suit; for if it is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
it wins the trick unless there is a higher heart in the same trick.
If a player has the Joker dealt to him, his only chance to get rid of
it is to play it on a trick in which hearts are led, or to discard it on
a plain suit on which some other player has already discarded a
higher heart than the Ten. Under such circumstances, the
holder of the Joker is allowed to discard it, even if he has one of
the suit led, and the Joker being in the trick compels the player
who discarded the higher heart to take it in.</p>

<p>In settling, the Joker is worth five counters. If the player to
whom it was dealt takes it in, he pays these five counters to the
pool. If another player gets the Joker, he must pay the five
counters to the player who got rid of it. The remainder of the
pool is then divided in the usual way. This is a most exasperating
game.</p>

<p><i><b>DISCARD HEARTS.</b></i> This is sometimes called <i><b>Black
Jack</b></i>, or <i><b>Black Lady</b></i>. If it is the Jack, it is worth ten hearts;
if it is the Queen, it is worth thirteen hearts.</p>

<p>After the cards are dealt, each player in turn lays out three cards
which he does not want, and the player on his left is obliged to
take them, after having discarded himself. No player may look at
what he is going to get until he has discarded himself.</p>

<p>The Black Jack or Lady holds its rank as a spade when spades
are led; but the moment any other suit is led, of which the player is
void, he can discard the Black Jack or Lady, just as he would get
rid of a heart. If hearts are led and the player has no hearts, he
can play the Black Jack or Lady to the trick, as it ranks below the
deuce of hearts.</p>

<p><i><b>PROGRESSIVE HEARTS.</b></i> The general arrangements
for the players and their positions are exactly the same as those
already described in connection with Progressive Euchre. The
players at each table cut for the deal, and play begins with the
tap of the bell at the head table. Only one deal is played at each
table.</p>

<p>There are no counters. At the end of the hand the ladies compare
their cards, and the one having the fewer hearts goes to the
next higher table. The gentlemen then compare their cards in
the same way, so that one lady and one gentleman go up from
each table at the end of every hand. They take the seats vacated
by those leaving the table they go to. All ties are determined by
cutting, those cutting the lower cards going up. In cutting, the
ace is low.</p>

<p>Each player is provided with a score card, to which the gold,
red and green stars are attached as in Euchre. The gold stars
are given to those at the head table who have the fewest hearts.
Those moving from other tables receive red stars; and those taking
in the most hearts at the booby table receive green stars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Prizes are given to the ladies and gentlemen having the greatest
number of each variety of star; but the same player cannot win
two prizes. If there is a tie in one class, the number of other stars
must decide; equal numbers of gold being decided by the majority
of red on the same card; red ties, by the greater number of
gold; and green ties by the fewest number of gold stars.</p>

<p><i><b>HEARTSETTE.</b></i> Heartsette differs from hearts only in the
addition of a widow. When four play, the spade deuce is deleted;
twelve cards are given to each player, and the three remaining
form the widow, which is left face downward in the centre of the
table. When any other number play, the full pack is used. If
there are three players, three cards are left for the widow: two
cards are left when five play, and four when six play. The player
winning the first trick takes in the widow, with any hearts it may
contain. He is entitled to look at these cards, but must not show
or name them to any other player. The game then proceeds in
the usual way. Payments are made to the pool for all hearts
taken in, and the pool is then won, divided, or remains to form a
Jack, just as at Sweepstake Hearts. The chief difference in the
game is that the other players do not know whether the winner of
the first trick is loaded or not, and he is the only player who knows
how many or what hearts are still to be played.</p>

<p><i><b>DOMINO HEARTS.</b></i> In this variation, six cards only are
dealt to each player, the remainder of the pack being left face
down on the table. When a player is unable to follow suit, he
must draw cards from the stock, one at a time, until he can. The
last player with any cards left in his hand must take what is left of
the stock, if any. The hearts taken in are then counted as usual.
Thirty-one points is game, and the winner is the player who has
the least hearts scored when some other player reaches thirty-one.</p>

<h3>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</h3>

<p>A good player, after sorting his hand, carefully estimates its
possibilities. The hand may be such that it is evidently impossible
to avoid taking some hearts. The player must then decide
whether he will play to give each of the others hearts, or will take
them all himself. If he succeeds in either object he has a chance
to win back his money in the ensuing Jack. In deciding on his
chances to get clear without taking a single heart, the player must
first consider the advisability of beginning with a heart, or with a
plain suit. If hearts, he should know the probability of the heart
he leads not winning the trick; if a plain suit, he should know the
probability of the suit going round one or more times without
hearts being discarded on it, especially if he intends to lead high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
cards. These chances must then be balanced one against the
other and the more favourable selected.</p>

<p><i><b>LEADING HEARTS ORIGINALLY.</b></i> When your
hearts are so small as to be absolutely safe, such as the 7 5 3 2, it
might be supposed that the best play would be to lead them at
once, in order to get a large number of hearts out of your way.
But with such cards it is usually much better play, unless you have
a very dangerous hand in plain suits, to reserve these small hearts
until you have a more definite idea, from the fall of the cards, to
whom you are giving them. Such cards are particularly useful for
getting rid of the lead at dangerous stages in the end-game.</p>

<p>When the plain-suit cards are high or dangerous, but the hearts
are reasonably safe, it is usually better to lead the hearts, and to
continue leading them every time you get in. By following these
tactics it is quite possible for you to take almost every trick in the
plain suits, and yet to win the pool by rapidly exhausting the
hearts.</p>

<p>If you lead the ♡ 4, the only chance for it to win is that one
player has no hearts, and that the 2 and 3 are divided. The odds
against this combination of circumstances will vary with the number
of hearts you hold with the 4, but may be generally stated on
the average as about 50 to 1. It is usually considered a safer lead
than a high card of a plain suit, even if you have only three of the
suit.</p>

<p>If your only heart is the 5, and you propose to lead it, the
chances that the 2, 3, and 4 are not each in separate hands are
about 19 in 25, or 19 to 6 against it, which is about 3 to 1. If you
lead the 5, the odds against your winning the trick decrease as the
number of hearts you hold with the 5 increases. If you have four
hearts, the 5 being the lowest, the odds against its winning the
trick, if you lead it, are about 29 to 11. If you have eight hearts,
the 5 being the lowest, it is about an even chance. If your only
heart is the 6, it is about an even chance that it will win the trick;
but the odds against you increase rapidly with the number of additional
hearts that you hold. If you propose to lead the 7, the
chances that it will win the trick are 2 to 1 under the most favourable
circumstances, which are when it is your only heart. These
odds against you increase rapidly with the number of additional
hearts that you hold.</p>

<p><i><b>LEADING PLAIN SUITS ORIGINALLY.</b></i> It will
often happen that you will have to decide between the lead of a
comparatively dangerous heart and a risky plain suit. Your knowledge
of probabilities should enable you to select the safer course.
The odds against getting a heart on the first round of a plain suit
depend upon how many cards of the suit you hold. If you lead
an Ace, or any card which is sure to win the trick, the odds against
your getting a heart on it are as the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<table summary="The odds">
  <tr>
    <td>If you have</td>
    <td class="tdr">4</td>
    <td>cards of the suit,</td>
    <td class="tdr">22 to 1.</td>

    <td class="tdr">8</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
    <td class="tdr">2 to 1.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>These odds may be slightly increased by taking into account
the fact that players who cannot follow suit do not always discard
hearts, having perhaps more dangerous cards to get rid of.</p>

<p>The odds against a suit going round a second time may be influenced
by the cards played to the first round; but it sometimes
happens that you have to calculate in advance for two rounds of a
suit, regardless of the cards that may be played by others. This
is especially the case when you fear that the suit will be led to
you, and you have such cards as must win two rounds. If you
have 4 cards of the suit the odds <i>against</i> your getting a heart in
two rounds are 2 to 1. The odds <i>in favour</i> of your getting a
heart in two rounds are:&mdash;</p>

<p>As an example of the value of a thorough knowledge of these
odds to a careful player, suppose he had to win two rounds of a
plain suit, of which he held six cards; or to lead the ♡7, having
three higher. The suit would be the better play, because it takes
in only one heart, while the lead of the heart might take in four.</p>

<p>The following table shows the exact number of times in 1,000
deals that a heart would probably be discarded on a plain suit led,
according to the number of cards in the suit held by the leader,

<p>This shows that 158 times in 1,000, when the leader has 1, 2, 3,
or 4 cards of the suit, it will go round three times, because 158 is
the balance necessary to bring our last figure, 842, up to 1,000.
Reducing this to a small fraction, the odds are about 5⅛ to 1 that
a suit will not go round three times without affording to some
player the chance of discarding hearts on it. This calculation
shows the hopeless nature of all hands that contain at least three
cards of each suit, unless the smallest card in every suit is below a
6; for if any one of the suits is led three times, it is even betting
that you will have to win the third round, and 5⅛ to 1 that you get
a heart on it if you do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>PLAIN-SUIT LEADS.</b></i> The favourite lead with most
heart players is a singleton; or, failing that, a two-card suit.
This is a mistake, unless the singleton is a high card; for if the
adversaries are sharp players they will at once suspect the nature
of the lead, and carefully avoid the suit. But if you wait until
some other player opens the suit, it will very probably be led twice
in succession. The best original plain-suit lead is one in which
you are moderately long, but have small cards enough to be safe,
and from which you can lead intermediate cards which probably
will not win the first trick.</p>

<p>A very little experience at Hearts will convince any one that it
is best, in plain suits, to play out the high cards first. This agrees
with the theory of probabilities; for while the odds are 22 to 1
against your getting a heart on the first round of a plain suit of
which you have 4 cards, the odds are only 2 to 1 against it on the
second round, and on the third they are 5⅛ to 1 in favour of it.
Accordingly, on the first round most players put up their highest
card of the suit led, no matter what their position with regard to
the leader; but in so doing, they often run needless risks. The
object in Sweepstake Hearts is to take none, and the most successful
players will be found to be those who play consistently with
the greatest odds in their favour for taking none.</p>

<p>Suppose that you hold such a suit as A 10 9 7 4 2. This is a safe
suit; because it is very improbable that you can be compelled to
take a trick in it. The best lead from such a suit is the 10 or 9.
If the suit is led by any other player, the same card should be
played, unless you are fourth hand, and have no objection to the
lead. This avoids the risk, however slight, of getting a heart on
the first round, which would be entailed by playing the ace. In
Sweepstake Hearts it is a great mistake to play the high cards of a
suit in which you are safe; for no matter how small the risk, it is
an unnecessary one. In the case we are considering, when you
have six cards of the suit, the odds are 7 to 1 against your getting
a heart if you play the ace first round. That is to say, you will
probably lose one pool out of every eight if you play it. Take the
greatest odds in your favour, when you have only four cards of a
suit; they are 22 to 1 against your getting a heart the first round,
so that you would lose by it only once in 23 times. But this is a
heavy percentage against you if you are playing with those who
do not run such risks, for you give up every chance you might
otherwise have in 5 pools out of every 110.</p>

<p>When you have a dangerous hand in hearts, but one absolutely
safe long suit, it is often good play to begin with your safe suit,
retaining any high cards you may have in other suits in order to
get the lead as often as possible for the purpose of continuing
your safe suit, which will usually result in one or more of the
other players getting loaded.</p>

<p>When you have at least three of each plain suit it is obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
that you cannot hope for any discards, and that you must take into
account the probability of having to win the third round of one or
more suits, with the accompanying possibility of getting hearts at
the same time. If you have the lead, this probability must be
taken into account before any of the other players show their
hands, and as it may be set down as about 5⅛ to 1 that you will
get a heart, any better chance that the hand affords should be
taken advantage of.</p>

<p>It will often occur that a player’s attention must be so concentrated
on getting clear himself that he has no opportunity to
scheme for “loading” the others. But if it unfortunately happens
that he is compelled to take in one or more hearts, he should at
once turn his attention to taking them all, or to loading the
other players, with a view to making a Jack of the pool. Should
he succeed in either object, he has another chance for his money.</p>

<p>It is usually bad policy to return the suit opened by the original
leader. He has picked that out as his safest suit, and although he
may be the only one safe in it, by continuing it you are reducing
your chances to two players, when you might share them with all
three.</p>

<p><i><b>FOLLOWING SUIT.</b></i> When a player is not the original
leader, his policy becomes defensive; for, as the first player is
plotting to give hearts to every one but himself, each of the others
must be a prospective victim, and should do his best to avoid the
traps prepared by the one who plans the opening of the hand.</p>

<p>When you are second or third player, the first time a suit is led,
it is usually best to play your highest card, unless you are safe in
the suit, or have so many that there is danger of getting a heart,
even on the first round. As fourth player, you should always play
your highest card, unless there is already a heart in the trick, or
some decided disadvantage in the lead. The risks you run in
playing high cards while following suit must be judged by the same
probabilities that we examined in considering the original lead.
The fact that one or more players have already followed suit, and
perhaps the cards they have played, may enable you to arrive at a
still closer estimate of your chances. It is generally conceded,
that the odds against a player who holds up on the first round are
about 1 to 11. That is to say, in 12 pools, he will sacrifice his
chances of one simply by holding up.</p>

<p>After one or two tricks have been played, the conditions may be
such that it becomes necessary to hold up, in order to win the
second round. This is especially the case after you have been
loaded, and are anxious to keep a certain player out of the lead.
For an example see Illustrative Hand No. 4. in which Y holds up
the ♢ King to keep A from getting in and leading another round of
hearts. In the same hand Z tries hard to make the pool a Jack
by holding up the ♣ Q. Had not A been entirely safe in diamonds
the stratagem would have succeeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>In following suit it is important to keep count of the cards
played, in order to avoid the unwitting lead of a suit of which the
other players have none. The suits that need close watching are
those in which you have nothing smaller than a six or eight.
You should be careful to note which player appears to have the
smaller cards, after the suit has been led once or twice, and be on
the watch to take the lead away from him in other suits if you
can, or he may load you by leading the small cards of your dangerous
suit, in which he is safe. When this danger is apparent, it
is best to retain, until the second round, such high cards as Kings
and Queens of the suits led. Even if you have four of the suit,
you run only a 2 to 1 risk in winning the second round instead of
the first, as against a certainty that you will be out of the pool at
once if the dangerous player gets the lead. For an example of
this, see B’s play in Illustrative Hand No. 2.</p>

<p>Where you have a certain safe card, and others of another suit
not absolutely safe, it is better to keep the safe card, in order to
be sure of getting rid of the lead if you are put in on your dangerous
suit.</p>

<p>In following suit, the most annoying hand that one can hold is
one containing at least three cards of each suit, none of them
below a 6. There is no hope of a discard, unless two players
make a fight in some one suit, which they lead four or five times
in order to load each other, regardless of the escape of the other
players. This very seldom occurs, and never among good players.
With such a hand escape is almost impossible, and it is usually
best to make the losses as small as possible. Many good players,
with such a hand, will deliberately take in hearts on the plain suits,
hoping to escape with only one or two in each trick, instead of
having to carry the whole load by getting into the lead at the end.
It should never be forgotten that when you must inevitably take
some hearts it is cheaper to take them in on plain suits than to win
heart tricks.</p>

<p><i><b>CONTROL OF THE LEAD.</b></i> One of the strongest points
in good heart play is the proper control of the lead at certain times.
A player whose hand contains no commanding cards, and who is
unable to do anything but follow suit on the first two or three
rounds, will often find himself compelled to win one of the later
rounds with a small card, taking in one or two hearts with it; and
this misfortune usually overtakes him because a certain player gets
into the lead at a critical period of the hand. If he sees the impending
danger, and has K, Q or J of a suit led, he will not give up
his high card, even if the ace is played to the trick; but will retain
it in order to prevent the possibility of the dangerous player getting
into the lead on the second round of the suit. In doing this, he of
course decreases the odds against his getting hearts, by deliberately
winning the second round. But 2 to 1 in his favour is a much
better chance than the certainty, almost, that he will be loaded if a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
particular player is allowed the opportunity to lead a certain suit
again. See B’s play in Illustrative Hand No 2, and Y’s in No 4.</p>

<p>A player may have no desire to prevent any particular adversary
from getting the lead; but may be anxious simply to carry out a
certain line of play. In order to do this it may be essential that he
should have some direction of the course of the hand. This is
impossible if his play is confined to following suit helplessly, whatever
is led. He must be able to assume the lead himself in order
so to change the course of the play as to better suit his game.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that he has a dangerous hand in plain suits, but
is safe in hearts, and decides that his best chance is to lead hearts
at every opportunity; or that he has a certain safe suit which it is
manifestly to his advantage to have led as often as possible. The
other players, being the ones who are to suffer from this line of
play, will of course prevent it if possible; and in order to carry out
the plan in spite of their opposition, it will be necessary for the individual
player to gain the lead a certain number of times, and so
force his game upon them.</p>

<p>Again, a player may know that he can load a certain adversary
if he can get in and lead a certain suit or card; or he may know
that by giving one player the lead, that player can load another.
In such cases commanding cards must be held or retained, in order
to give the player a certain control of the lead.</p>

<p>When a player is attempting to take all thirteen hearts, the control
of the lead, especially in the end game, is very important;
because the design of each of the other players will be to get the
lead into some other hand, in the hope that they may load the
player having it, and so at least divide the pool.</p>

<p><i><b>THE DISCARD.</b></i> One of the most important elements in
heart play is the discard. The beginner is too apt to discard
hearts at every opportunity; but a little experience will teach him
that even a 3 in a plain suit may be a better card to part with.</p>

<p>The most important thing in discarding is to reduce the odds
against your winning the pool. Let us suppose that you have the
A K Q of a plain suit. It is 5⅛ to 1 that you get a heart if this suit is
led a third time. If you can get a discard, the odds are at once
reduced to 2 to 1 in your favour, that being the probability that you
will escape, even if you have to win two rounds. This is a very
large percentage, and should never be lost sight of. If you have a
choice between two discards, one being from the K Q J 2 of hearts,
and the other from the K Q J of a plain suit, select the plain suit.
You can improve your chances little or none in the hearts, while
you not only bring the odds to your side in the plain suit, but
secure a chance of discarding on the third round of it.</p>

<p>Following the same principle, it is evidently good play to discard
from a suit which has been led once or twice, if you have a
dangerous card or cards in it. Even if you have a safe tenace in
a suit, such as 4 and 2, the 5 and 3 being still out somewhere, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
is better to discard from it if there is the slightest danger of your
getting the lead. Tenaces are only safe when led up to.</p>

<p>In <i><b>Howell’s settling</b></i>, the object is not so much to load the
others as to escape yourself. It is never advisable to attempt to
take all thirteen hearts, because there are no Jacks; but there are
many cases in which it is better deliberately to take three or four,
in order to avoid the chance of taking six or eight. For an example
of these tactics adopted by two players, see Illustrative
Hand, No. 3. On the same principle, there are often cases in
which it is advisable to take a trick with one heart in it, in order
to get rid of a dangerous card, which might bring you in several
hearts later on. The general principles of leading and discarding
are the same as in Sweepstake Hearts; but it is not necessary to
take such desperate chances to escape entirely.</p>

<p><i><b>THREE-HANDED HEARTS</b></i> is more difficult to play
than any other form of the game, partly because there are so many
rounds of each suit, and partly because the moment one player refuses,
the exact cards of that suit in the two other players’ hands
are known to each of them.</p>

<p>There is usually a great deal of cross-fighting in the three-handed
game, during which one player escapes by getting numerous
discards. When all three have refused, each a different suit,
the end game becomes a question of generalship, and the preservation
of one or more commanding cards, with which to control and
place the lead, is usually the key to the situation. A player who
has no high cards for the end game, unless he is quite safe, is
almost certain to be loaded in the last few tricks.</p>

<p><i><b>TWO-HANDED HEARTS.</b></i> Before opening the hand,
the player should carefully consider what suits are safe and what
are dangerous. It is usually best to preserve the safe suits and to
lead the dangerous ones, which you should clear your hand of, if
possible. It is a great advantage to have a missing suit, and
equally disadvantageous to have a number of a suit of which your
adversary is probably clear. If a card of a missing suit is drawn,
it is usually best to lead it at once, so as to keep the suit clear;
but in so doing, be careful first to place the card among the
others in the hand, or your adversary will detect that it is a missing
suit.</p>

<p>The lead is a disadvantage if you have safe hearts; but toward
the end of the stock, from which cards are drawn, it is an advantage
to have commanding cards, with which you can assume the
lead if necessary.</p>

<p>There is some finesse in determining whether or not to change
the suit often in the leads. If you have a better memory than
your adversary, it may be well to change often; but if not, it may
assist you to keep at one suit until afraid to lead it again.</p>

<p>In Two-Handed Hearts, keeping count of the cards is the most
important matter, because the real play comes after the stock is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
exhausted, and the moment that occurs you should know every
card in your adversary’s hand. The exact number of each suit
should be a certainty, if not the exact rank of the cards. Until
you can depend on yourself for this, you are not a good player.
The last thirteen tricks are usually a problem in double-dummy;
but the advantage will always be found to be with the player who
has carefully prepared himself for the final struggle by preserving
certain safe suits, and getting rid of those in which it became evident
that his adversary had the small and safe cards.</p>

<p>Some very pretty positions arise in the end game, it being often
possible to foresee that four or five tricks must be played in a certain
manner in order to ensure the lead being properly placed at
the end, so that the odd hearts may be avoided.</p>

<p><i><b>AUCTION HEARTS.</b></i> The cards having been cut and
dealt, the player to the left of the dealer, whom we shall call A, examines
his hand, and determines which suit he would prefer to
play to get clear of. Let us suppose his hand to consist of the
♡ A K 8; ♣ J 6 5 4 3 2; ♢ K 4; and the ♠ 7 3. If the suit remains
hearts, he is almost certain to take in a number; but if it is changed
to clubs, he is almost as certain of getting clear. The hand is not
absolutely safe, as hearts might be led two or three times before the
clubs in the other hands were exhausted by the original leader,
whose game would be to lead small clubs. As the pool will contain
thirteen counters to a certainty, he can afford to bid in proportion
to his chances of winning it for the privilege of making clubs
the suit to be avoided, instead of hearts.</p>

<p>It might be assumed, if the odds were 10 to 1 that the player
would get clear if the suit were clubs, that therefore he could afford
to bid ten times the amount of the pool, or 130, for his chance.
Theoretically this is correct, but if he should lose one such pool,
he would have to win ten others to get back his bid alone, to say
nothing of the amounts he would lose by paying his share in pools
won by others. Let us suppose him to win his share, one-fourth
of all the pools. While he is winning the ten pools necessary to
repair his single loss, he has to stand his share of the losses in the
thirty others, which would average about 128 counters. This
must show us that even if a player has a 10 to 1 chance in his
favour, he must calculate not only on losing that chance once in
eleven times, but must make provision for the amounts he will lose
in other pools. Experience shows that a bid of 25 would be about
the amount a good player would make on such a hand as we are
considering, if the pool were not a Jack, and he had first say.</p>

<p>The next player, Y, now examines his hand. Let us suppose
that he finds ♡ 6 4 3; ♣ A K 10; ♢ 8 7 5 3; ♠ 6 5 4. If the first
bidder is offering on clubs, it is evident that he will lead them, as
the successful bidder has the original lead in Auction Hearts; and
it is equally evident that if he does so, a player with A K 10 will
have to pay for most of the pool. If any of the other suits is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
one bid on, B has as good a chance for the pool as any one, at
least to divide it. With two men still to bid, a good player would
probably make himself safe by shutting out A’s bid, probably offering
26.</p>

<p>Let us suppose B then to examine his hand, finding ♡ J 10;
♣ Q 9 8 7; ♢ A 10 9; ♠ 10 9 8 2. Being unsafe in everything, he
passes, and practically submits to his fate, his only hope being that
the pool will result in a Jack. Z then examines his hand, finding
♡ Q 9 7 5 2; ♣ none; ♢ Q J 6 2; ♠ A K Q J. He sees at once
that on spades he would lose everything, and on diamonds he
would have a very poor chance. On clubs the result would depend
on how often spades were led. In hearts, he has a very good
hand, especially as he has a missing suit to discard in. As he is
the last bidder he can make sure of the choice for 27, which he
bids, and pays into the pool. The result of the play is given in Illustrative
Hand No. 4. (As the cards happen to lie, had A been the
successful bidder and made it clubs, Z would have won the pool.)</p>

<p><i><b>No. 1. 2nd Trick.</b></i> Z sees that with such a hand escape is
impossible. As his chief danger is in being loaded with hearts
at the end, he clears his hand as rapidly as possible. <i><b>9th Trick.</b></i>
The ♠A being held up, it looks as if A were safe in that suit with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
A 5 2. If Z now leads the ♡ 5, and A gets into the lead, returning
the spade, Z must take every other trick. <i><b>10th Trick.</b></i> If
Z now leads ♠ 7, he loads A; but if his ♡ 5 should win the next
trick he will take all the rest of the hearts, Y and B dividing
the pool. If he leads the ♡ 5 first he cannot get more than
four hearts, and the other players will inevitably make a Jack of
it. <i><b>11th Trick.</b></i> Y sees that if he underplays the 7 led, B will
win the pool, as he has nothing but hearts, A having only one
more. He keeps A out of the lead by winning two rounds, so as
to be sure of loading B, making it a Jack. The ending is very
well played.</p>

<p><i><b>No. 2.</b></i> A has an even chance to escape, and it is better for
him to be third or fourth player in hearts than to lead them.
<i><b>3rd Trick.</b></i> B sees from the fall of the clubs that Y has no
more, and that A is safe in them and will lead them again; so he
holds up ♢ K to keep A out of the lead. <i><b>7th Trick.</b></i> As A’s
hand can now be counted to contain either the 7 4 3 of clubs
and four dangerous hearts, or the 4 3 of clubs and five hearts,
B’s game is clearly to lead diamonds, in order to load Y and Z.
His only dangerous card, the ♡ J, will go on the next round of
spades, which must be led again in the next two or three tricks.</p>

<p><i><b>No. 3.</b></i> A begins with the intermediate cards of his safe suit.
<i><b>8th Trick.</b></i> Y is afraid to lead away from his club tenace, because
it might be at once led back to him. <i><b>9th Trick.</b></i> Z seizes
this opportunity to get rid of the very dangerous ♢5. If A does
not play the ♡A now, it is quite possible that he will take every
trick, except one in diamonds. <i><b>10th Trick.</b></i> If A leads the ♢2,
and hearts are led again, he must take all the remaining hearts.
By taking three at once he can escape the rest. B sees that if he
passes this trick A will at once lead the ♢2, and he will take all
the remaining hearts; so he takes these three and throws the lead
to Y, who has no chance to injure him. <i>11th Trick.</i> Z keeps
two clubs, hoping that if Y gets in and leads clubs, B may discard
a diamond instead of a heart, in which case Z would get clear.</p>

<p><i><b>No. 4.</b></i> A, with his dangerous suit of spades, clears up the
hearts at once. <i><b>6th Trick.</b></i> The second round of spades
betrays A’s dangerous suit to the other players. <i><b>7th Trick.</b></i> A
must risk the King and 3 being divided, for if they are in one
hand nothing will save him. Z keeps ♢9 and ♣Q in order to be
sure of getting a lead, as he is the only player who can load A by
putting him in on spades at the end making him take in his own
hearts. <i><b>8th Trick.</b></i> B cannot risk playing the high clubs while
there is any chance for him to win the pool. He can count A to
be safe in diamonds, with two hearts and two spades. <i><b>10th
Trick.</b></i> A clears his hand of the very dangerous spade before
leading his tenace in diamonds. <i><b>12th Trick.</b></i> A will not give
up the heart until he is sure that B has not the ♣7.</p>

<h3>SLOBBERHANNES.</h3>

<p><i><b>Cards.</b></i> Slobberhannes is played with a Euchre pack, thirty-two
cards, all below the Seven being deleted. The cards rank:
A K Q J 10 9 8 7, the ace being the highest both in cutting and in
play. There is no trump suit.</p>

<p><i><b>Counters.</b></i> Each player is provided with ten counters, and
points are marked by placing these counters in the pool. The
player who first loses his ten counters also loses the game. If
stakes are played for, counters of a different colour must be provided,
and the player losing the game must pay as many counters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
to each of the others as they have points still in front of them.
One player is usually the banker, and sells and redeems all money
counters. The others are redistributed at the end of each game.</p>

<p><i><b>Players.</b></i> Any number from four to seven may play; but the
two black Sevens must be deleted if there are more than four
players. When seven play, the dealer takes no cards. All the
preliminaries of seats, cards and deal are settled as at Hearts.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> The entire pack is distributed, the dealer giving
each player in rotation two or three cards in each round. No
trump is turned. All irregularities in the deal are governed by the
same laws as at Hearts; but a misdeal does not lose the deal
under any circumstances. The same dealer must deal again.</p>

<p><i><b>Objects of the Game.</b></i> The object in Slobberhannes is to
avoid taking either the first or the last trick, or any trick containing
the Queen of clubs. The player who wins any of these loses one
point, and if he wins all three of them, he loses an extra point, or
four altogether. The penalty for a revoke is also the loss of a
point.</p>

<p><i><b>Method of Playing.</b></i> The eldest hand begins by leading
any card he pleases, and the others must follow suit if they can.
The highest card played, if of the suit led, wins the trick, and the
winner takes it in and leads for the next trick. The player winning
the first trick must pay for it immediately, to avoid disputes.
The tricks which are neither the first nor the last have no value,
unless they contain the club Queen, which must be paid for as
soon as it is taken in.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of play in manœuvring to get rid of cards
which might win the last trick, or which would take in the club
Queen. The Ace and King of clubs are of course dangerous
cards, and unless the player holding them has small cards enough
to make him safe in that suit, he should be on the alert for opportunities
to discard.</p>

<h3>POLIGNAC. QUATRE-VALETS, OR FOUR JACKS.</h3>

<p><i><b>Cards and Players.</b></i> When Polignac is played by four
persons, a Piquet pack is used, and eight cards are dealt to each
player, 3-2-3 at a time. When five play, the two black Sevens are
deleted, and six cards are given to each player. When six play,
each receives five cards. When seven play, the dealer takes no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
cards. In France, the cards usually rank as in Écarté; K Q J A
10 9 8 7; but in England and America it is more usual to preserve
the order in Piquet, A K Q J 10 9 8 7. There is no trump suit.
All the preliminaries are settled as at Hearts or Slobberhannes.</p>

<p><i><b>Counters.</b></i> Each player is provided with ten or twenty counters,
as may be agreed upon, and the player first losing his counters
loses the game, and pays to each of the others any stake that may
have been previously agreed upon, usually a counter for each point
they have still to go when he is decavé.</p>

<p><i><b>Objects of the Game.</b></i> The object of the game is to avoid
winning any trick containing a Jack, and especially the Jack of
spades, which is called <i><b>Polignac</b></i>. The moment any player wins
a trick containing a Jack, he pays one counter into the pool. If he
takes in Polignac, he pays two counters. The eldest hand begins
by leading any card he pleases, and the others must follow suit if
they can. The highest card played, if of the suit led, wins the
trick, and the winner leads for the next trick. If a player has none
of the suit led he may discard anything he pleases.</p>

<p>The game is sometimes varied by adding a <i><b>general</b></i>, or <i><b>capot</b></i>.
Any player who thinks he can win all the tricks announces capot
before the first card is led. If he is successful he loses nothing;
but each of the others must pay five counters into the pool, one
for each Jack, and one extra for Polignac. If the capot player
fails to win every trick, each player pays for whatever jacks he has
taken in.</p>

<h3>ENFLÉ, OR SCHWELLEN.</h3>

<p>When Enflé is played by four persons, the Piquet pack of thirty-two
cards is used. If there are more than four players, sufficient
cards are added to give eight to each person. The rank of the
cards and all other preliminaries are the same as at Hearts. There
is no trump suit.</p>

<p>The cards are dealt 3-2-3 at a time. The eldest hand leads
any card he pleases, and the others must follow suit if they can.
If all follow suit, the highest card played wins the trick, which is
turned face down, and the cards in it are dead. The winner leads
for the next trick, and so on. But if any player is unable to follow
suit, he is not allowed to discard, but must immediately gather up
the cards already played, and take them into his own hand with
the cards originally dealt to him. The players following the one
who renounces to the suit led do not play to the trick at all; but
wait for him to lead for the next trick. Should any player fail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
follow suit on the next trick, or on any subsequent trick, he gathers
the cards already played, takes them into his hand and leads for
the next trick. The play is continued in this manner until some
player gets rid of all his cards, and so wins the game.</p>

<p>Enflé is usually played for a pool, to which each player contributes
an equal amount before play begins. The game requires
considerable skill and memory to play it well, it being very important
to remember the cards taken in hand by certain players, and
those which are in the tricks turned down.</p>

<h3>THE LAWS OF HEARTS.</h3>

<p>1. Formation of table. Those first in the room have the preference.
If more than the necessary number assemble, the choice
shall be determined by cutting, those cutting the lowest cards having
the right to play. Six persons is the largest number that can
play at one table. The player cutting the lowest card has the
deal.</p>

<p>2. In cutting, the Ace is low. Players cutting cards of equal
value, cut again. All must cut from the same pack, and any person
exposing more than one card must cut again. Drawing cards
from an outspread pack is equivalent to cutting.</p>

<p>3. A complete Heart pack consists of fifty-two cards, which
rank in the following order:&mdash;A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2, the Ace
being highest in play. In Three-Handed Hearts, the spade deuce
is thrown out. In Five-Handed, both the black deuces are laid
aside. In Six-Handed, all four deuces are discarded. In Joker
Hearts the heart deuce is replaced by the Joker.</p>

<p>4. When two packs are used, the player next but one on the
dealer’s left must collect and shuffle the cards for the next deal,
placing them on his right. The dealer has the privilege of shuffling
last.</p>

<p>5. The dealer must present the pack to his right-hand adversary
to be cut. Not less than four cards shall constitute a cut.</p>

<p>6. In case of any confusion or exposure of the cards in cutting,
or in reuniting them after cutting, the pack must be shuffled and
cut again.</p>

<p>7. If the dealer reshuffles the cards after they have been properly
cut, or looks at the bottom card, he loses his deal.</p>

<p>8. After the cards have been cut, the dealer must distribute
them one at a time to each player in rotation, beginning at his left,
and continuing until the pack is exhausted; or in Two-Handed
Hearts, until each player has thirteen.</p>

<p>9. The deal passes to the left.</p>

<p>10. There must be a new deal by the same dealer if the pack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
is proved to be incorrect, either during the deal or during the play
of a hand; or if any card is faced in the pack, or is found to be so
marked or mutilated that it can be named. In the last case a new
pack must be used.</p>

<p>11. If a card is exposed during the deal, the player to whom it is
dealt may demand a new deal, provided he has not touched any
of his cards. If the deal stands, the exposed card cannot be
called.</p>

<p>12. Any one dealing out of turn may be stopped before the last
card is dealt. After that the deal must stand, and the packs, if
changed, must so remain.</p>

<p>13. It is a misdeal: If the dealer omits to have the pack cut, and
the error is discovered before the last card is dealt; or if he deals
a card incorrectly, and fails to remedy it before dealing another;
or if he counts the cards on the table, or those remaining in the
pack; or if it is discovered before all have played to the first trick
that any player has not his proper number of cards, the pack being
perfect.</p>

<p>14. A misdeal loses the deal unless one of the other players has
touched his cards, or in any way interrupted the dealer.</p>

<p>15. If, after the first trick is played to, any two players are
found to have more or less than their correct number of cards, the
pack being perfect, the one having less shall draw from the hand
of the one having more, and each shall pay a forfeit of five counters
into the pool.</p>

<p>16. If a player omits to play to any trick, and plays to the following
one, he shall not be allowed to correct the error; but shall
be compelled to take in the last trick, with whatever hearts it may
contain.</p>

<p>17. Should a player be found during or at the end of a hand to
be a card short, all the others having the right number, and all
having played to the first trick, he shall be compelled to take in
the last trick.</p>

<p>18. If a player leads or plays two cards to a trick, he must indicate
the one intended, and leave the other face up on the table.
Any card exposed, except in the proper course of play, or any card
named by the player holding it, must be left face up on the table.</p>

<p>19. A player must lead or play any exposed card when called
upon to do so by any other player, provided he can do so without
revoking. He cannot be prevented from playing an exposed card,
and if he can so get rid of it, no penalty remains.</p>

<p>20. If a player leads out of turn, a suit may be called from him
when it is next his proper turn to lead. This penalty can be enforced
only by the player on his right. If he has none of the suit
called, or if all have played to the false lead, no penalty can be
enforced. If all have not played to the false lead, the cards can
be taken back, and are not exposed cards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>21. If the third hand plays before the second, the fourth hand
may demand that the card be taken back, and may call upon the
third hand to play the highest card he has of the suit; or may call
upon him not to discard hearts. If the fourth plays before the
third, the second player may demand the penalty.</p>

<p>22. The first player to any trick having led, the others must follow
suit if they can. Should a player revoke, and discover the
error before the trick in which it occurs has been turned and
quitted, he may amend his play, and the card played in error becomes
an exposed card. Any who have played after him may
withdraw their cards and substitute others, the cards first played
not being exposed.</p>

<p>23. If the revoke is discovered during the play of the hand, the
hand must be played out, and at the end the revoking player must
pay all losses in that hand. Should the revoking player win the
pool himself, he must pay to the pool thirteen counters and leave
them for a Jack. Should he divide it, he must pay the other winner
six counters, and leave up seven for a Jack.</p>

<p>24. Should two or more players revoke in the same hand, each
must pay the entire losses in the hand, as if he were alone in
error; so that if two should revoke, and a third win the pool, he
would receive twenty-six counters, instead of thirteen. In Auction
Hearts the revoking player must pay the amount of the bid in
addition.</p>

<p>25. The claimant of a revoke may search all the tricks at the
end of a hand. The revoke is established if the accused player
mixes the cards before the claimants have time to examine them.</p>

<p>26. A revoke must be claimed before the tricks have been
mixed, preparatory to shuffling for the next deal.</p>

<p>27. If a player is lawfully called upon to lead a certain suit, or to
play the highest of it, and unnecessarily fails to comply, he is liable
to the penalties for a revoke.</p>

<p>28. Any trick once turned and quitted must not again be seen
until the hand is played. Any player violating this rule is subject
to the same penalties as for a lead out of turn.</p>

<p>29. In settling at the end of the hand, the player having taken
no hearts, [each of the others having taken at least one,] wins
the pool. Two players having taken none, the other two having
each at least one, divide it, the odd counter remaining until the
next pool. Three players having taken none, the thirteen counters
remain in the pool, forming a Jack, which can be won only by one
player taking no hearts, each of the others having taken at least
one. During the time the Jack is played for, and until it is won,
each player must add to the pool by paying for the hearts he
takes in each hand.</p>

<p>30. In Auction Hearts, the player to the left of the dealer has
the first bid, the dealer the last, and there is no second bid.</p>

<h2 id="THE_BEZIQUE_FAMILY">THE BÉZIQUE FAMILY.</h2>

<p>This family includes three of our most popular games; Bézique
itself, Binocle, and Sixty-Six. These are all comparatively modern
games, but are descended from very old stock, the best known of
the ancestors being Marriage, Matrimony, and Cinq-Cents. The
etymology of the word Bézique is very much disputed. Some
claim that it is from the Spanish basa, afterwards basico, a little
kiss; referring to the union of the spade Queen and the diamond
Jack, and the various marriages in the game. This was afterwards
Basique, transformed by the French to Bésique, and by the English
to Bézique. One English writer thinks the word is from
bésaigne, the double-headed axe.</p>

<p>Judging from the rank of the cards, which is peculiar to German
games, Bézique may have originated in an attempt to play Binocle
with a piquet pack, for Binocle seems to have been originally
played with a full pack of fifty-two cards. One German writer
says the game is of Swiss origin, and that they probably got it from
Spain. In one writer’s opinion, the name Binocle, is derived from
<i>bis</i>, until, and <i>knochle</i>, the knuckle, which would imply that the
original meaning was, until some one knuckled; <i>i.e.</i>, stopped the
game by knocking on the table with his knuckles. This interpretation
seems far-fetched, but if correct, it would sustain the opinion
that Binocle was derived from the old game of Cinq-Cents, in which
the player knocked with his knuckles to announce that he had made
enough points to win the game. In the opinion of the author, the
word “binocle” is a German mispronunciation of the French
word “binage,” which was the term used in Cinq Cents for the
combination of spade Queen and diamond Jack, as will be seen if
the description of Cinq Cents is referred to. Stopping the play is
a prominent feature in Sixty-Six, another variation of Bézique, and
the connecting link between Binocle and Skat. In Sixty-Six, the
combination known as Bézique, or binocle, is omitted; so is the
sequence in trumps. Sixty-four-card Binocle is simply Bézique,
with a slight difference in the counting value of the various combinations.
Sometimes twelve cards are given to each player.</p>

<p>Great confusion seems to have existed when the game of Bézique
was introduced to England, in the winter of 1868-9, owing to the
fact that so many persons rushed into print with their own private
opinions of the rules, which were first given by Dr. Pole, in 1861<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>.
No one knew whether “the last trick” was the absolute last, or
the last before the stock was exhausted. Whether the highest or
lowest cut dealt was also a matter of dispute. “Cavendish” got
both these wrong in the first edition of his “Pocket Guide,” but
corrected himself without explanation or apology in the second
edition. It was then the custom of many players to attach no
value to the trump suit until the stock was exhausted; so that
until the last eight tricks there was no such thing as trumping a
trick in order to win it. Disputes also arose as to counting double
combinations, many contending that a double marriage should be
as valuable as a double bézique. Time and experience have
finally settled all these points, and the rules of the game are now
practically uniform in all countries.</p>

<h3>BÉZIQUE, OR SIXTY-FOUR-CARD BINOCLE.</h3>

<p>There are two forms of Bézique in common use; the ordinary
game, which will be first described, and the variation known as
Rubicon Bézique, which is to Bézique proper what Railroad
Euchre is to Euchre.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Bézique is played with two packs of thirty-two
cards each, all below the Seven being deleted, and the two packs
being then shuffled together and used as one. It is better to have
both packs of the same colour and pattern, but it is not absolutely
necessary. The cards rank, A 10 K Q J 9 8 7; the Ace being the
highest, both in cutting and in play.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p375.jpg" width="300" height="100" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Pull-Up Bézique Marker.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i><b>COUNTERS.</b></i> Special markers are made for scoring at
Bézique; but the score may easily be kept by means of counters.
Each player should be provided with four white, four blue, and
one red, together with some special marker, such as a copper cent
or a button. The button stands for 500 points, each blue counter
for 100, the red for 50, and the white ones for 10 each. At the
beginning of the game the counters are placed on the left of the
player, and are passed from left to right as the points accrue, exchanging
smaller denominations for higher when necessary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
Many persons find it more convenient to peg the game on a
pull-up cribbage board, starting at 21, counting each peg as 10
points, and going twice round to the game hole.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> Bézique is played for so much a game, 1,000
points up; or for so much a point, the score of the loser being
deducted from that of the winner. When a partie of five games
is agreed upon, it is usual to have an extra stake upon the odd
game, and when three games have been won by the same player,
the partie is at an end. It is usual to count it a double game if
the loser has not reached 500 points.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Bézique is played by two persons, one of
whom is known as the <i><b>dealer</b></i>, and the other as the <i><b>pone</b></i>.
They cut for choice of seats and deal, the player cutting the
highest card having the first choice, and electing whether or not
to deal himself. In cutting, the cards rank as in play, and the ace
is the highest. If a player exposes more than one card, he must
cut again.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> The cards are thoroughly shuffled, and presented
to the pone to be cut. At least five cards must be left in
each packet. The cards are then dealt three at a time for the first
round, two for the next, and three for the last, each player receiving
eight cards. The seventeenth is then turned up for the trump.
If this card is a Seven, the dealer scores 10 points for it at once.
The trump card is laid on the table by itself, the remainder of the
pack, which is called the <i><b>stock</b></i> or <i><b>talon</b></i>, is slightly spread, to
facilitate the process of drawing cards from it, and to be sure that
none of the cards remaining in the undealt portion are exposed.
In sixty-four-card Binocle twelve cards are sometimes dealt to
each player.</p>

<p><i><b>Misdealing.</b></i> A misdeal does not lose the deal, but in some
cases a new deal is at the option of the adversary. If the dealer
exposes a card belonging to the adversary or to the stock, the pone
may demand a new deal; but if either player exposes any of his
own cards, the deal stands good. If too many cards are given to
either player, there must be a new deal. If too few, the pone may
claim a fresh deal, or allow the dealer to supply the missing cards
from the top of the stock, without changing the trump card. If
any card but the trump is found faced in the pack, there must be a
new deal. If a card faced in the stock is not discovered until the
first trick has been played to, the exposed card must be turned
face down, without disturbing its position. If a pack is found to
be imperfect, the deal in which the error is discovered is void, but
all previous cuts or scores made with that pack stand good.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The pone begins by leading
any card he chooses, to which his adversary may play any card he
pleases. A player is not obliged to follow suit, nor to trump; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
may renounce or trump at pleasure until the stock is exhausted,
after which the method of play undergoes a change. If a player
follows suit, the higher card wins the trick, and if identical cards
are played to the same trick, such as two Jacks of clubs, the leader
wins. Trumps win plain suits. The winner of the trick takes in
the cards, turning them face down; but before he leads for the
next trick he has the privilege of announcing and scoring any one
of certain combinations that he may hold in his hand. After, or
in the absence of any such announcement, and before leading for
the next trick, he draws a card from the top of the stock and places
it in his hand, without showing or naming it. His adversary draws
the next card, so that each player restores the number of cards in
his hand to eight. This method of drawing from the stock is
open to many objections, and in France the pone always draws
first, no matter who wins the trick.</p>

<p>All combinations announced and scored must be laid face upward
on the table; but the cards still form part of the player’s
hand, and may be led or played at any time, although they must
not again be taken in hand until the stock is exhausted.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> The reasons for winning
or not winning certain tricks will be better understood in connection
with the description of the various combinations that count
toward game, and the manner of scoring them.</p>

<p><i><b>Brisques.</b></i> The aces and Tens of each suit are called brisques,
and count ten points each towards game. Except for the purpose
of getting or keeping the lead, there is no object in winning any
trick which does not contain a brisque. Every brisque taken in
should be scored at once by the player winning the trick; 10 points
for an ace or Ten; 20 points if there are two such cards in the
same trick.</p>

<p>A player holding or drawing the <i><b>Seven of trumps</b></i> has the privilege
of exchanging it for the turn-up trump, and scoring 10 points
at the same time; but he must make the exchange immediately
after winning a trick, and before drawing his card from the stock.
Should the turn-up card be a Seven, or one exchange have already
been made, the exchange can still be made and scored. He cannot
score the Seven and make a declaration at the same time.</p>

<p><i><b>DECLARATIONS.</b></i> The combinations which may be announced
and scored during the play of the hand are divided into
three classes: Marriages and Sequences; Béziques; and Fours of
a kind. Only one combination can be scored at a time, and it
must be announced immediately after the player holding it has
won a trick, and before he draws his card from the talon. If he
draws without announcing, it is equivalent to saying he has no
declaration to make. Having drawn his card, even if he has not
looked at it, he cannot score any declaration until he wins another
trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>The combinations and their values are as follows:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>The four court cards in class C may be all of different suits, or
any two of them may be of the same suit.</p>

<p>A great many misunderstandings arise with respect to the manner
and order of making declarations, most of which may be
avoided by remembering the following rules:</p>

<p>The player making the declaration must have won the previous
trick, and must make his announcement before drawing his card
from the stock. When the stock is exhausted, so that there is no
card to be drawn, no announcement can be made.</p>

<p>Only one declaration can be scored at a time, so that a trick
must be won for every announcement made, or the combination
cannot be scored. This does not prevent a player from making
two or more announcements at the same time, but he can score
only one of them.</p>

<p>A player cannot make a lower declaration with cards which form
part of a higher one already made in the same class. For instance:
Marriages and sequences belong to the same class. If
the sequence has been declared, a player cannot take from it the
King and Queen and score a marriage; neither can he add a new
Queen to the King already in the sequence, and announce a marriage;
because the higher combination was scored first. But if
the marriage is first announced, the A 10 J may be added and the
sequence scored, after winning another trick.</p>

<p>Cards once used in combination cannot again be used in combinations
of equal value of the same class. For instance: Four
Kings have been declared, and one of them afterward used in the
course of play. The player cannot add a new King to the three
remaining, and announce four Kings again. A marriage in spades
has been declared, and the King got rid of in play. A new King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
of spades will not make another marriage with the old Queen. A
bézique has been scored, and the Jack got rid of in play; a new
Jack of diamonds will not make another bézique with the old
Queen.</p>

<p>Some judgment is necessary in making announcements, the
question of time being often important. Suppose hearts are
trumps, and the winner of the trick holds double bézique, sixty
Queens, and a royal marriage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p379.jpg" width="400" height="75" alt="🃋 🃋 🂭 🂭 🃍 🂽 🂾" />
</div>

<p>He cannot lay all these cards down at once, and claim 600
points. Neither can he lay down four Queens and two Jacks,
and score 560; nor four Queens and a King and score 100. He
may announce them if he chooses to expose his hand in that manner,
but he can score only one combination, and must win a separate
trick to score each of the others. It would be better for him
to select some one of the combinations, and declare it, waiting until
he won another trick to declare the next one. A beginner
would be apt to declare the highest count first, 500 for the double
bézique; but under the rule which prevents a player from making
a declaration which forms part of a higher one of the same class
already made, he would lose the 40 points for the single bézique.
It would be better to declare the single bézique first, scoring 40
points for it, and after winning another trick to show the other
bézique, scoring 500 points more for the double combination. A
player is not allowed to score 40 for the second bézique, and then
500 for the two combined; because if new announcements are
made in the same class, at least one new card must be added
from the player’s hand when the announcement is made, even if it
is not scored until later.</p>

<p><i><b>Double Declarations.</b></i> It frequently happens that a player
is forced to make two declarations at the same time, although he
can score only one of them. For instance: A player has announced
and shown four Kings, one of them being the King of
spades. On winning another trick he shows and scores bézique.
One of the bézique cards forms a marriage with the spade King,
and as the combinations belong to different classes, both may be
scored, although the same card is used in each; but the player
cannot score the second combination until he wins another trick.
Under such circumstances it is usual to declare both combinations,
scoring the more valuable, and repeating the one left over until
an opportunity arises to score it. In this case the player would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
say: “Forty for bézique, and twenty to score.” If he lost the
next trick he would continue to repeat at every trick: “Twenty to
score,” until he won a trick.</p>

<p>A player having a score in abeyance in this manner is not
obliged to score it if he has anything else to announce. A player
with twenty to score might pick up the sequence in trumps before
he won another trick, and he would be very foolish to lose the chance
to score 250 for the sake of the 20 already announced. If he had
time, he would probably declare: “Royal Marriage, forty, and
twenty to score.” On winning another trick he would add the A
10 J of trumps, and announce, “Two-fifty in trumps, and twenty
to score,” still carrying on the small score for a future opportunity.</p>

<p>A player may lay down and score eighty Kings, and afterward
sixty Queens, the remaining Kings forming marriages. In such a
case he would score the sixty points first, and declare the two or
three marriages remaining. In the same manner he may have
announced four Kings, and after playing away two of them, leaving
two Kings of spades, he may declare double bézique, and
claim the two marriages “to score.” In all such cases it must
be remembered that the cards declared must still be on the table
when the time comes to score them. If, in the case just given, one
of the cards forming either of the marriages was got rid of in the
course of play, that marriage could not afterward be scored,
although it had been properly announced. If the stock is exhausted
before the player with a score in abeyance can win another
trick, the score is lost.</p>

<p>It is often very important for a player to know how much time
he has to score. When the talon is spread it is comparatively easy
to judge how many more tricks remain to be played. The English
laws allow a player to count the stock, the French do not. A
trick once turned and quitted cannot again be seen, and the
players are not allowed to count the number of tricks they have
won.</p>

<p>The last card of the stock is taken by the player winning the
trick, and the turn-up trump goes to his adversary.</p>

<p><i><b>The Last Eight Tricks.</b></i> When the stock is exhausted, the
players take back into their hands all the cards remaining of the
combinations which have been laid on the table. The winner of
the previous trick then leads any card he pleases, but his adversary
must now not only follow suit, but must win the trick if he can,
either with a superior card of the same suit, or with a trump.
The same rule applies to all the remaining tricks. Brisques still
count for the winner of the trick containing them, and should be
scored as soon as made. The winner of the last trick of all scores
ten points for it immediately, in addition to any brisques that it
may contain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in Play.</b></i> If a player leads out of turn, and
his adversary plays to the lead, whether intentionally or otherwise,
the trick stands good. If the adversary calls attention to the
error, the card led out of turn may be taken back without penalty.</p>

<p>If a player has too many cards after playing to the first trick,
his adversary may either claim a fresh deal or may compel him to
play without drawing from the talon, until the number of cards in
his hand is reduced to eight; the player with too many cards not
being allowed to make any announcements until he has his right
number of cards. If a player has too few cards, his adversary may
either claim a fresh deal, or may allow him to make good the deficiency
by drawing from the stock.</p>

<p>After the stock is exhausted, any player failing to follow suit or
to win a trick, when able to do so, may be compelled to take back
his cards to the point where the error occurred, and to replay the
hand. In France he is penalised by counting nothing from that
point on, either for brisques or for the last trick.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in Drawing.</b></i> If a player has forgotten to
take a card from the talon, and has played to the next trick, his
adversary may elect to call the deal void, or to allow him to draw
two cards next time.</p>

<p>If a player has drawn two cards from the stock, instead of one,
he must show the second one to his adversary if he has seen it
himself. If he has not seen it, he may put it back without penalty.
If he draws out of turn, he must restore the card improperly
drawn; and if it belongs to his adversary the player in error must
show his own card. If both players draw the wrong cards there
is no remedy.</p>

<p>If the loser of any trick draws and looks at two cards from the
stock, his adversary may look at both cards of the following draw,
and may select either for himself. If he chooses the second card,
he need not show it.</p>

<p>If, on account of some undetected irregularity, an even number
of cards remain in the stock, the last card must not be drawn.
The winner of the trick takes the last but one, and the loser takes
the trump card.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregular Announcements.</b></i> Should a player announce
four of a kind, having only three; as, for instance, laying down
three Kings and a Jack, and declaring four Kings, his adversary
can compel him not only to take down the score erroneously
marked, but to lead or play one of the three Kings. A player
may be called upon to lead or play cards from any other erroneous
declarations in the same manner; but if the player has the right
card or cards in his hand, he is permitted to amend his error, provided
he has not drawn a card from the stock in the meantime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> It is better to score all points as soon as they
are made. The game is usually 1000 points. Some players do
not count the brisques until the last trick has been played, but the
practice is not to be recommended. Scores erroneously marked
must be taken down, and the adversary may add the points to his
own score.</p>

<h3>FOUR-HANDED BÉZIQUE.</h3>

<p>In this variation, four persons may play; each for himself or
two against two, partners sitting opposite each other. Four packs
of thirty-two cards each are shuffled together and used as one.
Triple bézique counts 1500. When a player wins a trick, either he
or his partner may declare everything in the hand, but only one
combination can be scored at a time. The advantage of showing
all the combinations in the hand is that they may be built up by
either partner. For instance: One partner has declared bézique
and royal marriage, scoring the marriage only. His partner wins
the next trick and adds A 10 J to the marriage, scoring the sequence;
or perhaps shows three Kings or Queens, making fours.</p>

<p>The players usually divide after the stock is exhausted, and for
the last eight tricks each takes one of his former adversaries for a
partner, but without changing seats. The game is usually 2000
points up.</p>

<h3>THREE-HANDED BÉZIQUE.</h3>

<p>Three persons play, each for himself. Two packs of thirty-two
cards each and one of thirty-one cards are shuffled together.
Triple bézique counts 1500, and the game is usually 2000 points.</p>

<p>The deleted card from the third pack should be an Eight.</p>

<h3>POLISH BÉZIQUE.</h3>

<p>This differs from the ordinary game only in the value of the
tricks taken. The winner of each trick, instead of turning it down
after counting the brisques, takes from it any court cards it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
contain, and the Ten of trumps. He lays these cards face up on
the table, but apart from those declared from his own hand, and
uses them to form combinations, which may be scored in the usual
way. The chief difference is that cards so taken in tricks cannot
be led or played to subsequent tricks, nor can they be taken in
hand at the end of the stock. Combinations may be completed
either by cards in the player’s hand, or by cards won in subsequent
tricks.</p>

<h3>CINQ-CENTS.</h3>

<p>This might be described as Bézique with one pack of cards. All
the regulations are the same as in the modern form of Bézique, but
there is an additional count, 120, for a sequence of the five highest
cards in any plain suit. Bézique is called <i><b>Binage</b></i>, and of course
there are no double combinations. Cards which have been used in
one combination cannot be used in any other, even of a different
class.</p>

<p>Brisques are not scored as they are won; but after the hand is
over, and ten points have been counted for the last trick, each
player turns over his cards and counts up the value of the points
they contain. In this final count, the Ace reckons for 11, the Ten
for 10, King for 4, Queen for 3, Jack for 2, no matter what the
suit may be, so that there are 120 points to be divided between the
players. It is usual for only one to count, the other taking the
difference between his total and 120.</p>

<p>From this it might be imagined that no notice was taken of the
counting value of the cards taken in during the progress of the play.
Early in the game this is true, but toward the end each player
must keep very careful mental count of the value of his tricks, although
he is not allowed to score them. When either player
knows, by adding the mental count of his tricks to his scored declarations,
that he has made points enough to win the game, he
stops the play by knocking on the table, either with his knuckles
or his cards. He then turns over his tricks and counts the points
they contain to show his adversary that he has won the game.
Even if his adversary has also enough points to go out, the player
who knocked wins the game, provided his count is correct. If the
player who knocks is mistaken, and cannot count out, he loses, no
matter what his adversary may have.</p>

<p>If neither knocks, and at the end of the hand both players are
found to have points enough to put them out, neither wins the
game, which must be continued for 100 points more; that is, as 500<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
points is the usual game, it must be made 600 in such a case.
Should both reach 600 without knocking, it must be continued to
700. If neither knocks, and only one has enough points to go out
he wins the game on its merits.</p>

<p>As the name implies, 500 points is game.</p>

<h3>PENCHANT.</h3>

<p>Penchant is a complicated form of Cinq-cents and Bézique,
played with a single pack of thirty-two cards, which rank as at Piquet;
A K Q J 10 9 8 7, the ace being highest both in cutting and
in play.</p>

<p><i><b>Cutting.</b></i> The higher cut has the choice of seats, and the lower
cut deals the first hand.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> After the cards have been cut by the pone the
dealer gives one card to his adversary, then one to the stock, and
then one to himself, all face down. Two more are then given to
the stock, one to the pone, two to the stock again, and one to the
dealer. This is continued, giving two cards to the stock between
the ones given to each player, until the last round, when only one
card is dealt to the stock. This will result in each player receiving
six cards, and twenty being left in the centre of the table for the
talon. No trump is turned. Very few players trouble themselves
with this method of dealing, preferring to deal three cards to each
player alternately, leaving the remaining twenty for the stock.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing.</b></i> All the regulations for leading, following suit, drawing
from the talon, etc., are the same as in Bézique, but the declarations
and their values are quite different.</p>

<p><i><b>Brisques.</b></i> There are twelve brisque cards, the Seven of each
suit being added to the usual Aces and Tens. The brisques are
not scored as taken in, except in the last six tricks. At the end of
the hand all the brisques are counted, whether already scored in
the last six tricks or not, and the player having more than six counts
ten points for each above six. If each has six, neither scores. By
this method, a player may make and score several brisques in the
last six tricks, all of which he will reckon over again in the total
count at the end.</p>

<p><i><b>Declarations.</b></i> The winner of any trick, previous to the exhaustion
of the stock, may announce and lay upon the table any
one of ten different combinations, which are divided into three
classes. These are as follows, with the number of points he is entitled
to score for each:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<table summary="Combinations and their values">

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Any Queen and Jack of different suits,</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The sequences and flushes in class B must all be of the same
suit; penchant cards must be of different suits.</p>

<p>If the winner of any trick has no declaration to make, he signifies
it by drawing the top card from the stock. His adversary, before
drawing his card from the stock, may then declare a penchant,
if he has one; but no other combination can be declared by the
player who does not win the trick. If the winner of the trick
makes any declaration, the loser cannot declare.</p>

<p>The Jack of the first penchant declared makes the <i><b>trump suit</b></i>
for that deal, no matter which player announces it. Trumps do
not increase the value of any combination, and are only useful to
win plain-suit tricks.</p>

<p>All declarations are scored immediately, either on a marker or
with counters. It will be observed that with the exception of
sequences of five cards, fours, and penchants, the count is ten
points for each card in the combination. Only one declaration can
be made at a time.</p>

<p>Any card laid upon the table for one declaration can be used
again in future declarations, provided the player making the new
announcement adds at least one fresh card from his hand. A
player having a marriage and a penchant on the table cannot afterward
score for the pair of Queens; but if he adds a Queen from his
hand he can score the triplet.</p>

<p>Pairs, triplets and fours are divided into two classes, the major
being formed of court cards; the minor of cards below the Jack.
Minor combinations cannot be scored if the adversary has upon the
table cards which form a major combination of the same or greater
value in the same class; that is, in class A. For instance: If your
adversary has two Queens on the table, you cannot announce any
pair below Jacks. His Queens need not have been announced as
a pair; they may be parts of a marriage and a penchant. But if
you have on the table a pair as good as his, you can score minor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
pairs. For instance: He has two Kings on the table, and you have
two Aces. Your Aces cancel his Kings, and you can score any
minor pair; but he can not. If you have a minor triplet to declare,
such as three Eights, no major pair of his will bar it, because your
triplet counts more than his pair. No minor combination on his
side will bar you; it must be one of court cards, and it must be
better than any that you have laid on the table yourself.</p>

<p><i><b>The Last Six Tricks.</b></i> After the stock is exhausted, the
second player must follow suit if able, and must win the trick if he
can. As already explained, brisques won in the last six tricks are
scored as they are taken in, and after the last card is played all the
brisques are re-counted, the player holding more than six scoring ten
points for each above that number. There is no score for winning
the last trick.</p>

<p>Four deals is a game. At the end of the fourth deal the lower
score is deducted from the higher, and the difference is the value
of the game in points. If the lesser score is not at least 400 points,
the winner doubles the difference in his favour.</p>

<p>The only text-book on this game introduces a great many technical
terms which have no meaning to the ordinary card-player,
and which have therefore been omitted from this description.</p>

<p><i><b>Suggestions for Good Play</b></i> will be found in Binocle.</p>

<h3>RUBICON BÉZIQUE.</h3>

<p>Rubicon Bézique bears the same relation to the ordinary game
that Railroad Euchre does to Euchre proper. In fact the game
might well be called Railroad Bézique, for its chief peculiarity is the
rapid accumulation of large scores. The game seems to have
originated in France, but is now very popular wherever Bézique is
played.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Rubicon Bézique is played with four piquet packs
of thirty-two cards each; all below the Sevens being deleted from
an ordinary pack. The four packs, which should be of the same
pattern and colour, are shuffled together and used as one. The
cards rank: A 10 K Q J 9 8 7, the ace being the highest, both in
cutting and in play.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKERS.</b></i> The game may be kept on a bézique marker, a
pull-up cribbage board, or with counters. Markers must be made
to score at least 5000 points. When a cribbage board is used, it is
usual to count the outside row of pegs as 10 each, the inner row
as 100 each, and the game pegs in the centre as 1000 each. If
counters are used, there must be for each player; four white, to
mark 10’s; one red to mark 50; nine blue to mark 100’s; and four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
coppers to mark 1000 each. These counters are moved from left
to right of the player as the points accrue. In whatever manner
the count is kept, it should be distinctly visible to both persons, as
playing to the score is very important.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> Rubicon Bézique is played for so much a hundred
points, and in settling up, all fractions of a hundred are disregarded,
unless they are necessary to decide the game. Ten cents a hundred
is the usual stake; sixpence in England. Games are seldom
worth less than one or two thousand points.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Rubicon Bézique is played by two persons, one
of whom is known as the <i><b>dealer</b></i>, and the other as the <i><b>pone</b></i>.
They cut for seats and deal, the player cutting the higher card
having first choice, and electing whether or not to deal himself.
In cutting, the cards rank as in play, the ace being the highest.
If a player exposes more than one card, he must cut again.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> The cards are thoroughly shuffled, and presented
to the pone to be cut. At least five cards must be left in
each packet. The dealer then distributes the cards three at a time,
first to his adversary and then to himself, for three rounds, so that
each player receives nine cards. No trump is turned; but the first
marriage declared and scored is the trump suit for that deal. The
undealt portion of the pack, called the <i><b>stock</b></i> or <i><b>talon</b></i>, is slightly
spread between the two players, and a little to the left of the dealer.
If in spreading the stock any card is found to be exposed, there
must be a new deal by the same dealer.</p>

<p><i><b>Misdealing.</b></i> A misdeal does not lose the deal, but in some
cases a new deal is at the option of the pone. If the dealer exposes
a card belonging to his adversary or to the stock, the pone
may demand a new deal; but if either player exposes any of his
own cards, the deal stands good. If too many cards are given to
either player, and the error is discovered before the dealer plays
to the first trick, there must be a new deal. If either player has
too few cards, the pone may demand a new deal, or may allow the
dealer to supply the deficiency from the top of the stock. If any
card is found exposed in the pack, there must be a new deal. If
any card faced in the stock is not discovered until the first trick
has been played to by the dealer, the exposed card must be turned
face down, without disturbing its position. If the pack is found to
be imperfect, the deal in which it is discovered is void; but all
previous scores or cuts made with that pack stand good.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The pone takes up and examines
his nine cards. If he finds himself without King, Queen
or Jack of any suit, he immediately shows his hand to the dealer,
and marks fifty points for <i><b>carte blanche</b></i>. Whether he has carte
blanche or not, he begins the play by leading any card he pleases.
If the dealer has carte blanche, he must show and score it before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
playing to the first trick. Players are not obliged to follow suit,
nor to trump; but may renounce or trump at pleasure until the
stock is exhausted, after which the method of play undergoes a
change. Until the first marriage is declared and scored there is
no trump suit. If the second player in any trick follows suit, the
higher card wins. Trumps win plain suits. If identical cards are
played to the same trick, such as two club aces, the leader wins.</p>

<p>The tricks are left face upward on the table until an ace or
Ten is played, for tricks not containing either of these cards are of
no value. When an ace or Ten is played, the winner of the trick
gathers in all the cards that have accumulated, and turns them
face down in front of him. These counting cards are called
<i><b>brisques</b></i>, and if a player neglects to gather the brisques he wins,
his adversary may do so when next he wins a trick, whether the
trick he wins contains a brisque or not; the fact that there is a
brisque on the table is sufficient.</p>

<p><i><b>Declaring.</b></i> The winner of any trick, before leading for the
next trick, has the privilege of announcing and scoring any one of
certain combinations that he may hold in his hand. After, or in the
absence of any such announcement, and before leading for the
next trick, he draws one card from the top of the stock, and places
it in his hand, without showing or naming it. His adversary then
draws the next card, so that each restores the number of cards in
his hand to nine. This method of playing, announcing, and drawing
is continued until the stock is exhausted.</p>

<p>If a player who has already announced carte blanche finds that
the first card he draws from the stock is not a King, Queen or
Jack, he shows it to his adversary, and scores another fifty points
for another carte blanche. This may be continued until he draws
one of those cards. Carte blanche cannot be scored at all unless
held before a card is played; that is, it must be dealt to the player
originally.</p>

<p>All combinations announced and scored must be left face upward
on the table, but the cards still form part of the player’s
hand, and may be led or played at any time, although they must
not again be taken in hand until the stock is exhausted.</p>

<p>The first marriage announced and scored, no matter by which
player, makes the <i><b>trump suit</b></i> for that deal; but a player with a
marriage on the table is not obliged to announce it if he does not
wish to make that suit the trump.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in Play.</b></i> If a player leads out of turn, and
his adversary plays to the lead, whether intentionally or otherwise,
the trick stands good. If the adversary calls attention to the error,
the card led out of turn may be taken back without penalty.</p>

<p>If, after playing to the first trick, one player is found to have
more than his right number of cards, the English rules say that
the game is to be immediately abandoned, and the adversary of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
player in error is to add 1300 points to his score at the time the
error is discovered, together with all the points already scored by
the player in error; but the latter amount must not exceed 900.</p>

<p>The same penalties are enforced if one player has too many
cards and the other too few; but in the latter case the hand is
played out, the player not in fault scoring all he can.</p>

<p>If both players have more than their right number of cards, the
deal is void. If either has less than his proper number, his adversary
having the right number, the deal stands good, and there is
no penalty except that the player with the right number of cards
wins and scores for the last trick. If both have less than the right
number, the deal stands good, and the actual winner of the last
trick scores it.</p>

<p>It will be observed that these rules are quite different from the
French rules, which have been given in connection with the ordinary
game of Bézique. In France, it is always the custom to establish
the <i>status quo</i>, if possible, and to assume that the error was
quite unintentional. In England, all laws are based on the assumption
that your adversary is a rogue, and the penalties are absurdly
severe, but we have no authority to change them.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in Drawing.</b></i> If a player has forgotten to
take his card from the talon, and has played to the next trick, the
English laws compel him to play the remainder of the hand with
eight cards; the French laws give his adversary the option of calling
the deal void, or allowing the player in error to draw two cards
from the stock next time.</p>

<p>If a player draws two cards from the stock, instead of one, he
must show the second one to his adversary if he has seen it himself.
If it was his adversary’s card, he must show his own card also. If
he has not seen it, he may put it back without penalty. If he
draws out of turn, he must restore the card improperly drawn, and
if it belongs to his adversary, the player in error must show his
own card. If both players draw the wrong cards, there is no
remedy.</p>

<p>If the loser of any trick draws and looks at two cards from the
stock, his adversary may look at both cards of the following draw,
and may select either for himself. If he chooses the second card,
he need not show it.</p>

<p>If, on account of some undetected irregularity, an odd number of
cards remain in the stock, the last card must not be drawn.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> Each game is complete in
one deal, and the score of the loser is deducted from that of the
winner. The combinations which may be declared and scored are
the same as in Bézique, but owing to the use of four packs of
cards double combinations are much more frequent, and triple
combinations are not uncommon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief concern of the player must be, first of all, to save himself
from a rubicon; that is, either to reach 1000 points, or to score
as few points as possible. If he does not reach 1000, his adversary
will take whatever he has scored, and add them to his own, besides
1300 in addition for rubicon and brisques. For instance: At the
end of the hand A has scored 1200, and B has only 700. B is
rubiconed, and his 700 points are added to A’s 1200, together with
1300 more for a rubicon game and brisques; giving A a grand
total of 3200 points to nothing. Had B reached 1000, he would
have saved his rubicon, and A would have scored the difference
only, or 200 points, plus 500 for the game; 700 altogether.</p>

<p><i><b>Brisques.</b></i> The aces and Tens of each suit are of no value
unless it is necessary to count them to decide a tie, or to save a
rubicon. They are never scored during the play of the hand.</p>

<p><i><b>Declarations.</b></i> The combinations which may be announced
and scored during the play of the hand are divided into three
classes: A, Marriages and Sequences; B, Béziques; and C, Fours.
Only one combination can be scored at a time, and it must be announced
and laid on the table immediately after the player holding
it has won a trick, and before he draws his card from the
talon. If he draws without announcing, it is equivalent to saying
he has no declaration to make. Having drawn his card, even if he
has not looked at it, he cannot score any declaration until he wins
another trick. The various combinations and their values are as
follows:</p>

<p>Besides the foregoing, there is the score of fifty points for carte
blanche, which may be announced only before the first trick is
played to, and the score of fifty points for the winner of the last
trick of all.</p>

<p>In class A, the first marriage declared must of course count 40,
as it is the trump suit for that deal. In class C, the four court
cards may be of different suits, or any two or more of them may
be of the same suit.</p>

<p>The rules governing declarations are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The player making the declaration must have won the previous
trick, and must make his announcement before drawing his card
from the stock. When the stock is exhausted, so that no cards
remain to be drawn, no announcements can be made.</p>

<p>Only one declaration can be scored at a time, so that a trick
must be won for every announcement made, or the combination
cannot be scored. This rule does not prevent a player from making
two or more announcements at the same time; but he can
score only one of them.</p>

<p>A player cannot make a lower declaration with cards which form
part of a higher combination already shown in the same class.
For instance:&mdash;Marriages and sequences belong to the same class.
If a sequence has been declared, the player cannot take from it
the King and Queen, and score for the marriage; neither can he
add a new Queen to the King already used in the sequence, because
the higher combination was scored first. The same rule
applies to lower and higher béziques. But if the lower combination
is first shown and scored&mdash;the marriage&mdash;the A 10 J may be
added afterward, on winning another trick, and the sequence
scored. This rule does not apply to cards belonging to combinations
in different classes. A Queen used in class A may be
used over again in both B and C classes.</p>

<p><i><b>Re-forming Combinations.</b></i> The chief peculiarity in Rubicon
Bézique is that combinations which have been laid on the
table and scored may be broken up, re-formed, and scored again
indefinitely. For instance: A player has declared royal sequence,
and scored 250 points for it. He may play away the Ace,
breaking up the sequence, and upon winning the trick lay down
another Ace, re-forming the sequence, and scoring 250 points
again. He might repeat the same process with the Ten, King,
Queen and Jack, and in six successive tricks he would score this
royal sequence six times, making 1500 points out of it. In actual
play it is not necessary to go through the formality of playing
away a card from the combination on the table, and then replacing
it, for it amounts to the same thing if the new card in the
hand is led or played, and the fresh combination claimed.</p>

<p>Marriages, béziques and fours may be broken up and re-formed
in the same way. After declaring 100 Aces, the player may lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
or play another Ace, and claim another 100 Aces, scoring them
when he wins a trick. In this way, eight Aces actually held might
score 500 points. In the bézique combinations, a new card simply
re-forms the single bézique. In order to score double, triple, or
quadruple bézique, all the cards forming the combination must be
on the table at one time, but they may be played and scored one
after the other, cumulatively. For instance: A player holding
quadruple bézique and showing all eight cards at once would score
4500 only; the minor béziques would be lost. If he had time, and
could win tricks enough, he might show the single first, scoring
40, then the double, scoring 500, then the triple, scoring 1500, and
finally the quadruple, scoring 4500, which would yield him a grand
total of 6540 points. He might declare marriage in hearts, and
afterward play three more heart Queens, scoring each marriage,
and then three heart Kings, scoring three more marriages. These
would all be new combinations.</p>

<p><i><b>Double Declarations.</b></i> These are carried forward in the
manner already described for the ordinary game. Suppose a
player has two spade Kings on the table, and shows double bézique.
He of course marks the more valuable score, 500, and
simply claims the marriages by saying: “With twenty and twenty
to score.” On winning another trick he is not compelled to score
the previous announcement if he has any other or better to make.
He might have two more Queens, and would announce: “Sixty
Queens, with twenty and twenty to score.” If he scores one of
the announcements held over, he still carries on the other.</p>

<p>When announcements are carried forward in this manner, it
must be remembered that the cards must still be on the table
when the time comes to score them. If one of them has been led
or played, or the stock is exhausted before the player wins another
trick, the score held over is lost.</p>

<p><i><b>Time.</b></i> On account of the great number of combinations possible
at Rubicon Bézique, it is very seldom that a player succeeds
in scoring everything he holds. He is allowed to count the cards
remaining in the talon, provided he does not disturb their order.
This count is often important toward the end of the hand. For
instance: You know from the cards you hold, and those played,
that your adversary must have in his hand the cards that will make
a double bézique on the table into a triple bézique, which would
give him 1500 points. If, on counting the stock, you find only six
cards remain, and you have three certain winning trumps to lead,
you can shut out his 1500 by exhausting the stock before he can
win a trick.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregular Announcements.</b></i> If a player announces a combination
which he does not show; such as fours, when he has
only three, which he may easily do by mistaking a Jack for a King,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
<i>his</i> adversary can compel him not only to take down the score erroneously
marked, but to lead or play one of the three Kings.
A player may be called upon to lead or play cards from other erroneous
declarations in the same manner; but if he has the right
card or cards in his hand, he is permitted to amend his error, provided
he has not drawn a card from the stock in the meantime.</p>

<p><i><b>The Last Nine Tricks.</b></i> When the stock is exhausted, all
announcements are at an end, and the players take back into their
hands all the cards upon the table which may remain from the
combinations declared in the course of play. The winner of the
previous trick then leads any card he pleases, but for the last
nine tricks the second player in each must not only follow suit, but
must win the trick if he can, either with a superior card or with a
trump. Any player failing to follow suit or to win a trick, when
able to do so, may be compelled to take back his cards to the point
where the error occurred, and to replay the hand from that point.
In France he is penalised by counting nothing from that point on,
either for brisques or for the last trick.</p>

<p>The winner of the <i><b>last trick</b></i> scores fifty points for it immediately.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> Each deal is a complete game in itself, and the
winner is the player who has scored the most points for carte
blanche, combinations, and the last trick. The brisques are not
counted, unless they are necessary to decide a tie, or save a rubicon.</p>

<p>The value of the game is determined by deducting the lesser
score from the higher, and then adding 500 points to the remainder.
In this deduction all fractions of a hundred are disregarded. For
instance: A’s score is 1830; while B’s is 1260. A wins 1800, less
the 1200 scored by B, which leaves 600; to this must be added the
500 points for game, making the total value of A’s game 1100
points.</p>

<p>If the scores are very nearly equal, being within one or two
hundred points of each other, the tricks taken in by each player
are turned over, and the brisques are counted, each player adding
to his score ten points for every brisque he has won. Suppose
that after the last trick had been played and scored, A’s total was
1260, and B’s 1140. This is close enough to justify B in demanding
a count of the brisques. It is found that A has seven only,
while B has twenty-five. This shows B to be the winner of the
game, with a total score of 1390 to A’s 1330.</p>

<p>If the difference between the final scores is less than 100 points,
after adding the brisques and throwing off the fractions, the
player with the higher score adds 100 points for bonus. In the
case just given, B’s final score is equal to A’s, after dropping the
fractions from both; so he would add 100 for bonus to the 500
for game, and win 600 points altogether.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Rubicons.</b></i> If the lower score is less than 1000, no matter
what the higher score may be, the loser is rubiconed, and all the
points he has scored are <i>added</i> to the score of the winner, instead
of being deducted. In addition to this, the winner adds a double
game, or 1000 points, for the rubicon, and 300 points for all the
brisques, no matter who actually won them. For example: A’s
score is 920, and B’s 440. It is not necessary to count the
brisques to see that A wins and B is rubiconed. A adds B’s 400
to his own 900, making his score 1300, and to this total he adds
1300 for rubicon and brisques, making the value of his game 2600
points altogether.</p>

<p>The loser is not rubiconed if he can bring his total score to 1000
by adding his brisques. Suppose A has 1740 and B 850. The
brisques are counted, and it is found that B has eighteen, making
his score 1030, and saving his rubicon. A adds his fourteen
brisques, making his total 1880, which makes the value of his
game 1800, minus B’s 1000, plus 500 for the game, or 1300 altogether.</p>

<p>If B’s brisques did not prove sufficient to save the rubicon, A
would count them all. Suppose that in the foregoing case B had
taken in only eleven brisques, leaving his total 990. As this does
not save the rubicon the game is reckoned as if the brisques had
not been counted at all, and A wins 1800, plus B’s 800, plus 1300
for rubicon and brisques; 3900 altogether.</p>

<p>If the player who is rubiconed has scored less than 100 points,
the winner takes 100 for bonus, in addition to the 1300 for rubicon
and brisques.</p>

<p>When a series of games is played between the same individuals,
it is usual to keep the net results on a sheet of paper, setting down
the hundreds only, and to settle at the end of the sitting.</p>

<p><i><b>Suggestions for Good Play</b></i> will be found in Binocle.</p>

<p class="tb"><i><b>CHINESE BÉZIQUE</b></i> is Rubicon Bézique with six packs
of cards shuffled together and used as one. The counts run into
enormous figures, and 6000 is not an uncommon score for the
winner.</p>

<p>In <i><b>CHOUETTE BÉZIQUE</b></i>, one of several players agrees
to take all bets, and has the choice of deal and seats without cutting.
His adversaries may consult together in playing against him.
If the chouette player wins, one of his opponents takes the loser’s
place; but if he loses, the same player opposes him for the next
game. The adversaries usually cut to decide which of them shall
play the first game against the chouette player, the highest card
having the privilege. If there are four players, two may play
against two, each consulting with his partner and sharing his bets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<h3>BINOCLE.</h3>

<p>The word Binocle is spelt in many different ways, all of which,
are, however, phonetic equivalents of the correct one. The word
is probably derived from the French word “binage,” which was
the name given to the combination known as “binocle,” and which
seemed a better term than “cinq cents” as the game was no longer
500 points up. In all German works on card games the name is
spelt as we give it; but the pronunciation of the initial “b” in the
German is so near that of “p,” that “Pinocle” is nearer the correct
spelling than any other form. There is no authority for the
introduction of the “h,” which has led some persons to think the
word a compound of “bis” and “knochle,” and has given rise to
the forms: binochle, pinochle, pinuchle, pinucle, penucle, penuchle,
penuckle and pinuckel, all of which may be found in various
works on card games.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Binocle is played with two packs of twenty-four cards
each, all below the Nine being deleted, and the two packs being
then shuffled together, and used as one. The cards rank A 10 K
Q J 9, the Ace being the highest, both in cutting and in play.</p>

<p><i><b>COUNTERS.</b></i> The game is 1000 points, and is usually
scored with counters, each player being provided with four white,
worth 10 each; four blue, worth 100 each; one red, worth 50, and
a copper cent or a button, which represents 500. These counters
are placed on the left of the player at the beginning of the game,
and are moved over to his right as the points accrue. The game
is sometimes kept on a cribbage board, each player starting at 21,
and going twice round to the game-hole, reckoning each peg as
10 points.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> Binocle is played for so much a game of 1000
points, and the moment either player either actually reaches or
claims to have reached that number, the game is at an end. If
his claim is correct, he wins; if it is not, his adversary takes the
stakes, no matter what the score may be.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Binocle is played by two persons, one of whom
is known as the <i><b>dealer</b></i>, and the other as the <i><b>pone</b></i>. They cut
for the choice of seats and deal, and the player cutting the higher
card may deal or not, as he pleases. It is usual for the player
having the choice to make his adversary deal. A player exposing
more than one card must cut again.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> After the cards are thoroughly shuffled, they
are presented to the pone to be cut. At least five cards must be
left in each packet. The dealer then distributes the cards four at
a time for three rounds, giving to his adversary first, and then to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
himself. The twenty-fifth card is turned up for the trump. If
this card is a Nine, the dealer claims <i><b>dix</b></i>, and counts ten for it
immediately. The trump card is laid aside, and the remainder of
the pack, which is called the <i><b>stock</b></i>, or <i><b>talon</b></i>, is slightly spread,
to facilitate the process of drawing cards from it, and to be sure
that none of the cards remaining in the stock are exposed. The
trump is usually placed face up under the last card of the stock.</p>

<p>In <i><b>Sixty-four-card Binocle</b></i>, the Sevens and Eights are
added to the pack. There are then two ways to play: If eight cards
are dealt to each player, the game is simply Bézique, except for
some minor details relating to the combinations and their value.
These are usually disregarded, and the regular game of Bézique is
played. If twelve cards are dealt to each player, the game is the
same as the one about to be described, but with eight cards added
to the pack, and the Seven taking the place of the Nine for dix.</p>

<p><i><b>Misdealing.</b></i> If the dealer exposes a card belonging to his
adversary or to the stock, the pone may demand a new deal; but
if either player exposes any of his own cards the deal stands good.
If too many cards are given to either player, and the error is discovered
before the dealer plays to the first trick, there must be a
new deal. If either player has too few cards, the pone may demand
a new deal, or may allow the dealer to supply the deficiency
from the top of the stock. If any card is found exposed in the
pack, there must be a new deal. If a card faced in the stock is
not discovered until the first trick has been played to by the dealer,
the exposed card must be turned face down, without disturbing its
position. If the pack is found to be imperfect, the deal in which it
is discovered is void; but all previous scores and cuts made with
that pack stand good. In all misdeals the same dealer deals again.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> After the trump is turned,
the pone begins by leading any card he pleases. The second
player is not obliged to follow suit, nor to trump; but may renounce
or trump at pleasure until the stock is exhausted, after
which the method of play undergoes a change. If the second
player follows suit in any trick, the higher card wins. Trumps
win plain suits. If identical cards are played to the same trick,
such as two club Jacks, the leader wins.</p>

<p>The winner of the trick takes in the cards, turning them face
down, but before he leads for the next trick he has the privilege of
announcing and scoring any one of certain combinations that he
may hold in his hand. After, or in the absence of any such announcement,
and before leading for the next trick, he draws a
card from the top of the stock, and places it in his hand, without
showing or naming it. His adversary then draws the next card,
so that each player restores the number of cards in his hand to
twelve. This method of playing, announcing, and drawing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
the talon is continued until the stock is exhausted. The A 10 K
Q J of each suit have certain counting values, which will be
described further on.</p>

<p>All combinations announced and scored must be laid face upward
on the table; but the cards still form part of the player’s
hand, and may be led or played at any time, although they must
not again be taken in hand until the stock is exhausted.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in Play.</b></i> If either player leads out of turn,
and his adversary plays to the lead, whether intentionally or otherwise,
the trick stands good. If the adversary calls attention to
the error, the card may be taken back without penalty.</p>

<p>If at any time it is discovered that a player has too many cards,
his adversary may either claim a fresh deal, or may compel him to
play without drawing from the talon until the number of his cards
is reduced to twelve. The player with too many cards is not
allowed to make or score any announcements until he has his right
number of cards. If a player has too few cards, his adversary
may either claim a fresh deal, or allow him to make good the
deficiency by drawing from the stock.</p>

<p>Any player looking at any but the last trick turned down, forfeits
his entire score for “cards.”</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in Drawing.</b></i> If a player has forgotten to
take a card from the talon, and has played to the next trick, his
adversary may elect to call the deal void, or to allow him to
draw two cards next time.</p>

<p>If a player has drawn two cards from the stock, instead of one,
he must show the second one to his adversary if he has seen it
himself. If it was his adversary’s card, he must show his own
card also. If he has not seen it, he may put it back without penalty.
If he draws out of turn, he must restore the card improperly
drawn, and if it belongs to his adversary, the player in error
must show his own card. If both draw the wrong cards there is
no remedy, and each must keep what he gets. If the loser of
any trick draws and looks at two cards from the stock, his adversary
may look at both cards of the following draw, and may select
either for himself. If he chooses the second card, which his
adversary has not seen, he need not show it.</p>

<p>If, on account of some undetected irregularity, an even number
of cards remain in the stock, the last card must not be drawn.
The winner of the trick takes the last but one, and the loser takes
the trump card.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> The aim of each player is to
reach 1000 points before his adversary, and the one first reaching
that number, and announcing it, wins the game. Points are
scored for <i><b>dix</b></i>, <i><b>melds</b></i>, the <i><b>last trick</b></i>, and for <i><b>cards</b></i>, which
are the counting cards in tricks won.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Melds.</b></i> The various combinations which are declared during
the play of the hand are called melds, from the German word melden,
to announce. These melds are divided into three classes:
<i>a</i>, Marriages and Sequences; <i>b</i>, Binocles; and <i>c</i>, Fours. Only one
combination can be announced at a time, and it must be melded
immediately after the player holding it has won a trick, and before
he draws his card from the stock. If he draws without announcing,
even if he has not seen the card drawn, he cannot meld anything
until he wins another trick. The melds and their values are
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The third meld in class B is not often played in America. The
count for it is the same, 80 points, whether the marriage in spades
is the trump suit or not. It will be observed that the court cards
in class C must be of different suits in Binocle, whereas, in Bézique,
any four court cards may be declared. The following rules
govern all classes of declarations:&mdash;</p>

<p>The player making the declaration must have won the previous
trick, and must meld before drawing his card from the stock.
When the stock is exhausted, so that no cards remain to be drawn,
no further announcements can be made.</p>

<p>Only one meld can be scored at a time, so that a trick must be
made for every announcement made, or the combination cannot be
scored, and a fresh card must be played from the hand for every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
fresh meld. This is a very important rule, and little understood.
Suppose a player holds four Kings and four Queens. The total
count for the various combinations these cards will make is 220:
two plain-suit marriages, 20 each; royal marriage, 40; four Kings,
80; and four Queens, 60. As only one combination can be scored
for each trick won, and as the player must lay down at least one
fresh card for each successive meld, it is evident that if he
begins with the 80 Kings, and then marries each of them in turn,
when he comes to the fourth Queen he will have to sacrifice the 20
for a marriage in order to score the 60 for the four Queens. He
cannot score both, or he will not be complying with the rule about
the fresh card from the hand for every meld. That is why four
Kings and four Queens are never worth 240, but only 220.</p>

<p>A player cannot meld cards which have already been used to
form higher combinations in the same class; but he may use
cards melded in lower combinations to form more valuable ones
in the same class, provided he adds at least one fresh card from
his hand. The principle is that cards may be <i><b>added</b></i> to melds
already shown, but they cannot be <i><b>taken away</b></i> to form other
combinations in the same class. For example: Royal marriage
has been melded and scored. The player may <i><b>add</b></i> to this the
Ace, Ten, and Jack of trumps to make the sequence, which is a
more valuable combination in the same class. But if the first
meld is the sequence, he cannot <i><b>take away</b></i> from the sequence
the card or cards to form a marriage. A new Queen added to the
King already in the sequence will not make a marriage; because
it is not the Queen that is added to the sequence, but the King
that is taken away.</p>

<p>The same rule applies to the binocles. If a player has scored
double binocle, he can not afterward take away two cards to meld
a single binocle; but if the single binocle has been melded and
scored first, he may add two more cards, and score the double
binocle. He cannot score the second single, and then claim the
double, because some new card must be added to form a new
meld in the same class.</p>

<p>If four Kings are melded and scored, the other four may be
added later; but if the eight Kings are first melded, the score for
the four Kings is lost.</p>

<p>Cards may be taken away from one combination to form less
valuable combinations in another class. For instance: Four
Jacks have been melded; the diamond Jack may be taken away
to form a binocle with the spade Queen. If spades are trumps,
and the sequence has been melded, the Queen may be taken away
to form a binocle, because the binocle is in a different class of
melds; but the Queen cannot be used to form a marriage, because
the sequence and the marriage are in the same class. As there
are three classes, one card may be used three separate times.
The spade Queen, for instance, may be used in a marriage, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
binocle, and in four Queens, and these melds may be made in any
order.</p>

<p>Cards once used in combinations cannot again be used in melds
of equal value belonging to the same class; and combinations
once broken up cannot be re-formed by the addition of fresh cards.
For instance: Four Kings have been melded, and one of them
has been used in the course of play. The player cannot add
a new King to the three remaining, and meld four Kings again.
A marriage in hearts has been melded, and the King played away.
A new King will not make another marriage with the old Queen.
A binocle has been melded, and the Jack has been played;
another Jack will not make a new binocle with the old Queen.</p>

<p><i><b>Double Declarations.</b></i> When a player makes a meld containing
certain cards which will form a counting combination
with other cards already on the table, it is called a double declaration,
that is, a meld in two different classes at the same time.
For instance: A player has melded and scored four Kings, and on
winning another trick he melds binocle. Two of the cards on the
table form a marriage in spades, and as the marriage is in a different
class from either of the other melds, he may claim it and
score it; but if he does, he will lose the score for the binocle, being
prevented by the rule about a fresh card from the hand for each
individual meld. The only way to secure both scores would be to
meld the marriage first, and afterward to lay down the Jack and
meld the binocle.</p>

<p><i><b>Time.</b></i> On account of the number of combinations possible,
and the fact that there are only twelve tricks to be played before
the scores for announcements are barred, it frequently happens
that a player has not time to score everything he holds. He is
allowed to count the cards remaining in the talon, provided he
does not disturb their order, and it is often important to do so
toward the end of a hand.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring Dix.</b></i> If a player holds or draws the Nine of trumps,
he has the privilege of exchanging it for the turn-up card, and
scoring ten points for dix. The exchange must be made immediately
after winning a trick, and before drawing his card from the
stock. Should the turn-up be a Nine, the exchange may still be
made and scored; and if one player has already exchanged a
Nine for the turn-up, the second Nine may still be exchanged for
the first, and scored. A player cannot score dix and any other
combination at the same time. For this reason a player whose
time is short will often forego the dix score altogether unless the
trump card is valuable.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregular Melds.</b></i> If a player announces a combination
which he does not show, such as fours when he has three only,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
which he may easily do by mistaking a Jack for a King, his adversary
can compel him not only to take down the score erroneously
marked, but to lead or play one of the three Kings. A player
may be called upon to lead or play cards from other erroneous
declarations in the same manner, but if he has the right card or
cards in his hand, he may amend his error, provided he has not
drawn a card from the stock in the meantime.</p>

<p><i><b>The Last Twelve Tricks.</b></i> When the stock is exhausted all
announcements are at an end, and the players take back into their
hands all the cards upon the table which may remain from the combinations
declared in the course of play. Should a player take up
his cards before playing to the last trick, he may be called upon to
lay his entire hand on the table.</p>

<p>The winner of the previous trick then leads any card he pleases;
but for the last twelve tricks the second player in each must not
only follow suit, but must win the trick if he can, either with a superior
card or with a trump. Any player failing to follow suit or to
win a trick, when able to do so, may be compelled to take back his
cards to the point where the error occurred, and to replay the
hand from that point on. The penalty for the <i><b>revoke</b></i> varies in
different places, but the general rule is for the revoking player to
lose his entire count for “cards.”</p>

<p>The winner of <i><b>the last trick</b></i> scores ten points for it; and the
players then turn over the tricks they have taken, and count their
score for “cards.”</p>

<p><i><b>Cards.</b></i> The five highest cards in each suit count toward game
for the player winning them. The Ace is worth 11 points, the
Ten 10, the King 4, the Queen 3, and the Jack, 2, no matter what
the suit may be, so that there are 240 points for cards to be divided
between the players in each deal. It is usual for only one
to count, the other checking him, and taking the difference between
the total and 240. Cards are not scored as the tricks are taken
in, but after the hand is over and the 10 points have been scored
for the last trick.</p>

<p>From this it might be imagined that no notice was taken of the
counting value of the cards taken in during the play. Early in the
game this is true; but toward the end each player must keep very
careful <i><b>mental count</b></i> of the value of his tricks, although he is
not allowed to make any note of it, nor to score it. When either
player knows, by adding his mental count to his score for melds
and dix, that he has made points enough to win the game, he stops
the play by knocking on the table. He then turns over his tricks
and counts his cards, to show his adversary that he has won the
game. Even if both have enough to go out, the player wins who
knocks first, provided his count is correct. If the player who
knocks is mistaken, and cannot count out, he loses the game, no
matter what his adversary’s score may be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>If neither knocks, and at the end of the hand both players are
found to have points enough to put them out, neither wins the
game. If the game is 1000 points, it must be continued to 1250.
Should both reach that point without knocking, it must be continued
to 1500. If neither knocks, and only one has enough points
to put him out, he wins the game on its merits.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> The game is usually 1000 points. All scores for
dix, melds, and the last trick, are counted as soon as made; but
the players are not allowed to keep any record of the score for
cards, nor to go back over their tricks to refresh their memory.
Any player going back further than the last trick turned and
quitted, forfeits his entire score for cards. The player first correctly
announcing that he has reached 1000 points, wins the game,
no matter what his adversary’s score may be; but if the announcement
is incorrect, he loses the game.</p>

<p>Should a player score more than he is entitled to; as, for instance,
scoring 80 for four Queens, his adversary may take down
the superfluous score, 20 points in this instance, and may add it to
his own score for a penalty.</p>

<p><i><b>CHEATING.</b></i> Apart from the usual weapons of false
shuffles, strippers cut to locate or pull out the binocle cards, and
the opportunities always offered to the greek when the cards are
dealt three or four at a time, the bézique family of games are particularly
adapted to the use of marked cards. These will show the
philosopher the exact value of both the cards in the next draw, and
will enable him to vary his play accordingly. It is for this reason
that in France the top card of the stock is always drawn by the
same player, no matter which wins the trick. In Rubicon Bézique,
a person should be very familiar with the movements peculiar to
dealing seconds before he ventures to play in a public café, or he
may find his adversary with the most astonishing run of repeated
combinations, and will be rubiconed almost every game.</p>

<p>Never play with a man who cuts the pack with both hands,
watches the cards closely as he deals, or looks intently at the top
of the stock before he plays to the current trick. Players who
have a nervous affection which makes them pass over too many
counters at once will also bear watching. Colour blindness may
lead them to take over a blue instead of a white in a close game.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> The general
principles of play are much the same in all the Bézique family of
games.</p>

<p>It is usually best to give your adversary the deal, because the
first lead is often an advantage, especially if the turn-up is valuable,
and you have a dix, or if you want to make the trump in
Rubicon Bézique.</p>

<p>It is seldom right to make the trump unless you have one or two
of the sequence cards with the marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>The Lead</b></i> is a disadvantage unless you have something to
declare, or there is a brisque in the trick, or you can get home the
Ten of a plain suit. The Tens are of no value in plain suits except
as brisques, for they enter into no combination with other
cards except in Penchant, Cinq-cents, and Rubicon. If the trick
is of no value, or you have nothing important to declare, get rid of
your small cards, and lead them when you do not want to retain
the lead. The lead is sometimes necessary to prevent your adversary
from declaring, especially toward the end of the hand. If
you have led a brisque and won the trick, it is better to lead another
brisque in the same suit than to change.</p>

<p>Aces are better leads than Kings or Queens, for the court cards
can be married, and you may never get 100 Aces. Kings are
better leads than Queens, especially if the Queens are spades.
Jacks are better than either, but the Jack of diamonds should be
kept as long as possible. If you have to decide between two combinations,
one of which you must sacrifice, lead that which is of
the smallest value, or the least likely to be restored. For instance:
If your adversary has shown one or two Kings, but no Ace, and
you have three of each, you are more likely to get 100 Aces than
80 Kings.</p>

<p>If you hold duplicate cards, especially in trumps, play the one on
the table, not the one in your hand.</p>

<p><i><b>Brisques.</b></i> Beginners often overlook the importance of brisques.
Every time you allow your adversary to take in a brisque which
you might have won, you make a difference of twenty points in the
score. While you are hugging three Aces, waiting for a fourth,
your adversary may get home all his Tens, and then turn up with
your fourth Ace in his hand.</p>

<p><i><b>Discarding.</b></i> It is usually best to settle upon one of two suits
or combinations, and to discard the others, for you cannot play for
everything. Having once settled on what to play for, it is generally
bad policy to change unless something better turns up.</p>

<p>Your adversary’s discards will often be a guide as to the combinations
he hopes to make, and will show you that you need not
keep certain cards. For instance: If a binocle player discards or
plays two heart Kings, it is unlikely that he has either of the
Queens, and you may reasonably hope for 60 Queens; but it will
be impossible for you to make anything out of your Kings but
marriages. In Bézique, where Kings may be of the same suit in
fours, you will have a slightly better chance for 80 Kings on
account of your adversary’s discards, because he certainly has no
more, as he would not break up three Kings.</p>

<p><i><b>Declaring.</b></i> It is often a nice point to decide whether or not
you can afford to make minor declarations while holding higher
ones in your hand. In Rubicon many players will give up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
trump marriage if they have the sequence, especially with a good
chance of re-forming it several times with duplicate cards. The
number of cards in hand will often be the best guide. In Rubicon,
if you held trump sequence and double bézique, it would be
better to declare the sequence first, and to lead the card you
drew. One of the trump sequence on the table would then be
free to regain the lead and declare the double bézique; but if the
bézique was declared first, the sequence might have to be broken
into to regain the lead. With a plain-suit sequence and four
Aces, declare the Aces first. They will then be free to win tricks
for the purpose of making other declarations.</p>

<p>It is seldom right to show the bézique cards in other combinations,
and four Jacks is a very bad meld, because it shows your
adversary that he cannot hope for double bézique. By holding up
bézique cards, even if you know they are of no use to you, you
may lead your adversary to break up his hand, hoping to draw
the card or cards you hold.</p>

<p><i><b>Trumps.</b></i> Small trumps may be used to advantage in winning
brisques, but you should keep at least one small trump to
get the lead at critical periods of the hand, or to make an important
declaration. It is bad policy to trump in to make minor
declarations, unless your time is short. It is seldom right to lead
the trump Ace, except at the end of the hand, or when you have
duplicates, but leading high trumps to prevent an adversary from
declaring further is a common stratagem, if you know from the
cards in your hand, and those played, that your adversary may
get the cards to meld something of importance.</p>

<p><i><b>The Last Tricks.</b></i> Before you play to the last trick, give
yourself time to note the cards your adversary has on the table,
and compare them with your own, so that you may play the last
tricks to advantage. If you wait until after playing to the last
trick, he may gather up his cards so quickly that you will be unable
to remember them. At Rubicon it is not always advisable
to win the last trick. If your adversary is rubiconed in any case,
you may add 100 points to your own score by giving him the 50
for the last trick, which may put him across the line into another
hundred.</p>

<h3>THREE-HANDED BINOCLE.</h3>

<p>When three persons play, the entire pack is dealt out, giving
sixteen cards to each player, four at a time, and turning up the last
for the trump. There is no stock. Each plays for himself, and
must keep his own score. A triangular cribbage board is very
useful for this purpose.</p>

<p><i><b>Dix.</b></i> Each player in turn, beginning on the dealer’s left, may
show the Nine of trumps if he holds it, and exchange it for the
trump card. Should two Nines be shown by different players,
the one on the dealer’s left takes the turn-up trump. Even if the
dealer has a Nine himself, he is not allowed to keep the turn-up
trump. If the same player holds both Nines he may score twenty
on winning a trick. A player with 990 up is not out if he turns up
the Nine. He must win a trick.</p>

<p><i><b>Melds.</b></i> All the combinations have the same value as in the
ordinary game, but all melds are laid upon the table before a card
is played. When he lays down his cards, a player may make as
many combinations with them as he can, just as he would in the
ordinary game if he had plenty of time. If he has the trump
sequence, he may lay down the marriage first, then the A 10 J. If
he has double binocle, he may lay down the single first, and then
the other, claiming the count for both. Four Kings and four
Queens count 220. The trump sequence counts 190.</p>

<p>No player is allowed to meld after he has played to the first trick.
If he discovers he had more to meld, but has played a card, the
unannounced score is lost. An interesting variation is sometimes
introduced by allowing the other players to claim any score overlooked
by the one who melds.</p>

<p>The total number of points claimed by each player is simply
announced, but not scored. The player must win a trick before
he can score anything; but the first trick he wins entitles him to
score everything he has announced, including dix. It is usual to
put the melds on a slate, and to rub them out if the player does
not win a trick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Playing.</b></i> The melds are all taken in hand again before play
begins. The eldest hand leads for the first trick any card he
pleases, and the others must follow suit if able, and must win the
trick if they can, either with a higher card or with a trump. If
the third hand cannot win the trick, he is still obliged to follow
suit if he can; but if he has none of the suit led, and the second
hand has already put on a better trump than any held by third
hand, the latter must under-trump if he can. The winner of one
trick leads for the next, as in the ordinary game. The winner of
the sixteenth or last trick counts ten points for it at once.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> The points for dix, melds, and the last trick are all
scored with the counters in the ordinary way, but the score for
cards must be kept mentally. The moment any player correctly
announces that he has reached 1000 points, he wins the game, no
matter what the others may have scored. If his claim is not correct,
he retires, and the two remaining players finish alone. If
neither wins the game that deal, they play the next deal as in
ordinary two-handed Binocle, with a stock, the ultimate winner
taking the stakes. If it has been agreed that the lowest score pays
when the first player goes out, the game is ended as soon as one
retires. If two players reach 1000 points without either having
claimed the game, they must both go on to 1250; but if the third
player reaches and announces 1000 before either of the others
reaches 1250, he wins the game.</p>

<p><i><b>The Revoke.</b></i> The individual player in error loses his entire
score for “cards.” The bidder cannot be set back if either adversary
revokes. He may demand that the hand be played out
if he thinks he can get a good score.</p>

<h3>GAIGEL.</h3>

<p>This is sometimes called <i><b>Short Binocle</b></i>. It is played by two
persons with the forty-eight card pack, and the melds are reduced
to the following values:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="The values">
  <tr>
    <td>King and Queen of a plain suit</td>
    <td class="tdr">20</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Double marriage in the same suit</td>
    <td class="tdr">40</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>King and Queen of trumps</td>
    <td class="tdr">40</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Double marriage in trumps</td>
    <td class="tdr">80</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Any five Nines</td>
    <td class="tdr">101</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Two single marriages in the same suit cannot be melded at different
times. Game is 101 points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<h3>FOUR-HANDED BINOCLE.</h3>

<p>Four persons may play, each for himself, or two against two as
partners, sitting opposite each other. All the cards are dealt,
twelve to each player, four at a time, and the last is turned up for
the trump.</p>

<p><i><b>Melds</b></i> are not made until the player holding them has played to
the first trick. The eldest hand leads and then melds; the second
player plays and then melds, and so on. The card played to the
first trick may still be reckoned in the melds.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing.</b></i> The general rules of play are the same as in the
three-handed game; players being obliged to follow suit and to win
the trick if able to do so. The fourth player must win his partner’s
trick if he can, and any player who cannot follow suit to a trick
that is already trumped must under-trump if he is unable to over-trump.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> There are three ways to score: In the first, each
player must individually win a trick in order to score his melds.
In the second, when either partner wins a trick, the melds in both
hands may be scored. In both these the melds are kept separate.
In the third, when a player wins a trick he may combine his melds
with those of his partner to form fresh combinations, and the
scores are made as if the melds of the two partners were in one
hand; but cards previously played to the tricks cannot be used in
these fresh combinations. The cards must still be on the table,
unplayed. For this reason, in this style of game the melds are not
taken up until one of the partners wins a trick.</p>

<h3>AUCTION BINOCLE.</h3>

<p>In this variation, each of three or four players is for himself.
The forty-eight cards are dealt out, four at a time, but no trump is
turned. Beginning on the dealer’s left, each player in turn bids a
certain number of points for the privilege of naming the trump suit
and of having the lead for the first trick. There are no second
bids. If all pass, the dealer must bid twenty.</p>

<p>As soon as the trump is named, every player at the table makes
his own melds, which will be good if he wins a trick. The rules
for play are the same as in the ordinary three and four hand.</p>

<p>If four play as partners, two against two, the eldest hand always
leads for the first trick, no matter who the successful bidder may be.</p>

<p>The bidder always has the first count at the end of the hand,
and it is usual to play this game so many deals, instead of so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
points. At the end of six deals, for instance, the highest score is
the winner.</p>

<p>Sometimes this game is played with a widow, three cards when
three play, four when four play. Each player is allowed three bids,
and the successful bidder turns the widow face up, so that all may
see what it contained. He then takes the widow into his hand and
discards what he pleases, face down, to reduce his hand to the
same number of cards as the other players. The trump is not
named until after this discard. The bidder has the first lead and
also the first count. Six deals is a game.</p>

<h3>SIXTY-SIX.</h3>

<p>Sixty-six is one of the simplest forms of Bézique, and is an extremely
good game for two persons with one pack of cards.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards.</b></i> Sixty-six is played with a pack of twenty-four cards,
all below the Nine being deleted. The cards rank, A 10 K Q J 9;
the Ace being the highest, both in cutting and in play.</p>

<p><i><b>Markers.</b></i> The game may be kept with the small cards in the
unused portion of the pack, or with a whist marker or counters.
Anything that will score up to seven points will do.</p>

<p><i><b>Players.</b></i> The regular game is played by two persons, one of
whom is known as the dealer, and the other as the pone. They
cut for seats and deal, the highest cut having the choice.</p>

<p><i><b>Stakes.</b></i> Sixty-six is played for so much a game, or for so
much a point, the loser’s score being deducted from the winner’s.
If the loser has not scored at all, it is usually counted a double
game.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> The cards having been shuffled and presented to the
pone to be cut, the dealer gives six cards to each player, three at a
time, dealing first to his adversary. There are several ways of
making the trump, one of which should be agreed upon before
play begins. One way is for the pone to draw a card from the
top, the middle, or the bottom of the talon, after the dealer has
given each player his six cards. Another way is for the dealer to
turn up the seventh card, after dealing the first round of three to
each player. Another, and the one generally adopted in America,
is for the dealer to turn up the thirteenth card for the trump, after
giving six cards to each player. The trump card is left face upward
on the table, and is usually placed under the remainder of
the pack, which is slightly spread, face down, for the players to
draw from.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>The general rules for irregularities in the deal are the same as
in Binocle. A misdeal does not lose the deal.</p>

<p><i><b>Objects of the Game.</b></i> The object of the game, as its name
implies, is to count sixty-six. If a player can get sixty-six before
his adversary, he counts one point toward game. If he gets
sixty-six before his opponent gets thirty-three, which is called
<i><b>schneider</b></i>, he counts two. If he gets sixty-six before his adversary
wins a trick, which is called <i><b>schwartz</b></i>, he counts three.
The player first making seven points in this manner wins the
game.</p>

<p>A player may reach sixty-six by winning tricks containing certain
counting cards; by holding and announcing marriages, which
are the King and Queen of any suit; and by winning the last trick.</p>

<p>The various counts for these are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="The counts">
  <tr>
    <td>For King and Queen of trumps, <i><b>Royal Marriage</b></i>,</td>
    <td class="tdr">40</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For King and Queen of any plain suit, <i><b>Marriage</b></i>,</td>
    <td class="tdr">20</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the Ace of any suit,</td>
    <td class="tdr">11</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the Ten of any suit,</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the King of any suit,</td>
    <td class="tdr">4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the Queen of any suit,</td>
    <td class="tdr">3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the Jack of any suit,</td>
    <td class="tdr">2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the last or twelfth trick,</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The marriages count for the player holding and announcing
them; all other points for the player actually winning them. The
last trick does not count unless it is the twelfth; that is, not unless
every card is played.</p>

<p><i><b>Method of Playing.</b></i> The pone begins by leading any card
he pleases. The second player in any trick is not obliged to follow
suit, even in trumps; but may renounce or trump at pleasure until
the players cease to draw from the stock. If the second player
follows suit, the higher card wins the trick. Trumps win all other
suits.</p>

<p><i><b>Drawing.</b></i> The winner of the trick takes in the cards, turning
them face down; but before he leads for the next trick he draws
a card from the top of the stock, and places it in his hand without
showing or naming it. His adversary then draws the next card,
so that each restores the number of cards in his hand to six.</p>

<p><i><b>The Trump.</b></i> If either player holds or draws the Nine of
trumps, he may exchange it for the turn-up at any time, provided
he has already won a trick. This need not be the trick immediately
before exchanging, and he need not wait to get the lead before
making the exchange. For instance: A player holding the
Nine, and having to play to his adversary’s lead, may win the
trick with the turn-up card, leaving the Nine in its place, provided
he has won some previous trick. There is no count for dix, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
Bézique and Binocle, and the player is not obliged to exchange
unless he wishes to do so. If the Nine is the last card in the
stock, it is, of course, too late to exchange it, and the player drawing
it must keep it.</p>

<p><i><b>Marriages.</b></i> If a player holds both King and Queen of any
suit, he may count 20 points towards 66 for the marriage, or 40 for
royal marriage, by leading either of the marriage cards. It is not
necessary for the King or Queen so led to win the trick; but the
player declaring a marriage must have the lead, and must have
won a trick, or he cannot count it. The pone may declare a marriage
on his first lead; but it will not count unless he wins some
subsequent trick, and if his adversary gets to 66 before the pone
gets a trick, the marriage is lost, and the pone is schwartz.</p>

<p>If the 20 or 40 claimed for the marriage is enough to carry the
player’s count to 66 or beyond, the marriage need only be shown
and claimed, without leading it, and the remaining cards are then
abandoned, provided the count is correct. Only one marriage can
be shown but not led in this manner.</p>

<p>In the ordinary course of play it is not necessary to show both
cards of the marriage unless the adversary asks to see them.
The player simply leads the King or Queen, and says: “Twenty,”
or “Forty,” as the case may be. If he leads a King or Queen
without claiming any count, it is evident that he has not a marriage.
If he has simply forgotten to claim it, he cannot amend the error
after his adversary has played to the trick, and the score is lost.
To avoid disputes, careful players leave one of the marriage cards
face up among their cards, as a reminder that a marriage was
claimed in that suit, either by the player with the card turned, or
by his adversary.</p>

<p><i><b>Counting.</b></i> A player is not allowed to make any record of his
progress toward sixty-six, but must keep his count mentally. It is
highly important to keep both your own and your adversary’s
count, in order that you may always know how many each of you
wants to reach 66. A player is not allowed to go back over his
tricks to refresh his memory, and if he looks at any trick but the
last one turned and quitted, he loses the privilege of “closing.”</p>

<p>All <i><b>irregularities</b></i> in playing and drawing are governed by
the same rules as in Binocle.</p>

<p><i><b>The Last Six Tricks.</b></i> After the stock is exhausted, marriages
may still be led or shown, and scored; but the second
player in each trick must follow suit if he can, although he is not
obliged to win the trick unless he chooses to do so. If all the
cards are played, the winner of the last or twelfth trick, counts 10
for it toward his 66.</p>

<p><i><b>Announcing Sixty-six.</b></i> If neither of the players has
claimed to have reached 66 until after the last trick is played, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
turn over their cards and count their points. If only one has
reached 66, he counts one or two points, according to his adversary’s
count. If neither has reached 66, which is possible if no
marriages have been declared; or if both have 66 or more, and
neither has claimed it, neither side scores, but the winner on the
next deal adds one to whatever he may make. For instance: A
and B are adversaries, and the last trick is played without either
announcing that he is sixty-six. On counting, it is found that A
has 48 points and a marriage, 68 altogether, while B has 72 points
and the last trick, 82 altogether. Neither counts anything. On
the next deal let us suppose that A makes 66 before B gets out of
schneider, which will give A two points. To these he adds one
for the tie on the last deal, and scores three altogether.</p>

<p><i><b>Closing.</b></i> Closing is turning the trump card face down on the
remainder of the pack, which signifies that there shall be no more
drawing from the stock, and that the second player in each trick
must follow suit if he can, although he is not obliged to win the
trick.</p>

<p>A player can close only when he has the lead, but having the
lead, he may close at any time. The pone may close before leading
for the first trick; or after winning the first trick, and before
drawing from the stock. The leader may close after one or more
tricks have been played, and he may close without drawing from
the stock; or he may draw, and then close. If the leader closes
without drawing, his adversary must play without drawing.</p>

<p>When the stock is closed, the player holding the Nine of
trumps may still exchange it for the trump card, whether he is the
closer or not, provided he has previously won a trick. It is usual
for the closer, if he does not hold the Nine himself, to take up the
trump card and offer it to his adversary. This is an intimation
that he is about to turn it down if his adversary does not want it.
It is sometimes better not to exchange when the game is closed,
as it may give the adversary a good counting card if he can catch
all your trumps.</p>

<p>There is no score for the last trick when the game is closed, because
the number of tricks played will then be less than twelve.</p>

<p>As closing gives peculiar advantages to the closer, there are
certain forfeits if a person closes and fails to reach 66. There are
three varieties of closing, which are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>If, during the play of the hand, either player thinks he has
reached 66, he closes, and turns over the tricks he has already won.
If he is correct, he scores one, two, or three points, according to
the condition of his adversary’s count. But if he is not correct,
and has not quite reached 66, his adversary scores two points in
any case, and if the non-closer had not won a trick up to the time
the stock was closed, he scores three; because that is the number
the closer would have won if he had been correct in his count.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>If a player thinks he would have a better chance to reach 66
first if his adversary was compelled to follow suit, he may close
the stock. For instance: A’s mental count is 35, and he holds in
his hand a marriage, and the Ace of another plain suit; but no
trumps. If he closes at once, and leads the Ace, his adversary
will have to follow suit, and the 11 points will put the closing
player to 46. He can then show his marriage, without leading it,
and claim 66. But if the adversary should turn out to have none
of the suit led, and should trump the Ace, A might never reach 66,
and B would count two points.</p>

<p>A player may close, hoping to make schneider or schwartz. For
instance: A knows his score is 13, while B has 32. A has royal
marriage and Ace of trumps in his hand, and the Nine is turned
up. If A closes, and so compels B to follow suit, he must catch
the Jack or Ten of trumps by leading the Ace. If he catches the
Jack, that will put him to 26, and showing the royal marriage will
put him 66, and make B schneider. If B has no trump, one of
the marriage cards can be led without any fear of losing it, and
that will put A to 66, even if B plays a Nine to both leads. But if
A leads the ace of trumps without closing, B is not compelled to
follow suit, and might play the Nine of a plain suit to the Ace of
trumps. If A then closed or played on without closing, B might
win one of the marriage cards with the Ten, and not only get out
of schneider, but reach 66 in plain suits before A could win another
trick.</p>

<p>On the same principle, a player may think he can reach 66 before
his adversary can win a trick, provided he can compel him to follow
suit. With two plain-suit Aces and the royal marriage, the
pone would close before playing to the first trick, trusting to catch
at least 4 points with his two aces, and then to show the marriage,
making his adversary schwartz.</p>

<p>Some judgment is necessary in deciding whether or not to draw
before closing. If a player is allowed to draw, he may get a trump,
or a guard to one that you suspect he has. Suppose he has exchanged
the Nine for the Ten, and you have Ace and royal marriage;
it is very likely that the Ten is unguarded, and if you close
without drawing you may catch it, which will make your three
trumps alone good for 68. This also shows that the player should
not have taken up the Ten until he wanted to use it.</p>

<p>Nothing is gained by closing, except compelling the adversary
to follow suit; because if you close to make him schwartz, and he
gets a trick, you count two only; if you close to make him schneider,
and he gets out, you count one only. If you fail in the first
case, he counts three, and any failure will give him two points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<h3>THREE-HANDED SIXTY-SIX.</h3>

<p>This is exactly the same as the ordinary game, except that the
dealer takes no cards, but scores whatever points are won on the
hand he deals. If neither of the others score, either through each
making 65, or one failing to claim 66, the dealer scores one point,
and the others get nothing. The dealer cannot go out on his own
deal. He must stop at six, and win out by his own play.</p>

<p>There are two ways to settle: Each may pay a certain amount
to the pool, and the first man out take it all; or, after one is out, the
two remaining finish the game, and the loser pays both or settles
for the refreshments, as the case may be. If the first man goes
out when it will be his turn to deal, he must deal the next hand.</p>

<h3>FOUR-HANDED SIXTY-SIX</h3>

<p>This game is sometimes called <i><b>Kreutz-mariage</b></i>, owing to
the German fashion of dealing the cards in the form of a cross;
but as the cards are not dealt that way, and marriages are not
scored in America, the name is not appropriate in this country.</p>

<p>The pack is increased to thirty-two cards by the addition of the
Sevens and Eights. After the cards are cut by the pone, the dealer
gives three to each player on the first round, then two, and then
three again, turning up the last card for the trump. In Germany
the dealer first gives two cards to his partner, then two to his
left hand adversary, then two to his right hand adversary, and finally
two to himself. This is continued for four rounds, so that each
player receives eight cards, and the last is turned up for the trump.
The turned-up trump belongs to the dealer, and cannot be exchanged.</p>

<p>In this form of the game the players must not only follow suit,
but must win the trick if they can, and must trump and over-trump
if possible. A player is even obliged to win his partner’s
trick. Owing to this rule, a player with good plain suit cards will
usually attempt to exhaust the trumps as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>The <i><b>counting cards</b></i> are the same as in Sixty-six, and the
winner of the last trick counts 10. As there is no stock, there is
no closing; and as marriages are not counted in America, the 66
points must be made on cards alone.</p>

<p>The scores for <i><b>schneider</b></i> and <i><b>schwartz</b></i> are the same as in
Sixty-six, and seven points is game. There are 130 points made
in every deal, so if one side gets more than 66 and less than 100,
their adversaries must be out of schneider, and the winners count
one. More than 100, but less than 130 is schneider, and counts
two. If the winners take every trick, making 130 points, they
score three. Sometimes an extra point is scored for winning the
Ten of trumps: but such a count is quite foreign to the game.</p>

<h2 id="NATIONAL_GAMES">NATIONAL GAMES.</h2>

<p>There are certain games of cards which do not seem to belong
to any particular family, but stand apart from other games, and
have been played since their first invention with only trifling variations,
giving rise to no offshoots bearing other names. These are
usually the most popular games with the middle and lower classes
in the countries in which they are found, and may be considered as
distinctly national in character. Games that become popular with
the masses always last longer than others, and the rules governing
them are much better understood, and more firmly established. In
the course of a century the English aristocracy have run the gamut
of Quadrille, Ombre, Whist, Écarté, Bézique, Piquet, Rubicon, and
Bridge; while the middle classes have stuck steadily to Cribbage
for nearly two hundred years.</p>

<p>Six of these popular games are strikingly typical of the national
character, both in their construction, and in the manner of playing
them. These are: Skat in Germany; Cribbage in England;
Piquet in France; Conquian in Mexico; Calabrasella in Italy;
and Cassino in America. All these are excellent games, and have
deservedly survived much more pretentious rivals.</p>

<p>With the exception of Skat, little is known of the exact origin
of any of these games, although most of them may be traced
by their resemblance to more ancient forms. Skat is the most
modern, and to-day the most popular, many persons thinking it
superior to Whist. The game seems to have originated among
the farmers of Thuringia, a province of Saxony, and was probably
a variation of the Wendish game of Schapskopf. The first mention
of Skat that we can find is in an article in the “Osterländer
Blättern,” in 1818. Thirty years later Professor Hempel of Altenburg
published the rules and principles of the game under the title:
“Das Skatspiel, von J.F.L.H.” It is said that he learned the
game from a friend, who had been taught it by a Wendish coachman
in his employ. The game spread rapidly, and soon became
popular all over Germany, but with many minor variations in the
details of play. To settle these, a Skat congress was finally held
in Altenburg in 1886. This was succeeded by others in Leipzic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
and Dresden, and the result of these meetings has been to weed
out all the minor differences in play, and to settle upon a universal
code of laws for the game, which is called Reichs-Skat.</p>

<p>In America, Reichs-Skat is no longer played; the value of some
of the games is changed, and all the bidding is by Zahlen-reizen.
In all the text-books on Skat which we have examined, this fact
has been entirely overlooked.</p>

<h3>SKAT.</h3>

<p>The etymology of the word Skat, sometimes spelt Scat, is a
matter of doubt, but the most plausible explanation is that it is a
corruption of one of the terms in the parent game of Taroc;
“scart,” from “scarto,” what is left; or “scartare,” to discard or
reject. “Matadore” is another word from the game of Taroc,
still retained in Skat. Others attribute the word to “Skatt,” the
Old-German or Anglo-Saxon for money; the modern German,
“Schatz,” a treasure, referring to the forms of the game in which
good counting cards are laid aside in the skat for the count at the
end of the hand. This derivation would account for both spellings
of the word, with a “k” and with a “c.”</p>

<p>The student is advised to make himself familiar with the German
terms in the following description, as they are in common use
wherever skat is played. Many American players who use the
English language in bidding by figures, still adhere to the German
names for the suits and positions at the table.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Skat is played with a pack of thirty-two cards, all
below the Seven being deleted. The rank of the cards differs according
to whether the players are attempting to win or to lose
tricks. If the object is to win tricks, it is known as a “game;” if
the object is to lose, it is called a “nullo.” In nullo the cards rank
in their natural order; A K Q J 10 9 8 7, the Ace being the highest.
In the various “games,” the four Jacks are always the best trumps,
and are known as <i><b>Wenzels</b></i>. The other cards follow the usual
German rank; A 10 K Q 9 8 7, the Ace being the highest in plain
suits.</p>

<p>The German names for the cards are as follows;&mdash;<i><b>Jack</b></i>:
Wenzel, Bauern, Bube, Jungen, or Unter. <i><b>Ace</b></i>: As, or Daus.
<i><b>Ten</b></i>, Zehn. <i><b>King</b></i>, König. <i><b>Queen</b></i>: Dame, Ober, or Königen.
<i><b>Nine</b></i>, Neun. <i><b>Eight</b></i>, Acht. <i><b>Seven</b></i>, Sieben. The most common
terms are; Bube, As, Zehn, König, Dame, etc. The words
Unter and Ober for the Jack and Queen, refer to the manner of
marking the suits on the German cards. In the Queens, the mark
of the suit is always above the figure, which has a single head;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
in the Jacks the suit mark is always under the figure. This distinction
is necessary, because in the German cards the Queen is a
male figure. The King has two suit marks, one on each side of
the head. When the French or American double-head cards are
used, with suit-marks in both corners, the words “ober” and
“unter” have no meaning; Dame and Bube being used instead.</p>

<p><i><b>Rank of the Suits.</b></i> In addition to the rank of the cards
themselves, the suits outrank one another, except in Nullo, clubs
being always the best, then spades, hearts and diamonds. The
Germans have various names for the suits, that first given in each
instance being in common use among modern Germans. <i><b>Clubs</b></i>:
Kreuz, Trefle, Eicheln, Eckern, or Braün. <i><b>Spades</b></i>: Pique, Schüppen,
Laub, or Grün. <i><b>Hearts</b></i>: Hertzen, Cœur, or Roth. <i><b>Diamonds</b></i>:
Carreau, Schellen, Eckstein, Ruthen, or Gelb. In the
German notation of card games and problems, the suits are indicated
by the French terms: clubs, <i><b>tr</b></i> for trefle; spades, <i><b>p</b></i> for
pique; hearts, <i><b>co</b></i> for cœur; diamonds, <i><b>car</b></i> for carreau. The
cards are indicated by the initials; A K D B Z 9 8 7, which stand
for As, König, Dame, Bube, Zehn, etc. The winning card in each
trick is always printed in full-faced type.</p>

<p>The cards of each suit are divided into two parts, known as
counting cards, <i><b>Zahlkarten</b></i>, and those having no counting value;
<i><b>Fehlkarteten</b></i> or Ladons. The counting cards and their values
are as follows:&mdash;Ace 11, Ten 10, King 4, Queen 3, and Jack 2.
These are used in reckoning up the value of the tricks won by each
side in counting toward 61 in all the “games,” but not in Nullo.
The Seven, Eight and Nine have no counting value.</p>

<p>The rank of the suits has no influence on their trick-taking
powers, nor on the value of the Zahlkarten; but it increases or
diminishes the value of the “game” played for. When any suit
is made the trump, it takes the precedence of the three others
only in so far as trumps will win other suits, and the suits which
are not trumps are equal in value so far as trick-taking is concerned.
As the four Wenzels are always the highest trumps,
there will always be eleven cards in the trump suit, and seven in
each of the plain suits; so that if clubs were trumps, the rank of
the cards would be:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/p416.jpg" width="425" height="150" alt="🃛 🂫 🂻 🃋 🃑 🃚 🃞 🃝 | 🃙 🃘 🃗" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>In any of the other suits the rank would be:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p417a.jpg" width="400" height="75" alt="🂡 🂪 🂮 🂭 🂩 🂨 🂧" />
</div>

<p><i><b>Matadores.</b></i> The club Jack is always the best trump, and
every trump card in unbroken sequence with the club Jack is
called a Matadore, provided the sequence is in the hand of the
same player. This rule holds whether the sequence was in the
hand originally dealt to him or part of it is found in the Skat,
should he become possessed of the Skat cards. For instance:
Clubs are trumps, and a player holds these cards:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p417b.jpg" width="400" height="75" alt="🃛 🂻 🃋 🃑 🃚 🃘 🃗" />
</div>

<p>He has only one Matadore; but as the Skat cards will belong
to him if he has made the trump, he may find in them the spade
Jack, which would complete his sequence, giving him six Matadores,
instead of one. As one side or the other must have the
club Jack in every deal, there must always be a certain number of
Matadores, from one to eleven. If the player who makes the
trump has them, he is said to play <i><b>with</b></i> so many; if his adversaries
hold them, he is said to play <i><b>without</b></i> just as many as they
hold. The difficult thing for the beginner at Skat to understand
is that whether a player holds the Matadores or not, the number
of them has exactly the same influence on the value of his game.
If one player held these cards</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/p417c.jpg" width="280" height="75" alt="🃛 🂫 🂱 🂺 🂷" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">and wished to make hearts trumps, he would be playing “with
two.” If another player wished to make the same suit trumps
with these cards:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 330px;">
<img src="images/p417d.jpg" width="330" height="75" alt="🂻 🃋 🂾 🂽 🂹 🂸" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">he would be playing “without two,” and the value of each game
would be exactly the same, no matter which player actually made
the trump. Matadores must be held; they do not count if won
from the adversaries in the course of play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>MARKERS.</b></i> Counters of any kind are not used in Skat, as
the score is kept on a writing pad, which should be ruled into
vertical columns for the number of players engaged.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Skat is played by three persons. If there are
four at the table the dealer takes no cards, but shares the fortunes
of those who are opposed to the single player, winning and losing
on each hand whatever they win and lose. If there are five or six
at the table, the dealer gives cards to the two on his left, and the
one next him on the right. Those holding no cards share the fortunes
of the two who are opposed to the single player.</p>

<p>After the table is formed, no one can join the game without the
consent of all those already in, and then only after a <i><b>round</b></i>;
that is, after each player at the table has had an equal number of
deals. Should any player cut into a table during the progress of
a game, he must take his seat at the right of the player who dealt
the first hand. When six persons offer for play, it is much better
to form two tables, but some persons object to playing continuously,
and like the rest given to the dealer when more than three
play.</p>

<p>There are always three active players in Skat. The one who
makes the trump is called <i><b>the player</b></i>, or Spieler; the two opposed
to him are called the <i><b>adversaries</b></i>, or Gegners; while
those who hold no cards are called <i><b>im Skat</b></i>, or Theilnehmer.
Of the three active players, the one who leads for the first trick is
called <i><b>Vorhand</b></i>; the second player is called <i><b>Mittelhand</b></i>, and
the third <i><b>Hinterhand</b></i>. The person sitting on the dealer’s
right, to whom the cards are presented to be cut, is called the
<i><b>pone</b></i>.</p>

<p>No person is allowed to withdraw from the game without giving
notice in advance, and he can retire only at the end of a round
of deals. It is usual to give notice at the beginning of a round,
by saying: “This is my last.”</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> Positions at the table are drawn for, the cards
ranking as in play, Jacks being the best, and the suits outranking
one another in order, so that there can be no ties in cutting.
The lowest cut has the first choice of seats, and also deals the
first hand. It is usual for the player sitting on the right of the
first dealer to keep the score, so that one may always know when
a round ends.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> Skat is played for so much a point, and the single
player wins from or loses to each of the others at the table. A
cent a point is considered a pretty stiff game, half a cent being
more common in good clubs. Many play for a fifth, or even a
tenth of a cent a point. At half a cent a point, ten dollars will
usually cover a run of pretty bad luck in an evening’s play.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> At the beginning of the game the cards should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
be counted and thoroughly shuffled, and shuffled at least three
times before each deal thereafter. The dealer presents the pack
to the pone to be cut, and at least five cards must be left in each
packet. The cards are dealt from left to right in rotation, and the
deal passes to the left in regular order.</p>

<p>Only three persons at the table receive cards, no matter how
many are in the game. If there are four players, the dealer
gives himself no cards. If there are five or six players, the first
two on the dealer’s left and the pone receive cards. The other
persons at the table are said to be “im Skat,” because they are
laid aside for that deal.</p>

<p>The cards may be distributed in several ways, but whichever
manner the first dealer selects must be continued during the game,
both by the original dealer, and by the others at the table. Ten
cards are given to each player, and two are dealt face downward
in the centre of the table for the Skat. No trump is turned. The
cards must be dealt, three cards to each player, then two to the
Skat; then four to each player again, and finally three.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in the Deal.</b></i> If the pack is found to be imperfect,
the deal in which the error is discovered is void; but any
previous scores or cuts made with that pack stand good. If the
cards have not been cut, or if a card is found faced in the pack, or
if the dealer exposes a card in dealing, any active player who has
not looked at his cards may demand a fresh deal by the same
dealer. If the dealer gives too many or too few cards to any
player, he must shuffle and deal again. If the error is not discovered
until the hand is partly played out, the deal is void, and
the misdealer deals again. A misdeal does not lose the deal under
any circumstances, but it is usual to exact a penalty of ten points
for a misdeal.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> The object of each player
is to obtain the privilege of attempting to accomplish a certain
task, which is known as his “game,” and which he must be able
to carry through successfully against the combined efforts of the
two other players. The more difficult the task undertaken, the
greater the number of points scored for it, and the player who
will undertake the game which is of the greatest value of those
offered must be allowed the privilege of trying it. In order to
determine which player this is, they may all bid for the privilege by
naming a certain number of points, usually well within the actual
value of the game they intend to play. If a bidder meets with
opposition, he gradually approaches the true value of his game,
and the player whose game is worth the most will of course be
able to bid the greatest number of points, and must be selected as
the player, the two others being his adversaries.</p>

<p><i><b>Games.</b></i> These games are divided into two principal classes,
those in which the player undertakes to win, and those in which
he tries to lose. When he plays to lose, it is to lose every trick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
there being no trump suit, and the cards in each suit ranking A K
Q J 10 9 8 7. These games are called <i><b>Null</b></i>, or Nullo, and <i><b>Null
Ouvert</b></i>, the latter being played with the successful bidder’s cards
exposed face upward on the table, but not liable to be called. The
moment he wins a trick in a Nullo, he loses his game. Nullos
are quite foreign to Skat, and appear to have been introduced as a
consolation for players who always hold bad cards.</p>

<p>When <i><b>Ramsch</b></i> is played, the object is to take less than either
of the other players; but the cards rank as in the ordinary game,
except that the four Jacks are the only trumps.</p>

<p>In all other games the successful bidder undertakes to win; but
his success does not depend on the number of tricks he takes in,
but on the total value of the counting cards contained in those
tricks. The total value of all the counting cards is 120 points,
and to be successful, the single player must win at least 61. If he
succeeds in winning 61 or more points, he wins his game, whatever
it may be. If he can get 91 points, he wins a double game,
which is called <i><b>schneider</b></i>. If he can take every trick, he wins a
treble game, which is called <i><b>schwartz</b></i>. It is not enough to win
120 points, for if the adversaries win a single trick, even if it contains
no counting cards, they save the schwartz.</p>

<p>If the single player fails to reach 61, he loses. If he fails to
reach 31, he is schneider; and if he fails to take a trick he is
schwartz. These various results increase the value of the game,
as will presently be seen.</p>

<p>There are four varieties of games in which the successful bidder
plays to win, the difference being in the manner of using the skat
cards, and making the trump. These games are called <i><b>Frage</b></i>,
<i><b>Tourné</b></i>, <i><b>Solo</b></i>, and <i><b>Grand</b></i>, and they outrank one another in the
order given, Frage being the lowest. The first three: Frage,
Tourné and Solo, are each again divided into four parts, according
to the suit which is trumps; a Tourné in clubs being better than
one in spades; a Solo in hearts being better than one in diamonds,
and so on. This is in accordance with the rank of the suits already
mentioned in the paragraph devoted to that subject.</p>

<p>In a <i><b>Frage</b></i>, or Simple Game, the successful bidder takes both
the skat cards into his hand, and then declares which suit shall be
the trump; discarding two cards face downward for his schatz, or
treasure, before play begins. The two cards thus laid aside count
for the single player at the end of the hand, provided he takes a
trick, and they cannot be won by the adversaries unless they make
the single player schwarz. Frage is no longer played.</p>

<p>In a <i><b>Tourné</b></i>, the successful bidder turns one of the skat cards
face upward on the table before looking at the second card. He
may turn over whichever card he pleases, but the one he turns
fixes the trump suit for that hand. If the card turned over is a
Jack, he may change to a Grand; but he must do so before he sees
the second card in the Skat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>If the player does not like the first card he turns, he need not
show it, but may put it in his hand and turn the other. This second
one must be the trump; or a Grand may be played if the card
is a Jack. In case the game is lost after taking the second card, it
costs double. This is called <i><b>Passt mir Nicht</b></i>.</p>

<p>In a <i><b>Solo</b></i>, the skat cards are not touched, the successful bidder
naming the trump to suit the hand of ten cards originally dealt him.
The Skat belongs to him, as in Frage and Tourné, but he must not
see its contents until the hand is played out, when any points and
Matadores it may contain will count for him.</p>

<p>In a <i><b>Grand</b></i> there is no trump suit, the four Jacks being the
only trumps in play. These four cards preserve their relative suit
value, the club Jack being the best, and they are still Matadores.
There are four varieties of Grand: A tourné player may make
it a Grand if he turns up a Jack. This is called a <i><b>Grand
Tourné</b></i>. A player may make it a grand without seeing either
of the skat cards. This is called a <i><b>Grand Solo</b></i>. A player may
announce a Grand and lay his cards face up on the table; exposed,
but not liable to be called. This is called a <i><b>Grand Ouvert</b></i>. A
Frage cannot be played as a Grand under any circumstances. A
player may announce <i><b>Gucki Grand</b></i>, which means that he will
take both the skat cards into his hand at once, in order to get the
privilege of laying out any two cards he pleases, but that Jacks
will be the only trumps. If a Gucki Grand is lost, it costs
double.</p>

<p>A player may announce a <i><b>Gucki Nullo</b></i>, in which he takes
both the skat cards into his hand and lays out any two cards he
pleases. This loses double if it is not successful.</p>

<p><i><b>Revolution</b></i> is seldom played. It is a Nullo in which the adversaries
put their twenty cards together as one hand to see if they
can make the player take a trick.</p>

<p><i><b>Uno</b></i> and <i><b>Duo</b></i> are Grands, in which the single player engages
to take one trick in Uno, or two in Duo, neither more nor less.</p>

<p><i><b>GAME VALUES.</b></i> Each of the foregoing games has what
is called a unit of value, which is afterward multiplied several
times according to the number of Matadores, and whether the
game was schneider or schwarz.</p>

<p>These unit values are as follows, beginning with the lowest:</p>

<p>When one player takes no trick in a Ramsch, the player with the
greater number of points loses 30. If two players take no trick,
the loss is 50 points.</p>

<p><i><b>All Guckis lose double if they fail</b></i>, so that if a player
announces a Gucki Nullo and loses it, he will lose 30; but if he
won it he would get 15 only. If a player has a Gucki Null Ouvert,
he must announce that it is to be played open before he touches
the skat cards. It is then worth 30 if won; 60 if lost.</p>

<p><i><b>Passt-mir-nicht tournées all lose double if they fail</b></i>,
but win the usual number of points if they succeed.</p>

<p><i><b>Multipliers.</b></i> The foregoing are simply the standard counting
values of these various games. In calculating the actual value of
a player’s game, in order to see how much he may safely offer in the
bidding, and how much he would win if successful in his undertaking,
these standard values are multiplied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Five classes of games are recognized, beginning with the lowest,
in which the player gets the necessary 61 points, but does not make
his adversaries schneider. This is simply called “game,” and as
it must always be either won or lost, it is a constant factor. The
value of the game is 1, and each better game is numbered in regular
order, the five varieties being as follows:</p>

<p>The Game, 1. Schneider, 2. Schwarz announced or Schwarz, 3.
Schwarz after announcing Schneider, 4. Schwarz announced, 5.</p>

<p>These numbers are added to the number of Matadores, and the
total thus found is multiplied by the unit value of the game. For
instance: A player has obtained the privilege of playing on a bid
of thirty. His game is a Solo in hearts, in which he holds the three
highest Matadores and announces schneider in advance. His game
multiplier is therefore 3 (for the announced schneider), to which he
adds 3 more for the Matadores, 6 altogether. The unit value of a
heart Solo being 10, he could have gone on bidding to 60 had it
been necessary, and he will win 60 from each of his adversaries if
he succeeds in reaching 91 points in the counting cards he takes
in in his tricks, together with what he finds in the Skat.</p>

<p>If his adversaries got to 30 with their counting cards, he would
have lost 60 to each of them, although he bid only 30, because he
announced his game as schneider, and did not make it. Had he
not announced the schneider, and reached 91 or more in his counting
cards, he would have won a game worth 50, losing the extra
multiplier by not announcing the schneider in advance; for a
schneider made without announcing it is worth only 2.</p>

<p>In reckoning the value of a game it is always safer to bid on
playing “with” than “without” Matadores in a Solo or Tourné;
because, although you may have a hand “without four,” you may
find a Wenzel in the Skat, and if it is the club Jack you lose three
multipliers at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>BIDDING.</b></i> The players must be familiar with the manner
of computing the various games in order to bid with judgment,
and without hesitation. Suppose you hold the three highest
Matadores with an average hand, not strong enough in any one
suit to play a Solo, but good enough for a Tourné. Your smallest
possible game will be diamonds with three; which will be
worth 5 multiplied by 4; 1 for the game, and 3 for the Matadores,
20 points. If you can get the game on any bid less than 20
you are absolutely safe, provided you can reach 61 in your tricks.
But the opposition of another player may irritate you, [reizen,]
and provoke you to bid 24, or even 28, in the hope of turning
a heart or a spade. If you go beyond 20, and turn a diamond,
you must either find the fourth Matadore in the Skat, or make
your adversaries schneider, in order to secure another multiplier.
If you fail, you lose 24, or 28, according to your bid.</p>

<p>The great difficulty in Skat is to judge the value of a hand, so
as neither to under nor overbid it, and also to get all out of it that
it is worth. A person who plays a Frage in hearts when he
could easily have made it a Solo, reduces the value of his game
just eighty per cent. A player with the four Wenzels, A K Q 9 8
of diamonds, and a losing card, would be foolish to play a diamond
Solo with five, schneider announced, worth 72; while he had in
his hand a sure Grand, with four, schneider announced, worth 140.
Of course the schneider is not a certainty. The risk is that the
Ten of diamonds will be guarded, and that an Ace and a Ten
will make, both of them on your losing card, or one of them on the
diamond Ten. A careful player would be satisfied with 100 on
such a hand, for if he fails to make the announced schneider, he
loses everything.</p>

<p>A player is not obliged to play the game he originally intended
to, if he thinks he has anything better; but he must play a game
worth as much as he bid, or the next higher, and having once
announced his game, he must play it.</p>

<p>Suppose Vorhand has a spade Solo with two, and on being
offered 33 says, “Yes,” thinking the bidder will go on to 36, instead
of which he passes. It is very probable that the bidder has
a spade Solo without two, and will defeat a spade Solo announced
by Vorhand. If Vorhand has almost as good a game in hearts,
he should change, hoping to make schneider, or to find another
Matadore in the Skat. If he loses the game, a heart Solo with
two costs 30 points; but as Vorhand refused 33, and the next
best game he could have made with a heart Solo is 40, that is the
amount he loses, although he refused only 33.</p>

<p><i><b>Method of Bidding.</b></i> The Vorhand always holds the play,
and the Mittelhand always makes the first bid, or passes, the Hinterhand
saying nothing until the propositions made by the Mittelhand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
have been finally refused or passed by the Vorhand. The
usual formula is for the Vorhand to say, “How many?” or, “I
am Vorhand,” thereupon the Mittelhand bids or passes. If
Vorhand has as good a game as offered him he says, “Yes,” and
Mittelhand must bid higher or pass. If Vorhand has not as good a
game he may either pass, or bluff the bidder into going higher by
saying, “Yes.” As soon as one passes, the other turns to the
Hinterhand, who must either make a higher bid than the last, or
pass. The survivor of the first two must either say, “Yes,” to
the offers made by Hinterhand, or pass. The final survivor then
announces his game. It is usual for the last one to pass to signify
that he is done by pushing the skat cards toward the survivor,
indicating that they are his, and that he is the player. If a player
is offered a game equal to his own he may still say, “Yes;” but
if he is offered a better game, and still says, “Yes,” he runs the
risk of being compelled to play.</p>

<p>The old German way of bidding, adopted at the Skat Congresses
in Altenburg, Leipzig and Dresden, was to bid in suits; a
bid of club Solo outranking one of spade Solo, no matter what it
was worth. This has long been obsolete, the objection to it being
that a player might get the play on a game of much inferior value.
A player with a spade Solo, six Matadores, and schneider announced
could offer only a spade Solo, without mentioning its
value, and although his game was worth 99, he could be outbid
by an offer of Nullo, which was then worth only 20. This is contrary
to the spirit of the game, which requires that the person
offering the game of the greatest value shall be the player. The
rank of the bids in the old German game was as follows, beginning
with the lowest:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Frage, in the order of the suits.</li>
<li>Tourné, in the order of the suits.</li>
<li>Grand Tourné.</li>
<li>Solo in diamonds, hearts and spades.</li>
<li>Nullo, worth 20.</li>
<li>Solo in clubs.</li>
<li>Grand Solo, worth 16.</li>
<li>Null ouvert, worth 40.</li>
<li>Grand ouvert.</li>
</ul>

<p>The multipliers were the same as those used in the modern
game, but the player had no means of using them in his bids. It
will be observed that the modern value of the various games seeks
to preserve the old rank by assuming the lowest possible bid on
any given game.</p>

<p>In some parts of Germany it is still the custom to reckon Solos
at the tourné values, simply adding one multiplier for “out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
hand.” Thus a spade Solo with two would be reckoned; “with
two, one for game, one for out of hand; four times seven, or twenty-eight.”
Note that seven is tourné value for spades.</p>

<p><i><b>THE SKAT CARDS.</b></i> The successful bidder determined,
the skat cards are pushed towards him, and the manner in which
he uses them limits the game he is allowed to play. While the
player must win or lose a game worth as many as bid, he may
attempt to win as many more as he pleases. If he has got the
play on a bid of ten, that does not prevent him from playing a club
Solo, with schneider announced. But if he has bid or refused
eleven, and plays a tourné in diamonds, he must make schneider
or play with or without two Matadores in order to bring his multipliers
up to three. It both these fail him he loses 15, the next
higher game than his bid possible in a diamond tourné.</p>

<p>As Frage is no longer played on account of its small value, if
the player takes both the skat cards into his hand at the same time,
without showing them, his game must be a Gucki Grand, unless he
has previously announced that it is a Gucki Nullo. His game announced,
he lays out any two cards he pleases for his skat, so as to
play with ten only.</p>

<p>If the player turns over either of the skat cards, his game is
limited to a tourné. If he turns a Jack, he may change to Grand,
but not to Grand Ouvert. Neither schneider nor schwarz can be
announced in any game in which the skat cards are used. A
tourné player must lay out two skat cards to reduce his hand to
ten cards.</p>

<p>If the player neither turns over nor takes into his hand either
of the skat cards, he may play any of the suit Solos, Grand
Solo, Grand Ouvert, Nullo, or Null Ouvert. He may announce
schneider or schwarz in any Solo.</p>

<p>Any player looking at the skat cards before the beginning of the
play is debarred from bidding that deal, and is penalised ten
points in the score. In addition to this penalty, either of the other
players may demand a fresh deal. If a player looks at the skat
cards during the play of a hand the play is immediately stopped,
and if he is the single player he can count only the points taken in
up to that time, exclusive of the skat. These points are deducted
from 120, and his adversaries claim the difference. The game is
then settled, according to this count, exactly as if the hand had
been played out. If an adversary of the single player looks at
either of the skat cards during the play of a hand, the single
player may at once stop the game, and his adversaries can count
only the points they have taken in in tricks up to that time. If they
have no tricks they are schwartz; if they have not 30 points they
are schneider.</p>

<p>When four or more play, any person holding no cards may be
penalised ten points for looking at the skat cards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The successful bidder having
disposed of the skat cards and announced his game, the Vorhand
leads any card he pleases for the first trick. Vorhand should
be careful not to lead until the player has laid out or discarded for
the Skat in a Gucki or a Tourné. Players must follow suit if they
can, but are not obliged to win the trick. Having none of the suit
led, they may trump or discard at pleasure. The highest card
played, if of the suit led, wins the trick, and trumps win all other
suits. The winner of the first trick leads for the next, and so on,
until all the cards have been played, or the game is acknowledged
as won or lost, and abandoned. In a Grand, if a Jack is led,
players must follow suit with the other Jacks, they being trumps.</p>

<p><i><b>Abandoned Hands.</b></i> If the single player finds he has overbid
himself, or sees that he cannot make as good a game as bid, he
may abandon his hand to save himself from being made schneider
or schwarz, provided he does so before he plays to the second
trick. A Solo cannot be abandoned in this manner, as the rule is
made only to allow a player to get off cheaply who has been unlucky
in finding nothing in the Skat to suit his hand. For instance:
A player has risked a Tourné with a missing suit, and turns up that
suit. He can abandon his hand at once, losing his bid or the next
higher game, but escaping schneider.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in the Hands.</b></i> If, during the play of a
hand, any person is found to have too many or too few cards, the
others having their right number, it is evident that there has been
no misdeal if the pack is perfect and there are two cards in the
Skat. If the player in error has too few cards, probably from having
dropped one on the floor, or having played two cards to the
same trick, he loses in any case, but the adversary may demand to
have the hand played out in order to try for schneider or schwarz,
and the last trick, with the missing card, must be considered as
having been won by the side not in fault. If the player in fault is
opposed to the single player, his partner suffers with him. If the
player discovers his loss, he is not allowed to pick the card from
the floor and replace it in his hand if he has in the meantime played
to a trick with a wrong number of cards.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing Out of Turn.</b></i> The usual penalty in America for
leading or playing out of turn is the loss of the game if the error is
made by the adversaries of the single player. If by the player himself,
the card played in error must be taken back, and if only one
adversary has played to the false lead, he may also take back his
card. If both have played, the trick stands good. The single
player suffers no penalty, as it is only to his own disadvantage to
expose his hand.</p>

<p><i><b>The Revoke.</b></i> If a player revokes, and he is one of the adversaries
of the single player, the game is lost for the player in error;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
but he may count the points in his tricks up to the time the revoke
occurred, in order to save schneider or schwarz. In Nullos, the
game is lost the moment the revoke is discovered.</p>

<p><i><b>Seeing Tricks.</b></i> The tricks must be kept separate as they are
taken in, and any player is allowed to look at the last trick turned
and quitted. Any player looking at any other trick but the last
may be penalized ten points.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing Ouverts.</b></i> The rules of the game require Ouverts to
be exposed face upward on the table before a card is played.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> The score should always be kept by the player
sitting on the right of the first dealer. This will mark the rounds.
The score sheet should be ruled in vertical columns, one for each
player at the table.</p>

<p>Each player is charged individually with his losses and gains,
the amounts being added to or deducted from his score, and a plus
or a minus mark placed in front of the last figure, so that the exact
state of each player’s score will be apparent at a glance.</p>

<p>The score of the single player is the only one put down, and it
is charged to him as a loss or a gain at the end of each deal.</p>

<p>If there are four players, a line is drawn under every fourth
amount entered in each person’s account. If three play, the line
is drawn under every third amount. This system of scoring will
show at once whose turn it is to deal, if the total number of
amounts under which no line is drawn are counted up. For instance:
Three persons play; A dealt the first hand. In the first
three columns are shown the amounts won and lost in the three
rounds, while the last three columns show the manner in which
these losses and gains were entered on the score sheet:&mdash;</p>

A and C, and find that A owes C

which is 69 points; put down plus
for B, minus for C. Then we add
up to see that the scores balance.</p>

<p>If B is zero, his points are to be taken from those of each of the
others, as B is plus. If the low score is a minus, the points must
be added to each of the others. The three totals are added, and
found, in this case, to be 520, which is the total of B’s loss. We
now multiply the scores by the number of players engaged, in this
case four, and from the product we deduct the 520 already found.
Then the scores balance.</p>

<p>When Skat is played for the League stake, which is one-fourth
of a cent a point, the results may be found in a still shorter way by
adding up all the scores and taking an average, this average being
the sum divided by the number of players. Take the results just
given for example:&mdash;</p>

<p>The average is simply deducted from each score, and the remainder
is the amount won or lost, in cents.</p>

<p><i><b>CHEATING.</b></i> As in all games in which the cards are dealt
in groups, the greek will find many opportunities in Skat. The
clumsiest shuffler can usually locate some of the Wenzels at the
top or the bottom of the pack, before presenting it to be cut, and
if the players do not insist on the cards being dealt always in the
same manner, the sharper can secure to himself two or more Wenzels,
either in his hand or in the Skat. Any person who deals the
cards sometimes three at a time, and again five at a time, should
be stopped immediately, and no such excuses as changing his luck
should be listened to for a moment. Any person who habitually
picks up the cards with their faces towards him, and straightens
them by lifting them from their positions in the pack, should be
stopped at once, and requested to straighten the cards face down.</p>

<p>Dealing seconds is very difficult when the cards have to be
“pinched” in threes and fours. A second dealer holding back a
Wenzel on the top may give his adversary two underneath without
knowing it. Marked cards are of advantage only when the dealer
plays, and are of little use beyond telling him what he can turn up
for a trump, or what he will find in the Skat. The rule for having
four in the game, if possible, is one of the greatest safeguards, unless
the dealer is in secret partnership with one of the players.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> The chief
things to master in Skat are the values of the hands, the principles
of bidding on them, the best methods of playing them, and the
proper methods of combining forces with your partner for the time
being, in order to defeat the single player.</p>

<p><i><b>Bidding.</b></i> Some persons attach a great deal of importance to
the odds for and against certain cards being in the Skat. If a
player without three is forced to risk finding a Matadore in the
Skat, it is usually enough for him to know that the odds are about
3 to 1 against it. It is much more important for him to consider
what cards may make against him, and what they would count.
It is often necessary to estimate very closely the number of points
that must fall on a certain number of leads. For instance: You
are Vorhand, and hold these cards:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p429.jpg" width="500" height="75" alt="🂫 🂻 🃋 🃞 🃝 🃙 🃘 🃗 🃇 🂧" />
</div>

<p>Even if you find the Ace and Ten with the best Wenzel in one
hand against you, you have an almost certain club Solo, for if you
lead a Wenzel, your adversary must either take it, or give you the
Ace or Ten. If he wins it, and his partner gives him a Ten of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
another suit, and they then proceed to make both the Aces and
Tens of your weak suits, that will give them only 56 points, and
you will make every other trick. The only thing that could defeat
you is for one player on the fourth trick to lead a suit of which his
partner had none. This would require one player to have all the
spades and the other all the hearts, which is almost impossible.</p>

<p>Another familiar example is the following: You are Vorhand
with these cards:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p430.jpg" width="500" height="75" alt="🃛 🂫 🃑 🃚 🂡 🂪 🂸 🂷 🃈 🃇" />
</div>

<p>Although you cannot possibly win more than six tricks, and
must lose every trick in the red suits, you have an invincible
Grand; because the adversaries have not a sufficient number of
Fehlkarten to give you to avoid adding 16 points to the 46 you already
have in your hand, which must make you 62 before they get
a trick.</p>

<p>It is better to bid on a doubtful Solo than on a risky Tourné,
and if you have a choice of two numerically equal suits, it is better
to bid on a suit containing small cards in preference to one containing
A 10. In bidding Tournés, you must remember that the
more cards you hold of a suit, the less your chance to turn up one.</p>

<p>It is not good play to bid a Solo on four or five trumps unless
you have some aces in the other suits. A Grand may be bid even
without a trump, if you have the lead, and hold four aces, or three
aces and four Tens. A Grand with any two Wenzels is safe if
you have two good suits. A Nullo should never be bid unless the
player has the Seven of his long suit.</p>

<p>A certain amount of risk must be taken in all bids, and a player
who never offers a game that is not perfectly safe is called a
<i><b>Maurer</b></i>; one who builds on a solid foundation. The player
who offers the most games will usually win the most unless he is a
very poor player.</p>

<p><i><b>Leading.</b></i> The single player should almost always begin with
the trumps, in order to get them out of his way. With a
sequence of Wenzels, it is a common artifice to begin with the
lowest, hoping the second player may fatten the trick by discarding
a Ten or Ace, under the impression that the Hinterhand can
win it. This style of underplay is called <i><b>Wimmelfinte</b></i>, and the
Mittelhand should beware of it. With only one Wenzel and the
Ace and Ten, it is better to begin with a small trump. If you find
all the trumps in one hand against you, or tenace over you, stop
leading trumps, and play forcing cards.</p>

<p>If you have no Wenzels it is usually best to lead your smallest
trumps. If you have only Ace Ten and small trumps, and know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
the adversaries have one Wenzel and one trump better than your
small one, lead your Ten, so that they cannot make both trumps.
In playing for a schneider, it is often advisable to continue the
trumps, even after the adversaries are exhausted, so that they shall
not know which suit to keep for the last trick.</p>

<p><i><b>Laying out the Skat.</b></i> In a Frage or a Tourné, some judgment
is required in discarding for the Skat. It is often necessary
to lay aside the Ace and Ten of trumps if there is any danger that
the adversaries may catch them. Unguarded Tens should always
be laid out, and it is a good general principle to get rid of one
suit entirely, so that you can trump it. It is a common practice
to put in the Skat the Ace and Ten of a suit of which you hold
also the King. When you lead the King, if Mittelhand has none
of the suit he is sure to fatten the trick for his partner, thinking
he must have Ace or Ten. With the Ten, King, and small cards
of a plain suit, lay the Ten and King in the Skat.</p>

<p><i><b>The Adversaries</b></i> should combine against the single player by
getting him between them if possible. If you sit on the left of the
player, lead your short suits up to him; but if you sit on his right,
lead your longest suit through him. Try to force out his trumps
on your plain-suit cards if you can, and avoid giving him discards
of his weak suits. With a long trump suit, it is often advantageous
to lead it through the player, but seldom right to lead it up to
him.</p>

<p>In Solos, the adversaries should lead Aces and winning cards,
and change suits frequently. If you are playing against a Grand,
and have two trumps, one of them the best, lead it, and then play
your long suit; but if you have the two smallest trumps, lead the
long suit first, and force with it every time you get in.</p>

<p>The partners should always scheme to protect each other’s Tens
by keeping the Aces of plain suits. For this reason it is very
bad play to fatten with the Ace of a suit of which you have
not the Ten, or to play an Ace third hand when there are only
small cards in the trick, and the Ten of the suit has not been played
and you do not hold it.</p>

<p>If the player is void of a suit, continue leading it, no matter
what you hold in it. This will either weaken his trumps, or, if he
is between you, will give your partner discards.</p>

<p>If the player leads a Wenzel, it is usually best to cover it if you
can; but do not play the club Jack on the diamond Jack unless
you want the lead very badly.</p>

<p>When the single player does not lead trumps, but plays his Aces
and Tens, the Germans call it “auf die Dörfer gehen;” that is,
getting to the villages, or getting home; equivalent to our expression,
“getting out of the woods,” or “getting in out of the rain.”
When the single player runs for home in this way, it is usually
best to lead trumps through him at the first opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>In playing against a Nullo, the great point is to give your partner
discards. If you find that the player’s long suit is yours also,
continue it until your partner has discarded an entire suit if possible.
If you then have the small card of the discarded suit, you
may defeat the Nullo at once.</p>

<p><i><b>Fattening.</b></i> The Germans call this Wimmeln, or “swarming”
the points together in one trick. It is always advisable to
get rid of Tens in this way, or Aces of suits in which you hold
both Ace and Ten; but it is bad play to fatten with the Ace of a
suit of which you have not the Ten, unless the trick wins the game
from the player, or saves a very probable schneider.</p>

<p>The following <i><b>Illustrative Hands</b></i> will give the student a
very good idea of the manner in which the various forms of the
game are played, showing the difference in the play of a Tourné,
Solo, and Grand.</p>

<p><i><b>A TOURNÉ.</b></i> A, Vorhand, has refused ten with the following
cards, Hinterhand having passed without a bid:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p>A concludes to play a Tourné, and turns the heart ♡ Q, finding
the ♢ King in the Skat. He lays out the ♠ 10 and ♠ 9 in the
Skat, and expects to make 12 points; a heart Tourné, with one
Matadore. The play is given in the margin. A is the player,
and is also Vorhand, with the lead for the first trick. Hearts are
trumps.</p>

trick, and of course begins
with the trumps. The play is
given in the margin.</p>

<p>C wins the first trick, and
leads his long suit through the
player. In the last three tricks
A coaxes B to win the Ten of
trumps; but if B does so he
gives up the advantage of his
tenace over the player, which
is now the only chance to
defeat him. B knows that if
he wins the Ten of trumps,
B and C can make only 59
points, because A will save
his trump Ace.</p>

<p>A, having failed to reach 61,
loses a spade Solo without
one; twice 11, or 22 points,
which was the game he must
have won to be as good as the offer of 18 which he refused.</p>

<p><i><b>A GRAND.</b></i> B bids; both Vorhand and Hinterhand pass,

</div>

<p>The play is given in the margin. In a Grand the four Jacks are
the only trumps.</p>

<p>A has the first play, and as he leads through the player, he begins
with his long suit, of which he knows that the Ace alone is out,
and it may be in the skat. If the player has the Ace, C will probably
trump it. If the player has not the Ace, it is just possible
that he will not trump the Ten.</p>

<p>C, leading up to the player, opens his short weak suit.
At trick 3, C knows that A must have the Ten of hearts,
or he would not fatten with the Ace. As this shows that A
can stop the heart suit, C guards the spades and lets all his
hearts go.</p>

<p>B loses a very strong Grand, which must have been successful if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
C had had one club, or if A had led anything but the club Ten.
A Grand with three Matadores is worth 4 times 20 or 80 points,
which is what B loses, although
he may have bid only 10 or 12
to get the play.</p>

<p>All but the first two on the
list treat of the old game, bidding
by suits, and making no
mention of Guckis; but some
of them, especially Buhle’s, contain some very fine examples of
good play. The first two on the list and the last two are in
English. All the others are in German.</p>

<h3>AMERICAN SKAT.</h3>

<p>In this variation, now so largely played, the highest bidder
always sees the skat before announcing his game. Although
a gucki, it need not be a grand, but may be solo or nullo if he
likes. If he wins the game he announces the scores as usual;
but if he loses he always loses double. He may announce
schneider or schwarz after discarding for the skat. If he makes
an announced schneider, it doubles the value of his game, instead
of simply adding a multiplier. An announced schwarz
trebles it.</p>

<p>For example: Spade solo with 1, schneider announced. His
game is 1 for game, 1 for schneider, without 1, 3 × 11 = 33,
doubled for announcing schneider, 66. If lost, it costs 132. If
he makes schwarz after announcing schneider, it adds one multiplier,
77. The smallest possible game is a diamond with or
without 1, worth 18; 36 if lost. The largest game possible to
lose is a grand with four, schwarz announced, costing 1,008.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE LAWS OF SKAT.</h3>

<h4>THE GAMES.</h4>

<p>1. The following are the unit values of the various games:&mdash;</p>

<p>Frage shall not be allowed. Tournée in diamonds 5, in hearts
6, in spades 7 and in clubs 8. Solo in diamonds 9, in hearts 10,
in spades 11 and in clubs 12, Turned grand 12, gucki grand 16,
solo grand 20 and open grand 24. Gucki nullo 15, open gucki
nullo 30, solo nullo 20, open solo nullo 40, and revolution, if played,
60. Uno and duo, if played, shall be worth 20, or if played
open 40.</p>

<p>2. When there are trumps, the unit value of the game shall be
multiplied as follows: 1 for game; 2 for schneider; 3 for announcing
schneider, or for making schwarz without having made any
announcement; 4 for schwarz after having announced schneider;
and 5 for announcing schwarz. To each of these multipliers shall
be added one for each matadore, “with” or “without.”</p>

<p>3. In tournées, if the player says “passt-mir-nicht” to the first
card and takes the second, he loses double if he loses his game.
In guckis, whether grand or nullo, the player loses double if he
loses his game.</p>

<p>4. The value of Ramsch shall be 20 points, to be charged to the
player losing the game. If one player takes no trick, the loser shall
be charged 30 points. If two players take no trick, the loser shall
be charged 50 points. The winner of the last trick takes the skat
cards. If there is a tie between two for high score, the winner of
the last trick shall be the loser. If the last trick is taken by the
low score, and the others are tied, the two high scores lose 20 points
each. If all three are tied at 40 points each, there is no score.</p>

<p>5. In all games which are played “open,” the hand of the single
player must be laid face up on the table before either adversary
plays a card; but the adversaries shall not be allowed to consult,
neither can they dictate to the player what cards he shall play.</p>

<h4>FORMATION OF TABLE.</h4>

<p>6. Any number from three to six may form a table, but there
shall be only three active players in each deal, and they shall be
known respectively as Vorhand, Mittelhand, and Hinterhand.
Those who hold no cards shall share the fortunes of those opposed
to the single player whose score is put down.</p>

<p>7. There shall be as many deals in each round as there are
players at the table, and no person shall be allowed to withdraw
from the game during a round unless the others consent to a substitute
and such substitute be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span></p>

<p>8. Newcomers can enter the table only after the conclusion of a
round and with the consent of the other players. The new candidate
for play must take his seat so that he shall have the deal.</p>

<p>9. If seats are drawn for, the lowest skat card shall have the
first choice. The next lowest shall sit on his left, and so on. In
cutting, the cards and suits rank as in play. The one drawing the
lowest card shall deal the first hand, and the score shall be kept by
the player on his right.</p>

<p>10. The game shall come to an end only at the conclusion of a
round, and any player wishing to stop must give notice before the
beginning of a round.</p>

<h4>CARDS.</h4>

<p>11. There are thirty-two cards in the pack, the rank and value
of which are as follows: Jack 2; ace 11; ten 10; king 4; queen
3; the nine, eight and seven having no counting value.</p>

<p>12. The suits shall always outrank one another in the same
order; clubs, spades, hearts and diamonds. The four jacks, or
Wenzels, which are always the four best trumps, shall outrank one
another in the same order.</p>

<p>13. In Nullo, the cards rank: A K Q J 10 9 8 7, and the suits
and jacks are all of equal rank.</p>

<h4>DEALING.</h4>

<p>14. When four or more play at the same table, the dealer takes
no cards, but gives cards to the two sitting immediately on his left
and to the one next him on his right.</p>

<p>15. When only three play, Hinterhand shall deal the cards.</p>

<p>16. The deal passes in regular order to the left.</p>

<p>17. After being thoroughly shuffled, the pack must be presented
to the pone (the player sitting on the dealer’s right) to be cut, and
at least three cards must be left in each packet. Any player may
demand a right to shuffle the cards before they are dealt, but the
dealer shall have the last shuffle before presenting the cards to be
cut. If any card is exposed in cutting, there must be a new cut.</p>

<p>18. The dealer shall give each active player cards, three at a
time for the first round, face down, beginning on his left. He shall
then lay aside, face down, two cards for the skat. Each player
shall then receive four cards at a time for the second round, and
finally three cards at a time for the last round.</p>

<p>19. If any card is found faced in the pack, or if the pack be
proved incorrect or imperfect, there must be a new deal. An imperfect
pack is one in which there are duplicate or missing cards,
or cards so torn or marked that they can be identified by the
backs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>20. Should a player deal out of his turn, the deal must stand
if it is complete; otherwise there must be a new deal by the right
dealer. When the deal stands, the next deal must be by the player
who should have dealt, and subsequent deals must be so arranged
that there shall be the right number to each round. A player
dealing out of turn may be penalized 10 points.</p>

<h4>ERRORS IN DEALING.</h4>

<p>21. There are no misdeals. No matter what happens, the same
dealer must deal again if it was his proper turn to deal.</p>

<p>22. If a card is exposed by the dealer during the deal, there
must be a new deal; or if the cards of the players become confused,
so that the dealer cannot separate them.</p>

<p>23. If the dealer gives too many or too few cards to any player,
or neglects to lay out the skat cards in their proper turn, or does
not give the right number of cards in each round, or gives three to
one player and four to another, or fails to present the pack to be
cut, there must be a new deal, and the dealer is charged 10 points
for the error.</p>

<h4>THE SKAT CARDS.</h4>

<p>24. Any active player taking up or seeing either or both the skat
cards when he is not entitled to do so shall be debarred from
bidding that deal. If any but an active player look at either of the
skat cards, 10 points shall be deducted from his score.</p>

<p>25. If any Kiebitz (an onlooker not belonging to the table) looks
at either of the skat cards, he may be called upon to pay the value
of the game.</p>

<p>26. If an active player look at the skat cards during the play,
he not having laid out those cards from his own hand, his game is
lost if he is the single player. If he is opposed to the player, the
player’s game is won, but it may be played out to see if he can
make schneider or schwarz.</p>

<p>27. Should an active player take one or both the skat cards into
his hand by mistake, before the bidding begins, the dealer shall
draw from his hand, face down, enough cards to reduce his hand
to ten, and the player in fault shall be charged 25 points penalty,
and be debarred from bidding for that deal. If, in three-hand, the
player in fault is the dealer, Vorhand shall draw.</p>

<p>28. Should the successful bidder take both the skat cards into
his hand together, or pick them up together, he shall be obliged
to play a Gucki Grand, unless he has announced to play Nullo.
Should he put the first card into his hand without showing it, he
shall be obliged to turn up the second card and play Passt-mir-nicht.</p>

<p>29. The player may turn up either of the skat cards; but should
he expose both he must play the suit of higher value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>30. Should he turn a jack, he may either play in suit or announce
a turned Grand.</p>

<p>31. A player turning up a seven cannot announce a Nullo unless
it has been previously agreed to play turned Nullos, which are
worth 10 points.</p>

<p>32. The player who takes the skat cards must lay out two cards
in their place before a card is led. Should he neglect to lay out
for the skat before he plays to the first trick; or should he lay out
more or less than two cards, and not discover the error until the
first trick has been turned and quitted, he shall lose his game.</p>

<h4>BIDDING.</h4>

<p>33. All bidding shall be by numbers representing the value of
some possible game, and the lowest bid allowed shall be 10.</p>

<p>34. Mittelhand must bid to Vorhand, and Vorhand must either
undertake as good a game as that offered him, or pass. If Vorhand
passes, Hinterhand bids to Mittelhand, and Mittelhand must either
undertake as good a game as that offered, or pass. If Mittelhand
passes, when bidding to Vorhand, Hinterhand must bid to Vorhand:
but Hinterhand is not allowed to say anything until either Mittelhand
or Vorhand has passed.</p>

<p>35. Any figure once named cannot be recalled. A player having
once passed, cannot come into the bidding again.</p>

<p>36. The survivor of the bidding shall be known as the Player,
and shall have the privilege of naming the game to be played; the
two other active players being his adversaries.</p>

<p>37. If no bid is made, and Vorhand will not undertake to play
any game against the two others, they must play Ramsch.</p>

<h4>ANNOUNCEMENTS.</h4>

<p>38. The player, if he does not use the skat cards, may announce
any suit for the trump, or he may play a Grand or Nullo.</p>

<p>39. If he wishes to announce schneider or schwarz, he must do
so when he names the game to be played, and before a card is led.
All Open Grands are compulsory “schwarz announced.”</p>

<p>40. The manner of taking up the skat cards, when the player
uses them, is sufficient announcement for a Tournée, Passt-mir-nicht,
or Guckser; but a Gucki Nullo must be announced before the skat
cards are touched, and open Gucki Nullo must be announced before
the skat cards are seen.</p>

<p>41. The player is not allowed to announce either schneider or
schwarz in any game in which he uses the skat cards.</p>

<p>42. The adversaries cannot announce schneider or schwarz
under any circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>43. No player but Vorhand can announce Ramsch, and then only
when no bid has been made.</p>

<h4>PLAYING.</h4>

<p>44. In Tournée, but not in Solo, Grand, or Nullo, the player may,
in order to avoid the possibility of being made schneider, abandon
his game as lost before playing to the second trick. The adversaries
are then bound to score it as a “game” lost, even if they could
have made the player schneider.</p>

<p>45. No matter who is the single player, Vorhand shall always
lead for the first trick. The winner of one trick leads for the next,
and so on, and each player in turn must follow suit if he can.</p>

<p>46. If, during the play of the hand, any player is found to have
a wrong number of cards, the others having their right number,
only those who have their right number can win the game. If it
is the player who has a wrong number, his game is lost. If it is
one of his adversaries, the player’s game is won.</p>

<p>47. If the single player leads out of turn, the cards must be
taken back if the trick is not complete and the adversary who has
not played demands it. If both adversaries have played to the
false lead, the trick stands. If an adversary has played to his false
lead, the player cannot take it back unless the other adversary
permit it.</p>

<p>48. If an adversary of the player leads out of turn, and the
player calls attention to it, the player may immediately claim his
game as won and abandon the hand; or he may insist that the play
proceed with a view to making the adversaries schneider or
schwarz. Whether he proceeds or not his game is won, and he
may either let the false lead stand, or insist on a lead from the
proper hand.</p>

<p>49. If, during the progress of the hand, the player lays his cards
on the table, face up, and announces that he has won his game by
reaching 61 or 91, whichever may be necessary to make good his
bid, and it is proved that he is mistaken, he loses his game, even if
he could have taken up his cards again and won it.</p>

<p>50. If an adversary lays his cards on the table, face up, and
claims to have already defeated the player’s game, all that adversary’s
cards shall be taken by the player and counted with the tricks
already taken in by the player. If the adversary be found to be in
error, the player shall score his game as won, even if he would have
lost it had it been continued.</p>

<p>51. If the single player gives up his game as lost, and lays his
cards on the table, the adversaries shall take all such cards and
add them to their own, and count their cards to see if they have
also made the player schneider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE REVOKE.</h4>

<p>52. Should the single player revoke, and not discover the error
before the trick is turned and quitted, he loses his game. If he
discovers the error and corrects it in time, there is no penalty; but
any adversary who plays after him may amend his play.</p>

<p>53. If either adversary of the player revokes, the player may
claim his game as won; but he may insist on playing the hand out
to see if he can make schneider or schwarz. Even if the single
player has overbid his hand, he wins his game if either adversary
revokes.</p>

<h4>LOOKING BACK.</h4>

<p>54. Any active player may see the last trick turned and quitted,
provided no card has been led for the next trick. Should a player
look back at any other trick, or count his cards, he loses the game;
but either of the others may insist on playing on to see if they can
make schneider.</p>

<p>55. If an adversary of the player tell his partner how many points
they have taken in, or ask him to fatten a trick which is his, or call
attention in any way to the fact that the partner’s play should be
thus or so, the single player may at once claim his game as won,
and abandon his hand.</p>

<h4>SCORING.</h4>

<p>56. The single player wins his game if he reaches 61 points.
He wins schneider if he makes 91. He wins schwarz if he gets
every trick.</p>

<p>57. If the adversaries reach 30, they are out of schneider. If
they reach 60, they defeat the player. If they get to 90, they
make him schneider; and if they win every trick they make him
schwarz.</p>

<p>58. The value of the game having been calculated according to
Law No. 2, the amount won or lost shall be entered on the score
pad under the name of the individual player, and each following
item shall be added to or deducted from the previous total, so that
the last entry shall at all times show the exact state of the player’s
score.</p>

<p>59. At the end of the sitting each player wins from or loses to
each of the others at the table the full amount of his score.</p>

<p>60. In every case in which a player loses his game, he loses what
he would have won if he had been successful, regardless of the
amount he may have bid; but,</p>

<p>61. If the player fails to win a game equal to the amount he has
bid, he loses the value of the next higher game which would have
made his bid good; because in no case can a player lose less than
he bid, and in every case must he lose some multiple of the game
which he declared to play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<h3>FROG.</h3>

<p>This is a very popular game in Mexico, and seems to be an elementary
form of Skat, which it resembles in many ways. Even the
name may be a corruption of the simple game in Skat, which is
called “frage.” The chief differences are that there are four cards
added to the pack for frog, and that the players win or lose according
to the number of points they get above or below 61, instead of
computing the value of the game by matadores.</p>

<p><i><b>Players.</b></i> Three, four, or five can play; but only three are active
in each deal. If four play, the dealer takes no cards. If five
play, he gives cards to the two on his left and one on his right.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards.</b></i> There are thirty-six cards in the pack, which rank:
A 10 K Q J 9 8 7 6. Each Ace is worth 11, Tens are worth 10,
Kings 4, Queens 3, and Jacks 2. This gives us 120 points in the
pack, and the object is to get 61 or more.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> Any one can deal the first hand, after which the deal
passes to the left. Three cards are given to each player the first
round, then three for the widow, and then two rounds of four cards
each to the players, so that there are three hands of eleven cards
each, and three in the widow.</p>

<p><i><b>THE GAMES.</b></i> Each player in turn, beginning on the dealer’s
left, can offer to play one of three games, and the highest offer must
be accepted. A player cannot increase his own bid unless he is
overbid. The highest bidder becomes the single player, opposed
to the two others.</p>

<p><i><b>Frog.</b></i> In this, hearts must be trumps. The single player turns
the widow face up to show what it contained, and then takes the
three cards into his hand. He must then discard to reduce his
playing hand to eleven cards again. Any points in the cards he
lays away will count for him at the end of the play.</p>

<p>The player on the dealer’s left always leads for the first trick, any
card he pleases. The others must follow suit if they can, but they
are not obliged to head the trick. If a player cannot follow suit,
he must trump, and if the third player cannot follow suit either, he
must play a trump, but he is not obliged to over-trump unless he
likes.</p>

<p>The eleven tricks played, each side turns over the cards taken in
and counts the points. For every point the single player gets over
60 he must be paid a counter by each of the others who held cards.
But if he does not get 60, he must pay each of the others at the
table, including those who held no cards, if any, a counter for every
point his adversaries get over 60.</p>

<p><i><b>Chico</b></i> outbids Frog. The player offering this game can name
any suit for the trump except hearts, but he must not touch the
widow, although the points in it will count for him at the end.
Each point under or over 60 is worth two counters in Chico.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Grand</b></i> outbids Chico, and is the highest bid possible. Hearts
must be trumps, and the player offering this game must not touch
the widow until the play is finished. Every point under or over 60
in a Grand is worth four counters.</p>

<p>The bidder must play the game he names. He cannot bid Frog
and play Chico, or bid Chico and play Grand. The settling up of
the scores at the end, if the payments are not made at once in
counters, is the same as in Skat.</p>

<h3>CRIBBAGE.</h3>

<p>Cribbage is not only one of the oldest of the games upon the
cards, but enjoys the distinction of being quite unlike any other
game, both in the manner of playing it, and in the system of reckoning
the points. It is also peculiar from the fact that it is one of
the very few really good games which require no effort of the
memory; judgment and finesse being the qualities chiefly requisite
for success.</p>

<p>There are two principal varieties of the game; <i><b>Five</b></i> and <i><b>Six-card</b></i>
Cribbage; and these again are divided according to the number
of players. The old writers agree in speaking of the five-card
game as the more scientific; but the modern verdict is in favour
of the six-card game, which is certainly the more common and
popular. The skill in Five-card Cribbage is limited to laying out
for the crib and securing the “go”; but in Six-card Cribbage,
while the scientific principles applicable to the crib remain the
same as in the five-card game, there is abundant room for the display
of skill all through, the hand being as important as the crib,
and the play sometimes more important than either. The six-card
game will be first described.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Cribbage is played with a full pack of fifty-two
cards, which have no rank except the order of their sequence;
K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 A, the Ace being always the lowest, either in
cutting or in play. The cards have also a counting or pip value,
the three court cards, K Q J, and the 10 being worth ten points
each. All other cards, including the Ace, retain their face value.
There are no trumps, and the four suits are therefore equal in
value at all times.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKERS.</b></i> The game is 61 points, and is scored or
“pegged” on a cribbage board, which has a double row of 30
holes on each side, and a game-hole at each end. The players
are each provided with two pegs, and they score the points as they
accrue by advancing their pegs from left to right according to the
number of points they make. For instance: One player makes 6<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
for his first count. He places one of his pegs in the sixth hole
from the left-hand end of the board. Then he makes 4, and
places the second peg four holes in advance of the first, which
will show that his total score is ten points. The third time he
makes 2, which he scores by lifting out the back peg and putting
it two holes in advance of the first one. This system of pegging
not only shows the total number of points made by either player,
but enables the adversary to check the count, as a glance at the
distance between the two pegs will show the number of points
pegged last time.</p>

<p>When a player reaches the extreme right of the board, 30
points, he crosses over to the inner row of holes, and goes down
from right to left. On reaching the end of the second row he has
still one more to go to get into the game-hole, which is in the
middle of the board.</p>

<p>When one player reaches his game-hole before the other turns
the corner, it is called a <i><b>lurch</b></i>, and counts two games.</p>

<p>The pegs are so often lose or mislaid that it is much more convenient
to use a <i><b>pull-up</b></i> cribbage board, in which every hole is
provided with its own peg, which may be raised to indicate the
count. The back pegs can be either left standing or pushed
down again.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p443.jpg" width="300" height="100" alt="A pull-up cribbage board" />
</div>

<p>The board is always placed midway between the players.</p>

<p>If three persons play, a triangular board is necessary. This
is provided with three sets of holes and three game holes.</p>

<p>When a cribbage board is not at hand, the game may be kept
by ruling a sheet of paper into ten divisions, and marking them
with the figures 1 to 0 on each side:</p>

<p>Each player being provided with two coins, one silver and one
copper, (or different sizes,) the copper coin can be advanced from
point to point to count units, and the silver coin will mark the tens.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Cribbage is distinctly a game for two players,
although three may play, each for himself, or four, two being partners
against the other two. When two play, one is known as the
<i><b>dealer</b></i>, and the other as the non-dealer, or the <i><b>pone</b></i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> The players cut for the choice of seats, and
for the first deal. The lowest cut has the choice, and deals the
first hand. The Ace is low. If a player exposes more than
one card he must cut again. Ties are also decided by cutting
again.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> Cribbage is played for so much a game, lurches
counting double. Players may either settle at the end of each
game, or score on a sheet of paper. In the pull-up cribbage
boards there are nine extra pegs for counting games won. These
are placed in a line with the player’s game hole at each end.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> The cards are shuffled and presented to the
pone to be cut, and he must leave at least six cards in each packet.
Six cards are dealt to each player, one at a time in rotation, beginning
with the player on the dealer’s left if there are more than
two. No trump is turned, and the remainder of the pack is placed
face downward at the end of the cribbage board on the dealer’s
left.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities.</b></i> It is a misdeal if any card is found faced
in the pack, or if the pack is found to be imperfect, and there must
be a fresh deal by the same dealer. Any previous cuts or scores
made with the imperfect pack stand good. A player dealing out
of turn may be stopped before the non-dealer lifts his cards from
the table. The penalty for dealing out of turn is two points, if
the error is detected in time; otherwise the deal stands good.</p>

<p>If the dealer neglects to have the pack cut, exposes a card in
dealing, gives too many or too few cards to any player, deals a
card incorrectly, and fails to remedy the error before dealing
another, or exposes one of his adversary’s cards, the non-dealer
scores two points by way of penalty. He also has the option of
demanding a fresh deal by the same dealer, or of letting the
deal stand. If the error is simply an irregularity in the manner of
dealing, or an exposed card, the pone must decide without looking
at his cards. If either player has too many or too few cards, the
pone may look at the hand dealt him before deciding whether or
not to have a fresh deal; but if it is the pone himself that has too
many or too few cards, he must discover and announce the error
before lifting his cards from the table, or he will not be entitled to
the option of letting the deal stand. If the pone has too many
cards he may return the surplus to the top of the pack, without
showing or naming them. If the dealer has too many, the pone
may draw from his hand face downward, returning the surplus to
the top of the pack; but the pone may not look at the cards so
drawn unless the dealer has seen them. If there are too few cards,
and the pone elects to have the deal stand, the deficiency must be
supplied from the top of the pack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>THE CRIB.</b></i> The cards dealt, each player takes up his
six cards and examines them with a view to laying out two cards,
face downward, for the crib; leaving himself four cards with which
to play. The four cards which form the crib, two from each hand,
always belong to the dealer, and it is usual for each player, in discarding
for the crib, to slip his two cards under the end of the
cribbage board opposite to that occupied by the remainder of the
pack.</p>

<p>Cards once laid out for the crib, and the hand removed from
them, cannot be taken up again. A penalty of two points may be
scored by the adversary for each card so taken up again, whether
it is returned to the player’s hand or not. If either player confuses
his cards in any manner with those of the crib, his adversary
scores two points, and may also claim a fresh deal.</p>

<p>If it is not discovered until he comes to lay out for the crib, that
a player has too many cards, the same rules apply that are given
for misdealing; but if he has too few cards there is no remedy, as
he has lifted his hand. He must lay out two cards for the crib
and play with what remain, his adversary scoring two points
penalty at the same time.</p>

<p><i><b>THE STARTER.</b></i> Both players having discarded for the
crib, the non-dealer cuts the remainder of the pack, and the dealer
lifts the top card from the portion left on the table, turning it face
up. The two portions being again united, the turned card is
placed face up on the pack, and is known as the starter, because
it forms the starting-point in the count for every hand and crib.
At least four cards must be left in each packet in cutting for the
starter. If the starter is found face up, there must be a new deal.</p>

<p>If the starter is a Jack, the dealer immediately pegs two points
<i><b>for his heels</b></i>. If he does not peg these two holes before he plays
a card the score is lost. If the Jack of the same suit as the starter
is found in the hand or crib of any player, it is called <i><b>his nobs</b></i>, and
when the hand is reckoned up after the play is over, one point may
be scored for it.</p>

<p>If the dealer exposes more than one card after the pack has
been properly cut, his adversary may choose which of the exposed
cards shall be the starter.</p>

<p>In order to understand the motives which govern the players in
discarding, and the influences which the starter has upon the value
of the hands and crib, it will be necessary to describe the objects of
the game, before giving the method of play.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> The chief object in Cribbage
is to form and to preserve various counting combinations.
As these combinations occur in the course of play, or are shown
in the hand or crib after the play is over, their value in points is
pegged on the cribbage board, and the player who first pegs a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
sufficient number of these combinations to reach a total of 61
points, wins the game.</p>

<p>There are five principal varieties of these counting combinations:
Pairs, Triplets, Fours, Sequences, and Fifteens; besides some
minor counts which will be spoken of in their proper place.</p>

<p>The various counting combinations in Cribbage may arise in
two ways. They may be formed by combining the cards played
by one person with those played by his adversary; or they may be
found in the individual hand or crib after the play is over. In the
latter case the starter is considered as part of each hand and crib,
increasing each of them to five available counting cards.</p>

<p><i><b>Pairs.</b></i> A pair is any two cards of the same denomination,
such as two Fives or two Queens, and its counting value is always
the same, 2 points. <i><b>Triplets</b></i>, usually called Pairs Royal, Proils,
or Prials, are any three cards of the same denomination, such as
three Nines. Their value is the number of separate pairs that
can be formed with the three cards, which is three, and the combination
is therefore always worth 6 points. The different pairs
that can be formed with three Nines, for instance, would be as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;">
<img src="images/p446a.jpg" width="385" height="75" alt="🂹 🃙 | 🂹 🂩 | 🃙 🂩" />
</div>

<p><i><b>Fours</b></i>, sometimes called Double Pairs Royal, or Deproils, are
any four cards of the same denomination, such as four Fours, and
their counting value is the number of separate pairs that can be
formed with the four cards, which is six. The combination is
therefore always worth 12 points. The different combinations of
four cards, arranged in pairs, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p446b.jpg" width="400" height="150" alt="🂴 🃔 | 🂴 🂤 | 🂴 🃄 | 🃔 🂤 | 🃔 🃄 | 🂤 🃄" />
</div>

<p>Whether the foregoing combinations are formed during the play
of the hand, or found in the hand or crib after the play is over,
their counting value is exactly the same.</p>

<p><i><b>Sequences.</b></i> Any three or more cards, following one another
in numerical order, will form a sequence. A sequence may also
run into the court cards, such as 9 10 J, 10 J Q, or J Q K; but
Q K A is not a sequence in Cribbage. The counting value of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
sequence is one point for each card in it. Sequences formed in
the course of play must always be single, although the cards forming
them need not fall in regular order. Those found in the hand
or crib may be double, and those formed with the aid of the starter
may be treble or quadruple.</p>

<p>The method of computing the value of double and treble
sequences should be thoroughly understood, in order that such
combinations may be counted at sight. A few examples will show
that each combination belongs to a certain class, to which the
same counting value is always attached. These classes are distinguished
by the number of duplicates of the sequence cards.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 215px;">
<img src="images/p447a.jpg" width="215" height="75" alt="🂲 🃓 🂴 🂤" />
</div>

<p>If you hold three cards which form
a sequence, and have also a duplicate
of any one of them, no matter
which, it is evident that by substituting
the card of equal value you can
form another sequence. Such combinations are therefore always
worth 8 points, 6 for the <i><b>double run</b></i>, as it is called, and 2 for
the pair, no matter what the cards are that form the combination.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/p447b.jpg" width="260" height="75" alt="🂢 🂲 🃒 🃃 🃔" />
</div>

<p>If the five cards in the hand
and starter together contain a
run of three with two duplicates,
it is evident that three
separate sequences can be
formed by using each of the duplicates alternately. Such combinations
are always worth 15 points; 9 for the triple run of three,
and 6 for the pair royal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/p447c.jpg" width="260" height="75" alt="🃑 🃁 🃒 🂳 🃓" />
</div>

<p>If the duplicates are of two
different cards, no matter
which, it will be found that
four different sequences of
three cards each can be formed
by changing the Aces and Threes alternately. Such combinations
are therefore always worth 16 points: four runs of three, worth 12,
and 4 points for the two separate pairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/p447d.jpg" width="260" height="75" alt="🂡 🂢 🂳 🃔 🃄" />
</div>

<p>If the five cards contain
one sequence of four, and one
duplicate, the combination
will always be worth 10
points; 8 for the double run
of four, and 2 for the pair.</p>

<p>The foregoing should be thoroughly familiar to every player, so
that he may know the exact value of the combination the moment
he sees the length of the sequence and the number of duplicates.</p>

<p><i><b>Two-card Fifteens.</b></i> Any combination of two or more
cards, the total face value of which is exactly 15, is called <i><b>fifteen-two</b></i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
because each fifteen so formed is worth two points in the
pegging. There are only three combinations of two cards which
will form fifteen; a Five with any court card or Ten; a Nine and
a Six; an Eight and a Seven. The manner of counting duplicates
is the same as that employed for the pairs and sequences, and the
player should be equally familiar with each variety of combination.
The fifteens formed by <i><b>two cards</b></i> only are the simplest, and
should be studied first.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 160px;">
<img src="images/p448a.jpg" width="160" height="75" alt="🂮 🂻 🂥" />
</div>

<p>It is obvious that if there is in the hand
or the starter a duplicate of either of the
cards forming the fifteen, no matter which,
another fifteen can be formed, and the combination
will therefore always be worth 6
points; 4 for the two fifteens, and 2 for the pair. It must not be
forgotten that in the case of <i><b>tenth cards</b></i>, as they are called, the
duplicates may not form pairs, as for instance with K J 5. The
fifteen is duplicated, but there is no pair.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/p448b.jpg" width="220" height="75" alt="🂩 🃉 🃙 🂦" />
</div>

<p>If there are two duplicates of either
card, the combination will always be
worth 12 points; 6 for the three fifteens,
and 6 more for the pair royal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/p448c.jpg" width="220" height="75" alt="🂹 🃙 🃆 🂶" />
</div>

<p>If the duplicates are of two different
cards, the combination is still
worth 12, because four different fifteens
can be formed by combining
each Nine with each Six separately,
and there are two single pairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/p448d.jpg" width="260" height="150" alt="🃙 🃆 🂶 🃖 🂦 | 🂹 🂩 🃉 🃖 🂦" />
</div>

<p>The same is true of any
combinations of two-card fifteens
in which all five cards
are of value; they are both of
the same pegging value, 20
points. If there are three
duplicates of one card in the
original fifteen, the four separate
fifteens will be worth 8,
and the double pair royal 12.
If there are two duplicates of one card, and one of the other, six
separate fifteens can be formed by combining each Nine with each
Six, pegging 12; and the pair royal of one card with the single
pair of the other will add 8 more.</p>

<p><i><b>Three-card Fifteens</b></i> may be formed in fifteen different
ways, ranging from 10 4 A, to 5 5 5. If you hold any of these
combinations, and have a fourth card which is a duplicate of any
of the three forming the fifteen, the value of the combination will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
depend on how many cards you can replace with the duplicate
card.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/p449a.jpg" width="220" height="75" alt="🂾 🃞 🃔 🂡" />
</div>

<p>If you have an extra tenth card,
you can replace the other tenth card
once only, and the total value of the
combination is therefore 6 points,
which is expressed by the formula;
“Fifteen-two, fifteen-four, and a pair.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/p449b.jpg" width="220" height="75" alt="🃙 🂳 🃓 🂣" />
</div>

<p>If your combination was 9 3 3, and
you had another 9, the same thing
would be true; but if your duplicate
is a Three, there are two cards which
can be replaced, and the combination
is therefore worth 12; 6 for the three fifteens, and 6 more for the
pair royal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/p449c.jpg" width="220" height="75" alt="🂵 🃕 🃅 🂥" />
</div>

<p>If your combination is one in which
all three cards can be replaced with
the duplicate, making three extra
fifteens, it must be worth 20 altogether;
8 for the four fifteens, and 12
for the double pair royal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/p449d.jpg" width="260" height="75" alt="🂢 🃖 🂷 🂧 🃇" />
</div>

<p>If you have two duplicates
of any one card in the original
combination, there are only
two extra fifteens, and the
combination will be worth 12;
6 for the three fifteens, and 6 more for the pair royal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/p449e.jpg" width="260" height="75" alt="🃒 🂦 🃖 🂷 🃗" />
</div>

<p>If you have duplicates of
two different cards you can
form four fifteens; because
you can replace the Seven
first, and then the Six, and then
put the first Seven back again with the new Six. This will make
the combination of the same value as if you had three duplicates
of one card, 12 points; 8 for the four fifteens, and 4 for the two
single pairs.</p>

<p><i><b>Combinations.</b></i> The beginner’s greatest difficulty is in counting
hands which contain all three varieties of counts; pairs,
sequences, and fifteens. But if he is familiar with the values of
the various combinations taken separately, he will have no difficulty
in computing them when they are found together. Some regular
order should be observed in going over the hands, so that nothing
shall be forgotten. The majority of players begin with the fifteens,
as they are more liable to be overlooked, and then reckon the
value of the runs and pairs together.</p>

<p>No. 1 contains a fifteen in addition to the three runs of three
and the pair royal, and is therefore worth 17 altogether. Nos. 2
and 3 each contain three fifteens; but No. 2 is worth 21 points on
account of the three runs of three and the pair royal, while No. 3
is worth only 16; a double run of four and a single pair. No. 4
contains four fifteens in addition to the four runs of three and two
single pairs, and is therefore worth 24 points.</p>

<p>The best combination that can be held in hand or crib is three
Fives and a Jack, with the Five of the same suit as the Jack for a
starter. We have already seen that the four Fives by themselves
are worth 20, to which we must add the four extra fifteens
made by combining the Jack with each Five separately, and one
more point for his nobs, 29 altogether. If the Jack was the
starter, the combination would be worth 30 to the dealer, but his
heels would have to be counted before a card was played.</p>

<p><i><b>Flushes.</b></i> In addition to the foregoing combinations, if all
four cards in the hand are of the same suit the player can peg
four points for the flush; if the starter is also the same suit, five
points. A flush does not count in the crib unless the starter is
the same suit, and then it counts five points. Flushes are never
made in play.</p>

<p><i><b>Laying Out for the Crib.</b></i> With this knowledge of the
objects of game, and the various counting combinations, it will be
seen that each player should keep the cards which count the most
for him, or which are most likely to form good combinations with
different starters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>Suppose the non-dealer holds these cards:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;">

</div>

<p>If he puts the two Eights in his adversary’s crib, he not only
gives him two very good cards, which go to form a great many
valuable combinations, but he leaves himself absolutely nothing
but 2 points for a single fifteen, formed by the 9 and 6. It would
be a little better, but still very bad play, for him to discard the 8
and 6, leaving himself a sequence of four cards and a fifteen, 6
points altogether. He might do a little better by discarding the 10
and 8, leaving himself a run of four, and two fifteens, 8 points
altogether. If he discards either the 10 and 9, or the 10 and 6, he
will leave himself a double run of three, a pair, and two fifteens,
12 altogether. Of these two discards, that of the 10 and 6 is
better than the 10 and 9, because the 10 and 9 might help to form
a sequence in the adversary’s crib, whereas the 10 and 6 are so
far apart that they are very unlikely to be of any use.</p>

<p>Cards which are likely to form parts of sequences are called
<i><b>close cards</b></i>, and those which are too widely separated to do so
are called <i><b>wide cards</b></i>.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The crib laid out and the
starter cut, the pone begins by playing any card he pleases. The
card he selects he lays face upward on the table on his own side of
the cribbage board, and at the same time announces its pip value;
two, five, or ten, whatever it may be. It is then the dealer’s turn
to play a card from his hand, which is also laid face upward on the
table, but on the dealer’s side of the cribbage board. Instead of
announcing the pip value of this second card, the dealer calls out
the total value of the two cards taken together. The pone then
lays another card on the table face upward and on the top of the
first, which is not turned face down, and at the same time announces
the total pip value of the three cards so far played; the
dealer plays again, and so on.</p>

<p>If at any time the total pip value of the cards played is exactly
15 or 31, the one who plays the card that brings it to that number
pegs two points for it at once. If any counting combination, such
as a pair, pair royal, or sequence, is formed by the cards played,
its value is pegged by the person that plays the card which completes
the combination; but neither player is allowed to play a
card which will make the total pip value of the cards played pass
31. The method of forming and pegging these various combinations
in play will be better understood if they are described separately.
A card once played cannot be taken up again, unless it
passes 31.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Pairs.</b></i> If the first card played by the pone should be a 6, and
the dealer had a 6 also, the latter would probably play it, announcing:
“Twelve, with a pair,” and pegging two holes. If the pone
held a third six he would immediately play it, announcing:
“Eighteen, with a pair royal,” and would peg six holes for the
three pairs which can be formed with the three Sixes, although
he did not hold all of them. If the dealer was fortunate enough
to hold the fourth Six he might rejoin with: “Twenty-four, with a
double-pair-royal.” This would entitle him to peg twelve more
holes, although he had already pegged the single pair.</p>

<p><i><b>Sequences.</b></i> Suppose the first card played by the pone was a
4. The dealer plays a 2, announcing: “Six.” The pone plays a
3, announcing: “Nine, with a run of three,” and pegging three
holes for the sequence formed in play. The dealer plays an Ace;
“Ten, with a run of four,” and pegs four holes for the sequence
of four cards made in play, all of which are face upward on the
table, although he held only two of them.</p>

<p><i><b>Fifteens.</b></i> The pone then plays a 5, which, added to the 10
just announced by the dealer, makes 15, with a run of five cards;
seven holes to peg altogether. (This is quite independent of the
sequence previously scored, just as the double pair royal was of the
previous single pair.) The dealer now plays a deuce, and announces
seventeen. This card does not form any sequence with those
that have gone immediately before it, because if the order of play
is retraced it will be found that another deuce is encountered before
we reach the Four. This illustrates the rule already given, that
sequences formed in play must always be single, and cannot be
reckoned with substitute cards, like pairs royal. If they could, the
last player in this case might claim a double run of five and a pair.</p>

<p>The pone now plays another 4, which forms the sequence afresh
if we go back to the third card played. He announces: “Twenty-one,
with a run of five,” and pegs five holes more. The dealer
plays a 3, also claiming a run of five, which he pegs, and as that is
the last card to be played in that hand he also pegs one hole for
<i><b>last card</b></i>.</p>

<p>The total score of the dealer is now 10 points, and that of the
pone is 15. The cards they held, and the order in which they
were played is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i><b>SHOWING.</b></i> In order to illustrate the manner of counting
the hands, which is called showing, let us suppose the starter to be
a Queen, and that the pone discarded an Ace and a Ten for the
crib, the dealer laying out two Jacks.</p>

<p>The non-dealer always has the first show, as an offset to the advantage
of the dealer’s crib. The pone therefore shows his hand,
which, combined with the starter, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/p453a.jpg" width="280" height="75" alt="🂭   🃃 🂤 🃔 🃕" />
</div>

<p>This is worth 10 holes; the run of three with one duplicate is
always worth 8, and the fifteen formed by the starter and the Five
counts 2 more. This puts the pone’s total score to 25 points.</p>

<p>The dealer then counts, showing his hand first. This, with the
starter, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/p453b.jpg" width="280" height="75" alt="🂭   🂱 🂲 🃂 🃓" />
</div>

<p>This is worth 14 holes. In addition to the run of three with
one duplicate, three fifteens can be formed by combining the
starter and a Three with each of the deuces, and then taking the
starter and the Ace with both the deuces together. This puts the
dealer’s total score to 24, with the crib still to count. This is as
follows, with the starter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/p453c.jpg" width="280" height="75" alt="🂭   🃛 🂫 🃚 🂡" />
</div>

<p>This is worth 9 holes; 8 for the run of three with one duplicate,
and 1 for his nobs. There are no fifteens, and the Ace is worthless.
This puts the dealer three holes round the corner, and on
the homestretch for the game hole.</p>

<p>The deal now passes to the player that was the pone, and the
next crib will belong to him.</p>

<p>Beginners often experience difficulty in deciding when a run has
been made in play, and when it has not. If there is any dispute
about it, the cards should be placed as shown in these diagrams,
and if any duplicate is encountered before the run is complete, it
cannot be pegged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>Take the following examples:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">
<img src="images/p454a.jpg" width="380" height="120" alt="Cards alternate: pone/dealer. 🂡 🃅 🃒 🂲 🃖 🃓 🃄" />
</div>

<p>There is no sequence, because we encounter a duplicate deuce
before we reach the Five. If the last player had a Five to play
now, it would make a run of five cards, stopping at the deuce of
hearts. Take the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/p454b.jpg" width="440" height="120" alt="Cards alternate: pone/dealer. 🂦 🂣 🃑 🂤 🃅 🃁 🃒 🂶" />
</div>

<p>There is no sequence; but if the pone had played his Five for
his second card, the dealer would have pegged two runs; one of
four, and one of six, besides the last card; the pone making one
run of five and a pair, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/p454c.jpg" width="440" height="120" alt="Cards alternate: pone/dealer. 🂦 🂣 🃅 🂤 🃒 🃁 🃑 🂶" />
</div>

<p>It will be seen that if the dealer had not played his Ace and
kept his Six at the last, the pone would have pegged eleven holes
on him, instead of seven.</p>

<p><i><b>Go, and Thirty-one.</b></i> When a person has no card which he
can play without making the total pip value of all the cards played
more than 31, he must say to his adversary: “Go.” That is,
“Go on and play, for I cannot.” If his adversary has no cards
left, the player must say “go” to himself. When a person is told
to go, he must play as many cards as he can without passing 31.
If he reaches 31 exactly, he scores two points; if he cannot quite
reach it, he scores one point for the go. The principle is that if 31
cannot be made by either player, the one playing the card that
brought the count nearest to it shall count one for it, even if he
has told himself to go. There is no count for “last card” if it
makes 31. But the “last card” counts if it makes 15.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>If a player tells another to go when he can still play himself, he
forfeits two points, and his adversary may, if he chooses, take
back the cards to the point where the error occurred and have
them played over again. The same penalty can be enforced
against a player who pegs for a go when he can still play.</p>

<p>Suppose the first card played is a Jack. The dealer, holding
two Nines, an Eight, and a Five, plays the Five, and pegs 2 for
the fifteen. The pone plays a Nine, announcing the total as
twenty-four. The dealer cannot pair this Nine, because it would
run the count past 31, neither can he play the Eight, so he says,
“Go.” The pone pegs the go without playing, which shows that
he is also unable to play, having nothing so small as a Seven.</p>

<p>Both then turn down the cards already played, and the one
whose turn it is to play begins all over again with his remaining
cards or card, announcing its face value, his adversary playing
after him until their cards are exhausted or they reach another 31.</p>

<p>To continue the foregoing example, let us suppose the dealer to
play one of his Nines. The pone plays a Jack, and announces
“Nineteen.” The dealer plays his remaining Nine, and calls
“Twenty-eight.” The pone tells him to go, and he pegs one.
These three cards are turned down. The pone then plays a Ten,
and the dealer marks one for the last card. The hands and crib
are then shown.</p>

<p>If either player can reach exactly 31, he scores two points for it,
whether he has been told to go or not. Suppose the pone begins
with a Nine. The dealer plays a Six and pegs 2 for the fifteen.
The pone pairs the Six, calls “Twenty-one,” and pegs 2 for the
pair. The dealer with two Fives and a Four in his hand, plays
the Four, and calls “Twenty-five,” hoping the pone has no small
card, which will allow the dealer to make a run of three with one
of his Fives if he is told to go. But the pone plays a Five, calling:
“Thirty, with a run of three.” The dealer tells him to go,
and he plays an Ace, pegging two holes for the 31. The cards
are all turned down, and the pone having no cards, the dealer
plays his two Fives, and pegs a pair and the last card. The pair
counts in this case because the adversary has no cards to interfere
with it. A run of three might be played and scored in the
same way, because the score for combinations made in play are
determined by the order in which the cards are played, irrespective
of who plays them.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in Hands.</b></i> If a player is found to have too
many or too few cards, after he has laid out for the crib, his adversary
pegs two points, and may also claim a fresh deal. If the
deal is allowed to stand, superfluous cards must be drawn at random
by the adversary, who may look at the card or cards so
drawn before placing them in the pack. If either player is found
to have too few cards after having laid out for the crib, he has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
remedy. His adversary pegs two points, and the short hand must
be played and shown for what it is worth.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregular Cribs.</b></i> If the superfluous card is found in the
crib, and the non-dealer had the short hand, the dealer may
reckon all the combinations he can make in the six-card crib; but
if it was the dealer who had the short hand, the superfluous crib
is void. If the crib contains a superfluous card, both the players
having their right number, the non-dealer pegs two holes for the
evident misdeal, and the crib is void. If both players have their
right number, and the crib is short, it must be shown for what it
is worth; but the non-dealer pegs two holes for the evident misdeal.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregular Announcements.</b></i> There is no penalty if a
player announces a wrong number as the total of the cards played,
provided he does not peg an erroneous fifteen or thirty-one. If
the following player does not correct the announcement, but plays
and adds to it, the error cannot be rectified. If any holes are
pegged for an erroneous announcement, the adversary may demand
that they be taken down again, and may add the number to
his own score.</p>

<p><i><b>Miscounting.</b></i> If a player over-counts his hand, crib, or play,
and pegs the points erroneously claimed, his adversary may call
attention to the error, demand that the superfluous points be
taken down again, and may add them to his own score as penalty.
Should a player neglect to peg the full value of his hand, crib, or
play, his adversary may add the neglected points to his own score,
after pointing out the omission. Should a player be mistaken in
exacting either of these penalties, he must not only take down
what he pegged, but allow his adversary to peg the same number
as penalty.</p>

<p>None of these corrections can be claimed until the player in
error has pegged and quitted the score; that is, removed his fingers
from the front peg. The claim should always be prefaced by
the word <i><b>Muggins</b></i>. If the error is one of omission in play, the
adversary must play his own card before claiming muggins. If it
is in the hand or crib, the adversary must wait until the points
claimed are pegged and quitted. If there are no points claimed,
he must wait until the cards are turned face down, thus acknowledging
that there is apparently nothing to score. A player is not
allowed to tell his adversary whether or not he has counted his
hand or crib correctly, until it is pegged.</p>

<p><i><b>Nineteen.</b></i> As it is impossible to hold 19 in hand or crib, it is
a common practice for a player, when he has nothing at all to
score, to announce, “Nineteen.” The numbers twenty-seven,
twenty-six and twenty-five are also impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Pegging.</b></i> Neither player is allowed to touch the other’s pegs.
If the score is erroneous, the player in fault must be called upon
to remedy it himself. A player whose pegs are touched by his adversary
can score two holes for penalty. If a player removes his
adversary’s front peg, the latter may immediately claim the game.
If a player displaces his own front peg, he must place it behind
the other. If both players displace their front pegs, as by accident,
they may agree to replace them where they believe them to
have stood; but if they cannot agree they must call the game
void.</p>

<p><i><b>Pegging Out.</b></i> In pegging during the play, the first man to
reach his game hole wins, no matter what either may have in hand
or crib. If neither can peg out in play, the non-dealer has the
first show. If he cannot show out, the dealer proceeds to count
his hand and then his crib. If he cannot show out there must be
a new deal.</p>

<p><i><b>CHEATING.</b></i> The greatest advantage at Cribbage is to
secure good starters, and for this purpose the greek adopts various
methods of trimming and marking the cards so that he may secure
a starter exactly suited to his hand. After trimming certain
cards a trifle longer or shorter than others, the pack to be cut may
be presented to the pone in such a manner that he will unconsciously
lift them either by the ends or the sides, according to the
wish of the dealer, and so uncover a starter exactly suited to the
dealer’s hand or crib. When the sharper has the cut, he can of
course uncover any card he pleases. With marked edges, the
pone can cut down to a card of any desired denomination. Some
audacious gamblers make it a rule to get a starter by simply removing
the top card and turning up the next one. It is needless
to say that the second card has been carefully pre-arranged. Any
person who fingers the pack longer than necessary in cutting starters,
or who cuts sometimes by the edge and sometimes by the side,
will bear watching. Marked cards and second dealing are great
weapons in a game where so much depends on a knowledge of the
adversary’s hand, and on securing good counting cards for yourself.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> In the six-card
game the hand is more valuable than the crib, because you know
what it contains, whereas the crib is largely speculative. In the
five-card game, in which there are only three cards in the hand
and four in the crib, it is usual to sacrifice the hand very largely
for the possibilities of the crib, because of the much larger scores
that can be made with five cards, the starter and four in the crib.</p>

<p><i><b>Baulking.</b></i> In both games it is the duty of the pone to baulk
the dealer’s crib as much as possible, by laying out cards which are
very unlikely to be worth anything, either in making fifteens or in
filling up sequences. Pairs it is impossible to provide against, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
the chance of making a flush is remote, but should be avoided if
there is any choice. The best baulk is a King and Nine; tenth
cards and Aces are also very good cards to lay out. Cards which
are at least two pips apart, called <i><b>wide cards</b></i>, are better than
<i><b>close cards</b></i>, as the latter may form sequences. Fives are very
bad discards, and so are any cards that form a five or a fifteen.</p>

<p><i><b>The Crib.</b></i> In laying out for his own crib, the dealer should
preserve his own hand as much as possible; but other things
being equal, the best cards to lay out are pairs, close cards, and
cards that form fives, such as Fours and Aces. If these elements
can be combined, so much the better. An Eight and a Seven, for
instance, are not only close cards, being only one pip apart, but
form a fifteen. The same is true of a trey and deuce.</p>

<p><i><b>Keeping.</b></i> In selecting the hand to keep, much depends on
the score. Early in the game you want a counting hand; near the
end, especially if you have only four or five points to go, you want
a pegging hand; that is, one with every card different, so that you
can pair several cards, or make fifteens with almost anything that
the pone may lead. In keeping a counting hand, much depends
on whether it is good in itself, or needs a starter. In reckoning on
the possibilities of the starter, it must never be forgotten that there
are sixteen tenth cards in the pack, and that they are therefore the
most probable starters of all. It is better to keep sequences open
at both ends than those open in the middle. With two Sevens
and two Eights, either a Six or a Nine will make your hand worth
24; but with two Eights and two Sixes, nothing but a Seven will
improve your hand more than 4 points. Sequences are the best
to keep, especially those of three cards with a duplicate. After
them pairs royal are valuable, and next to them cards which will
make a number of fives in various combinations, such as two Threes
and two deuces.</p>

<p><i><b>Leading.</b></i> There are two systems of playing, known as
<i><b>playing off</b></i>, and <i><b>playing on</b></i>, and they are selected according
to the player’s position in the score. Long experience has shown
that in six-card Cribbage the average expectation of the non-dealer
for his hand and play is 12 points; and for the dealer, in hand,
crib, and play, is 17. This being so, each player having had a
deal, their scores should be about 29. If a player is 29 or more,
he is said to be <i><b>at home</b></i>; and if he is seven or more points ahead
of his adversary on even deals, he is said to be <i><b>safe at home</b></i>.
When a player is safe at home, he should play off; that is, take no
chances of scoring himself that might give his adversary a chance
to make a still better score. This is usually found in the method
of playing sequences. A player who avoids playing cards that
might lead up to a run is said to play off. If he invites the run,
hoping to make it longer himself, he is said to play on. When a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
player is behind, it is better for him to play on, and to seize every
chance to score, especially with sequences. As it is considered an
advantage to be ahead on the first deal, most players prefer a forward
game on the opening hand.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing Off.</b></i> In this it is best to play cards on which it is
unlikely that your adversary can score. Lead Aces, Twos and
Threes, which cannot be made into fifteens. Do not pair his cards
unless you have a card which will make you a double pair royal,
(without passing 31,) if he should make a pair royal on you. Do
not play close cards which he may turn into sequences.</p>

<p>Never play a card which will allow the adversary to make a
double score, such as a pair and a fifteen, or a sequence and a
fifteen at the same time. Such as the following are all bad plays:
9 on 3; 7 on A; 6 on 3, 4, or 5; 5 on 5; 4 on 7; 3 on 9; A on 7.
All these expose you to the immediate rejoinder of a double count.
Of course, if you have the card to make a pair royal in return, that
is another matter, and is playing on, not playing off.</p>

<p>Do not play a card which brings the pip count to 5 or 21 if you
can help it; because any tenth card will enable your adversary to
peg two holes. Be a little wary about pairing the first card played,
unless you have a third of the same denomination. If you have a
choice between a pair and a sequence, your decision will depend
on whether you are playing off or on. If you are playing off,
make the pair, and take no chances of long runs.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing On.</b></i> In this you play to give your adversary a count,
hoping to make a better yourself. It is always advantageous to
play one of a pair, and to begin with one end of a sequence. If
he pairs your first card, you can reply with a pair royal. If he
plays to make a sequence, you can sometimes hold him off until
you get the score, and he will be unable to continue the run without
passing 31. Play one of two cards that form a five, such as 3
and 2; 4 and A. If he plays a tenth card to it, you can peg fifteen.
In playing on, you should make all the sequences possible,
taking chances of your adversary’s being able to continue the run.
If you think he is leading you on, you must be guided by the state
of the score as to how much you can risk.</p>

<p>Toward the end, you must reckon pretty closely how many
points you can afford to risk your adversary’s making without
putting him out. If you have enough in your hand to get out on
the show, you should not attempt to make a single point in play.
Pair nothing, for he might come out with a pair royal; make no
runs, for he might extend them. But if you have not enough to
show out, you must take every chance to peg the difference, because
if you cannot get out in play and first show, the dealer has not
only both hand and crib against you, but the first show on the
next deal. In six-card Cribbage, the usual pegging for the play is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
five holes for the dealer, and four or five for the non-dealer. By
adding this expectation to your show, you can see how many you
can hope to peg yourself, and how many the dealer will probably
be on hand, crib and peg altogether. The hands should average
7 points, and the cribs 5.</p>

<h4>FIVE-CARD CRIBBAGE.</h4>

<p>In this form of the game only five cards are dealt to each player,
one at a time. Two of these are laid out for the crib, and the
three remaining are used in play, exactly as in the six-card game.</p>

<p><i><b>Three for Last.</b></i> The non-dealer on the first hand of each
game is allowed to peg three holes as a compensation for the advantage
his adversary derives from having the first deal. Although
the rules allow these three to be pegged at any time during
the game, they should be put up immediately, in order to avoid
disputes.</p>

<p>There is no further play after a go is declared, or either player
has reached 31. The score for 31 is two holes; and for the go,
one hole. Great importance is attached to the score for the go at
five-card Cribbage, because so little is made in play that every
point counts.</p>

<p><i><b>The Crib.</b></i> This is the most important thing in the five-card
game, and it is much more important to baulk your adversary’s
crib than to preserve your own hand. The best baulking cards
are a King with a 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 or A. Never lay out a Jack, nor
two cards which form a five, nor any pair, nor any two close cards.
In laying out for your own crib, Fives, Sevens and Eights are the
best. Any pair, any two cards that make five or fifteen, and any
close cards are also good. Keep pairs royal and runs in your
hand, and do not forget that a flush of three counts in the hand;
but the starter must agree to make a flush in the crib.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing Off and On.</b></i> The pegging in play is usually small;
2 for the dealer, and an average of 1½ for the non-dealer, hence
the importance of the go. The average hand is a little less than 5,
and the crib about 5. The player is at home if he has pegged 17
in two deals, his own and his adversary’s. He is safe at home if
he is 7 ahead, or his adversary is 7 behind.</p>

<p>In Five-card Cribbage, more than any other game, it is true
that a game is never won until it is lost. Take the following example,
in which the pone is 56 up, and the dealer has pegged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
only 5 holes altogether. The separated cards show those laid out
for the crib, and the odd card is the starter.</p>

<table summary="Illustrative example">

    <td class="valign">Pone:&mdash;</td>
    <td rowspan="2"><img src="images/p461.jpg" width="370" height="150" alt="Cards alternate: pone/dealer. 🃗 🃖 🂧 🂶 🃆 🂦  Crib: 🃔 🃒 🂳 🃓 Odd card: 🂣" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="valign">Dealer:&mdash;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The pone leads a Seven, and afterwards pairs the dealer’s Six,
pegging to 58. The dealer pegs 6 for the pair royal, and is told
to go. This enables the dealer to make a double pair royal and
31, pegging fourteen holes more. (The last card does not count
when a go or 31 is pegged). On the show the pone has only a
pair, which puts him to 60, within one of the game hole. The
dealer shows 12 in hand and 17 in crib, making him 54 up. In
the next deal the player who wanted one could not peg, his adversary
securing a fifteen and a go, and showing out with a pair and
a fifteen, 61 up and game.</p>

<h4>THREE-HANDED CRIBBAGE.</h4>

<p>Five cards are dealt to each player, and then another, face down,
for the foundation of the crib. Each player then lays out one
card to make the dealer’s crib up to four. The starter is cut by
the player on the dealer’s left, and the game proceeds as at six-card
Cribbage, the eldest hand having the first show, the dealer
the last.</p>

<h4>FOUR-HANDED CRIBBAGE.</h4>

<p>When four play, they cut for partners, choice of seats, and deal;
the two lowest pairing against the two highest, and the lowest
taking the first deal and crib. The game is usually 121 points up,
or twice round the board, and only one player on each side keeps
the score.</p>

<p>Five cards are dealt to each player, one at a time, and one of
these is discarded from each hand to form the crib, leaving four
cards with which to play. The right-hand adversary of the dealer
cuts for deal; the left-hand adversary for the starter. The eldest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
hand plays first, and all pairs, sequences, and fifteens are scored
by the side making them. If a player says “go,” his left-hand
neighbour must play, or pass the go to the next player on his left.
In this way it may pass entirely round the table to the last player,
who will then peg for it.</p>

<p>At this game there is a great deal more in the play than in either
hand or crib. The average hand and crib is the same as at six-card
Cribbage, 7 for the hand and 5 for the crib, but the play
for the partners will run to 8 or 10 holes. Either side should be
at home with 48 to 50 on two deals; four individual hands of 7
each, four plays of five each, and one crib of 5.</p>

<h4>SEVEN-CARD CRIBBAGE.</h4>

<p>This form of the game for two players differs from the others only
in the number of cards dealt to each player, which is seven. Two
are laid out for the crib, and five kept for playing. There being
six cards in each hand, with the starter, the counting combinations
sometimes run into high figures, and it is therefore usual to play
the game 121 or even 181 points up.</p>

<h3>PIQUET.</h3>

<p>Piquet is supposed to have been introduced during the reign of
Charles VII., and was designed as a motif for a ballet of living
cards which was given in the palace of Chinon. Of the etymology
of the word piquet, little or nothing is known, but the game itself
is one of those perennials that have survived much more pretentious
rivals, and, thanks to its intrinsic merits, it has never since its invention
ceased to be more or less à la mode.</p>

<p>There are several varieties of Piquet, but the straightforward
game for two players, sometimes called <i><b>Piquet au Cent</b></i>, or 100
points up, is the most common and popular, and will be first described.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Piquet is played with a pack of thirty-two cards,
all below the Seven being deleted. The cards rank: A K Q J 10
9 8 7, the Ace being the highest both in cutting and in play.
There is no trump in Piquet, and all suits are equal in value. Two
packs are sometimes used, one by each player in his proper turn to
deal.</p>

<p>The cards have a certain pip-counting value, the Ace being
reckoned for 11, other court cards for 10 each, and the 7 8 9 10 for
their face value.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKERS.</b></i> As the scores are not put down until the end
of the hand or play the game is usually kept on a sheet of paper,
or it may be marked on a cribbage board.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Piquet is played by two persons, who sit opposite
each other. They are known as the dealer, and the elder
hand or pone.</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> They cut for seats and cards, the lower cut
having the choice, and dealing the first hand. If a player exposes
more than one card the lowest of those exposed must be taken as
his cut. Ties are decided by cutting a second time.</p>

<p><i><b>STAKES.</b></i> Piquet is played for so much a game of 100
points; but if the loser has not reached 50 points he is lurched,
and loses a double game.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> The cards shuffled, they are presented to the
pone to be cut, and at least two cards must be left in each packet.
Twelve cards are dealt to each player, either two or three at a
time; but whichever method is first selected must be maintained
throughout the game. In England the cards are always dealt by
twos. No trump is turned. The remaining eight cards are placed
face downward on the table, the five top cards being laid crosswise
on the three at the bottom. These eight cards are called the
<i><b>talon</b></i> or stock. Each player deals in turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in Dealing.</b></i> If the pack is proved to be
imperfect the deal is void, but all previous scores or cuts made
with that pack stand good. A misdeal does not lose the deal under
any circumstances. If a card is found faced in the pack there must
be a fresh deal with the same cards. If a player deals out of turn,
and detects the error himself before he sees any of his cards, he
may insist on his adversary’s dealing, even if the adversary has
seen his cards. As the deal is a disadvantage the adversary is not
bound to correct the player in error.</p>

<p>If the dealer gives too many or too few cards to either player a
new deal is at the option of the adversary. The error will of
course be detected when it is found that there are only seven cards
in the talon. If the non-dealer elects to have the deal stand, the
error in the player’s hand must be remedied in the discard, as will
presently be described, and the stock must be divided 4-3 or 5-2,
according to which player has too many cards.</p>

<p><i><b>Carte Blanche.</b></i> The cards dealt, each player takes up his
twelve cards and sorts them into suits. If the pone finds himself
without a K Q or J, he should immediately claim 10 points for
carte blanche. If the dealer holds carte blanche, he does not declare
it until the pone has discarded.</p>

<p><i><b>DISCARDING.</b></i> The five cards on the top of the talon belong
to the pone, and he may discard from his hand any number
of cards from one to five, and replace them by an equal number
from the top of the stock. He must take at least one card, and he
must take from the talon in the natural order of the cards. If he
has elected to let a deal stand in which he has been given thirteen
cards, he is entitled to four cards only from the talon, and must in
all cases leave himself with twelve cards after his discard and draw
are completed. If he does not take all five cards, he must announce
distinctly how many he leaves, for if he fails to do so the
dealer is not liable for having too many cards.</p>

<p>The dealer then discards, first declaring carte blanche if he holds
it. In England, he need not draw at all, in France he must draw
at least one card. Besides the three cards which belong to him,
he is entitled to take as many as he pleases of those left by the
pone, and in drawing from the talon he must take the cards in the
order in which they come. If two cards are left by the pone, for
instance, and the dealer wants three only, he must take the two
left by the pone and one of his own three, leaving the two others
face down on the table. The number of cards in hand after the
discard and draw must be exactly twelve. Only one discard is allowed,
and having been made it cannot be changed after the stock
has been touched.</p>

<p>If the pone does not take all the cards to which he is entitled, he
is allowed to look at those that remain of the first five that were on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
the talon; but on no account may he look at any of the dealer’s
three. If the dealer leaves any cards in the stock, he has
a right to look at them, but the pone may not see them until he
has led for the first trick, or announced the suit he will lead.
If he announces a suit, and after seeing the cards in the stock
does not lead that suit, the dealer may call a suit. If the dealer
does not look at the remaining cards the pone cannot see them
either.</p>

<p>Each player keeps his discards separate from those of his adversary,
and is allowed to refer to them at any time during the play
of the hand, but on no account can he see his adversary’s discards,
unless that adversary has mixed with them one or more of
the unseen cards that were left in the stock, and afterward picks
up and looks at his discard, including the card which the other is
entitled to see. For instance: The dealer leaves a card without
looking at it. This he afterward mixes with his discard. Now, if
he looks at his discard, of course he sees the card left in the stock,
and the pone may demand to see not only the card left, but the
entire discard. The same rule applies to the pone if he takes into
his discards an unseen card of the stock.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregular Discards.</b></i> If a player discards less cards than
he intended, it is too late to remedy the error if he has touched the
stock. If he discards too many cards, as the dealer frequently will
by laying out five instead of three, he may take them back if he has
not touched those in the stock, but if he touches any card in the
stock, he must play with the short hand if there are not enough
cards left in the stock to make his hand up to twelve.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregular Drawing.</b></i> If the pone draws one of the three
cards which properly belong to the dealer, he loses the game; and
if the dealer draws any of the first five, before the pone has announced
that he leaves them, the dealer loses the game. The
dealer has no right to touch any part of the stock until the pone
has discarded and drawn; but if the pone draws without making
any announcement about leaving cards, the dealer has a right to
assume that five cards have been taken, and that only three remain
in the stock. For instance: The pone discards five cards, but
draws four only, without saying anything. The dealer proceeds
to discard and draw. He has of course taken one of the pone’s
cards, but it is too late to remedy the error or claim a penalty, and
the pone must play with eleven cards. It is evident that the
dealer will have too many cards, but as he has been led into the
error by his adversary, he must be allowed to discard to reduce his
hand to twelve.</p>

<p>If a player takes a card too many from the stock, he may replace
it if he has not put it with the other cards in his hand. If he has
seen it, he must show it to his adversary. If the superfluous card
has been taken into the hand, the player must have too many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
cards, and can score nothing that deal. This does not prevent the
adversary from scoring anything he may have in hand or play,
even if it is inferior.</p>

<p>If a player is found to have too few cards after the draw, he may
still play and count all he can make, but he cannot win a capot,
because he has no card for the last trick, which must be won by
his adversary.</p>

<p><i><b>The Stock.</b></i> If a player looks at one of his adversary’s cards
in the stock before or during the draw, he can count nothing that
hand. If he looks at a card left in the talon after the draw, which
he is not entitled to see, his adversary may call a suit from him as
many times as he has seen cards. If a card of the talon is accidentally
exposed, the player to whom it would naturally belong
may demand a fresh deal.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> In order to understand the
principles that guide players in discarding, the objects of the game
must first be explained. There are three classes of counting combinations
at Piquet, and the player that holds the better of each
class, scores it. These combinations are: Point; Sequence;
Fours and Triplets.</p>

<p><i><b>The Point</b></i> is the suit having the greatest pip value, reckoning
the Ace as 11, court cards as 10 each, and the 10 9 8 7 at their
face value. If one player’s best suit contains five cards, worth 48
points, and his adversary has a suit worth 51, the latter would
be the only one to count, and it would be called the point for that
deal.</p>

<p>The value of the point is the number of cards that go to make
it. In England, they count a point containing the 7 8 and 9 as
worth one less than the number of cards. This is a modern invention,
unknown to the older writers on the game, and not always
played.</p>

<p><i><b>Sequence.</b></i> Three or more cards of the same suit, if next in
value to one another, form a sequence. The French terms are
generally used to designate the number of cards in the sequence:
Tierce, Quatrième, Quinte, Sixième, Septième, Huitième. Many
English works on cards erroneously spell quinte without the “e,”
and give “quart” for a sequence of four. If one is going to use
the French language at all, it may as well be used correctly.</p>

<p>Sequences outrank one another according to the best card, if
they are of equal length; so that a quinte to a King would be
better than a quinte to a Queen; but a longer sequence always
outranks a shorter one, regardless of the high cards. The player
holding the best sequence is entitled to score it, together with any
inferior sequences he may hold in other suits. Should his adversary
hold intermediate sequences, they are of no value. For instance:
One player holds a quinte to the Jack in spades, a tierce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
to the Ten in hearts, and a tierce to the Nine in clubs; while the
other holds a quatrième majeure (A K Q J) in hearts, diamonds,
and clubs. None of the latter are of any value; but all those in
the other hand are good. If the best sequence is a tie, no sequences
can be scored by either player.</p>

<p>The value of a sequence is ten more than the number of cards
that go to form it, provided that number exceeds four. A tierce
counts 3 only, and a quatrième 4 only; but a quinte is worth 15, a
sixième 16, and so on.</p>

<p><i><b>Fours, and Triplets.</b></i> Any four cards of the same denomination,
higher than a Nine, is called a Quatorze; three of any kind
higher than the Nine is called a Trio, or sometimes a Brelan. As
a trio is seldom mentioned without naming the denomination, it is
usual to say; “Three Kings,” or “Three Jacks,” as the case may
be. The 7 8 and 9 have no value except in point and sequence.
The player holding the quatorze of the highest rank may score any
inferior ones that he may hold, and also any trios. Should his
adversary hold any intermediate ones, they are of no value. In
the absence of any quatorze, the best trio decides which player
shall count all the trios he may have in his hand, his adversary
counting none. For instance: One player holds four Tens and
three Jacks, his adversary holding triplets of Aces, Kings, and
Queens. None of the latter would be of any value, as the lowest
quatorze is better than the highest trio, and the player with
the four Tens could count his three Jacks also. Pairs have no
value.</p>

<p>The value of any quatorze is 14, as its name implies. Trios are
worth 3 only.</p>

<p>In discarding, the object is to secure the best counting combinations,
and also to retain cards which will win tricks in play. The
combinations take precedence of one another in scoring, the first
being always Carte Blanche, then the Point, then Sequence, and
lastly the Quatorze or Trio.</p>

<p><i><b>DECLARING.</b></i> Carte blanche must be announced and
shown before a discard is made. Each player having discarded
and drawn, the elder hand proceeds to announce any counting
combinations he holds, which he must declare in regular order,
beginning with the point. In announcing the point, the suit is not
mentioned, only its value. The sequences are defined by the number
of cards and the highest; “sixième to the King,” for instance.
The fours and trios are defined in the same way; “four Kings,” or
“three Jacks.”</p>

<p>To each of these declarations, as they are made in regular order,
the dealer must reply: “<i><b>Good</b></i>,” “<i><b>Equal</b></i>,” or, “<i><b>Not good</b></i>.”
If the point is admitted to be good, the holder scores it; not by
putting it down on the score sheet, but simply by beginning his
count with the number of points it is worth. If the point is equal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
neither player scores it, and secondary points have no value under
any circumstances. If the point declared by the elder hand is not
good, it is not necessary for the dealer to say how much better his
point is; that will come later. To each of the other declarations
replies are made in the same manner, except that fours and trios
cannot be “equal.” As each combination is admitted to be good,
the elder hand adds it to his count. For instance: His point is 51,
good; his sequence is five to the Ace, good; and his triplet of
Aces is good. These are worth 5, 15, and 3 respectively, and his
total count is 23, if he has no minor sequences or trios. This is
not put down, but simply announced.</p>

<p>The strict rules of the game require the player whose combination
is acknowledged to be good, to show it; but among good
players this is quite unnecessary, for each usually knows by his own
cards what his adversary should and probably does hold.</p>

<p>The elder hand having finished his declarations, and announced
their total value in points, leads any card he pleases. If this card
is a Ten or better, he claims one point for leading it, even if he
does not win the trick, and he adds this point to his score.</p>

<p>An illustration will probably make the foregoing processes
clearer. The elder hand, after the draw, holds these cards:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Cards">
  <tr>
    <td>♡ A K Q J:</td>
    <td>♣ A K Q:</td>
    <td>♢ A K Q 7:</td>
    <td>♠ A.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>He announces: “Forty-one.” “Not good.” “Quatrième to the
Ace.” “Not good.” “Quatorze Aces,” which he knows is good;
and which admits of his counting his triplets of Kings and Queens.
These are worth collectively 20 points, and on leading one of his
Aces he announces “Twenty-one.”</p>

<p>The dealer, before playing a card, proceeds to claim the count
for the combinations which are good in his own hand, which is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Cards">
  <tr>
    <td>♣ J 10 9 8:</td>
    <td>♢ J 10 9:</td>
    <td>♠ K Q J 10 9.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The point is worth 5; the quinte 15, the quatrième 4, and the
tierce 3; 27 altogether. His trios of Jacks and Tens are shut out
by the superior combinations in the elder hand.</p>

<p>Having claimed these 27 points, and their correctness having
been admitted by the elder hand, the dealer proceeds to play a
card. If either player has forgotten to declare anything before he
plays, the count is lost.</p>

<p><i><b>Sinking.</b></i> A player is not obliged to declare any combination
unless he wishes to do so, and he may sink a card if he thinks it
would be to his advantage to conceal his hand. Sinking is calling
only part of a combination, as, for instance, calling 51 for his point
when he really has 61; calling a quinte when he has a sixième, or
a trio when he has a quatorze. Sinking is usually resorted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
only when the player knows from his own hand and discards that
what he declares is still better than anything his adversary can
hold; but it must be remembered that the part of the declaration
which is sunk in this manner is lost.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregular Declarations.</b></i> If either player claims a combination
which he does not hold, and does not remedy the error before
he plays a card, he cannot count anything that deal, losing any
other declarations he may have made which are correct. His adversary
then counts everything in his hand, whether his combinations
were inferior or not. He also counts for what he wins in the
tricks.</p>

<p>If the elder hand’s declaration is admitted by the dealer to be
good, it is good, even if the dealer afterward proves to have a better
point, sequence, quatorze or trio. If any combination named
by the elder hand is not actually his best, he cannot amend his
declaration after the dealer has replied to it. This is in order to
prevent a player from getting information to which he is not entitled.
If he holds three Kings and three Tens, for instance,
and announces the Tens in order to find out whether or not his
adversary has three Queens or Jacks, and the dealer says: “Not
good,” the three Kings are lost, and the dealer scores his own
trios.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that in order to keep a good point or sequence,
a player will discard one card of a quatorze originally
dealt him; or one of a trio, of which he afterward draws the
fourth. He can score only the trio, of course; but his adversary,
having none of that denomination either in his hand or discards,
knows that four were possible, and after playing a card he has a
right to ask the suit of the card which was discarded.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The elder hand can lead
any card he pleases, announcing the suit at the same time. The
dealer is bound to follow suit, if able, but he is not obliged to win
the trick. As there are no trumps, the higher card, if of the suit
led, wins the trick. If the second player does not follow suit,
the leader wins. The winner of one trick leads for the next, and
so on until all twelve tricks are played.</p>

<p>Every time a card is played which is better than a Nine, the
leader counts one for it, adding the number to the total value of
his score as already announced. If the second player wins the
trick with any card better than a Nine he also counts one; but if
the trick is won by the player who led, there is no extra count for
winning it. The winner of the <i><b>last trick</b></i> counts one for it, in
addition to his count for winning it with a card better than a Nine.
If the leader wins it, he gets the one extra.</p>

<p>If each player wins six tricks, there is no further scoring; but if
either player wins the <i><b>odd trick</b></i> he adds to his score ten points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
for <i><b>cards</b></i>, in addition to all other scores. If either player wins
all twelve tricks, which would be the case in the example hand
just given as an illustration, he adds to his score forty points for
the <i><b>capot</b></i>; but this forty points includes the scores for the last
trick and for the odd trick.</p>

<p>A card once laid on the table cannot be taken back, unless the
player has renounced in error. There is no <i><b>revoke</b></i> in Piquet,
and if a player has one of the suit led he must play it. If he fails
to do so, when the error is discovered the cards must be taken
back and replayed.</p>

<p><i><b>REPIC.</b></i> If either player is able to reach 30 by successive
declarations, beginning with the point, all of which are admitted
by his adversary to be good, he adds 60 to his score, making it 90
instead of 30, and this is irrespective of what his adversary may
have in minor or inferior combinations. The important thing to
remember in repic is that declarations always count in regular
order, carte blanche taking precedence of everything; then the
point, sequences, and quatorze or trio. Suppose elder hand to
hold the following cards:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Cards">
  <tr>
    <td>♡ K Q J 10 9;</td>
    <td>♣ A K Q;</td>
    <td>♢ A Q 9;</td>
    <td>♠ Q.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If the quinte to the King is admitted good for the point, it must
be good for the sequence also. That is 20. The four Queens
must be good, as the adversary cannot have any quatorze. This
makes the total 34, and 60 added for repic, 94 altogether, to which
he will add one for leading the first card, if it is above a Nine.</p>

<p>Suppose the elder hand had the following cards:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Cards">
  <tr>
    <td>♡ A K Q J 8;</td>
    <td>♣ A K;</td>
    <td>♢ A K;</td>
    <td>♠ A K 10.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If his point is good, that and his four Aces and Kings will make
him 33 altogether; but his sequence is not good, because the
dealer holds five diamonds to the Queen, which comes in order
before the score for quatorze, and so saves the repic. Suppose
that with the foregoing cards the elder hand was told that even
his point was not good. He would count 29 for the 14 Aces, 14
Kings, and the card led. If the dealer had a sixième in diamonds,
and a quinte in clubs, for instance, he would claim a repic, 96
points, in spite of the 29 announced by the elder hand; because
point and sequence score before quatorze.</p>

<p>Equalities do not save the repic. Take the following hands:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Cards">
  <tr>
    <td>Elder:&mdash;</td>
    <td>♡ A J 10 9 8;</td>
    <td>♣ 10;</td>
    <td>♢ 10;</td>
    <td>♠ A J 10 9 8.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dealer:&mdash;</td>
    <td>♡ K Q;</td>
    <td>♣ A K Q;</td>
    <td>♢ A K Q J 7;</td>
    <td>♠ K Q.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The point is equal. The quatrième to the Jack is not good
and the four Tens are not good; so elder hand leads a card, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
counts, “One.” The dealer then claims repic, 95 points, which is
good, although the elder hand had an equal point.</p>

<p><i><b>PIC.</b></i> If either player can reach 30 in hand and play combined,
before his adversary scores anything, 30 are added for the pic.
Pic can never be made by the dealer unless the elder hand leads a
card smaller than a Nine; he must make repic if anything. To
make pic the elder hand must reach 30 in the regular order of
scoring. Suppose holds these cards:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Cards">
  <tr>
    <td>♡ A 9;</td>
    <td>♣ A K Q J;</td>
    <td>♢ K Q J 10 9;</td>
    <td>♠ K.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If the dealer acknowledges the point to be good, everything else
in the hand must be good also. This will give the elder hand 27
before playing a card; 5 for the point, 15 and 4 for the sequences,
and 3 for the Kings. By leading out the A K and Q, 3 more
points are secured, the dealer having nothing to score, and so the
elder hand reaches 30 and makes the pic, counting 60, and still
having the lead. Equalities do not save pic.</p>

<p>According to the strict rules of the game, a player who is playing
for pic is not allowed to count 30 at all, but must jump from
his last count, 29, to 60, or he loses the pic; but this is seldom
or never insisted on.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> The last card played, the total number of points
made by each player are put down on the score sheet, or marked
on a cribbage board, and if neither player has reached 100 points,
the deal passes to the one who was elder hand on the last deal.</p>

<p>The order of scoring should be carefully observed, in order to
determine which goes out first, and whether or not a player is
lurched. Carte blanche, The Point, Sequence, Quatorze or Trio,
Repic, Points for Leading or Winning, Pic, the Odd Trick, Capot.</p>

<p>If one player reaches 100 before his adversary has reached 50, it
is a <i><b>lurch</b></i>, and counts a double game.</p>

<p><i><b>Abandoned Hands.</b></i> If a player throws down his cards, he
may still take them up again, unless he or his adversary have
mixed their cards with the discards, or with the remainder of the
talon.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> The chief
points for the beginner are good discarding, and taking advantage
of tenace positions in the play, so as to secure the count for cards,
which is often important.</p>

<p><i><b>Elder Hand.</b></i> In discarding, the pone should consider what
there may be against him. If it is unlikely that he will lose a pic
or repic, he should try for the <i><b>point</b></i>, which very often carries
with it the sequence. It must be remembered that there are only
eight cards in each suit, and by comparing those that you hold with
those that your adversary may hold it is comparatively easy, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
majority of hands, to estimate the possible scores against you.
Next to the point, the most important thing is the score for
<i><b>cards</b></i>. The point will save pic and repic, but the cards will make
the greatest difference in the score in the long run. Sequences are
always valuable, especially those that are Ace high in the elder
hand, because they enable him to win a succession of tricks in
play.</p>

<p>The elder hand should risk a good deal if he has a fair chance
to make a pic or repic, which will often settle the game. If there
is any choice as to what to keep of two nearly equal chances,
always preserve the combination that will be most likely to secure
the count for cards.</p>

<p>In <i><b>Leading</b></i>, it is best to begin with the point, unless you
know that you are leading up to tenace, or to high cards that will
bring in a long adverse suit. The piquet player soon learns the
importance of tenace and fourchette, and can sometimes see how
things must be managed for five or six tricks ahead, so as to secure
the odd trick. Tenace is the best and third-best of any suit, such
as A Q, while a fourchette is any two cards within one of each
other, such as K J, or Q 10, and the lead from such combinations
should always be avoided. If you have the odd trick in hand,
make it at once, before you risk anything else, because the only
difference between the odd trick and eleven tricks is the count for
each card led in the tricks.</p>

<p><i><b>The Dealer.</b></i> The first thing to guard against is a long run
of winning leads from the elder hand, which might make the odd
trick, or even capot. As there are no trumps it is very important
for the dealer to keep guarded Kings and twice-guarded Queens.
The principal thing for the dealer to remember is that if he cannot
stop a long suit in the elder hand, he will have to provide in advance
for a certain number of discards, and these must be so
planned that guards will be preserved in the other suits. He
should also get his hand into such condition that when he does
get into the lead, he will not have to lead away from tenaces or
guarded Kings. Careful attention to his adversary’s declarations,
and a comparison of his own hand with his discards will usually
guide the dealer to a correct conclusion as to what to keep and
what to throw away in playing to tricks.</p>

<p>Mathematicians have exhausted their resources on Piquet, but
their conclusions are of little use to the average player. The subject
of discards has been very fully illustrated by examples from
actual play, especially in the <i>Westminster Papers</i>, but no one has
yet given us any simple rules like the jeux de règle at Écarté.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<h4>PIQUET NORMAND, FOR THREE PLAYERS.</h4>

<p>In this form of the game the players cut for seats and deal.
The cards are dealt by twos and threes until each has ten, two
cards remaining for the talon. The dealer may lay out any two
cards in exchange for these, but no other player is allowed to
touch them, nor to see the discards.</p>

<p>The elder hand makes the first declarations. He makes repic
and counts 90 if he can reach 20 without playing a card; and he
makes pic, 60, if he can reach 20 in hand and play, under the same
conditions as in the game for two players. The majority of tricks
counts 10; if it is a tie, each counts 5. Capot counts 40 if all the
tricks are taken by one player; but if two take them all between
them, they count 20 each.</p>

<p>The game may be played for a pool, first man out to take all;
or it may be agreed that after one has retired the others shall decide
it between them by playing it out at the ordinary two-handed
game.</p>

<h4>PIQUET VOLEUR, FOR FOUR PLAYERS.</h4>

<p>The players cut for partners, the two lowest pairing against the
two highest, and the lowest cut taking the first deal. Partners sit
opposite each other. All the cards are dealt out, two and three at a
time, each receiving eight cards.</p>

<p>The elder hand declares first, but instead of announcing one
thing at a time, and awaiting the reply of his adversaries, he declares
everything, and then plays a card. Suppose the cards are
distributed as follows, Z being the dealer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/p473.jpg" width="450" height="200" alt="Diagram of the distribution of the cards" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p>A announces 41 for his point, sequence of three to the Queen,
four Aces, and says, “I play a club,” which is his lead for the
first trick. If the second player admits all these to be good he
says nothing, but plays a card. In this case, Y would announce
four to the King, and four to the Jack, and would play a spade,
having no club. B would then announce three Kings, which are
good on account of his partner’s having four Aces; but both the
sequences are shut out by Y’s better declarations. The dealer, Z,
then declares four to the Ten and three to the Nine, both those
sequences being made good by his partner’s holding the best sequence
at the table.</p>

<p>The first trick played, each person at the table shows what he
has claimed, in order that his adversaries may verify the count.
A would then gather up the first trick, announcing the total score
for his side, which would be 22; 4 for the point, 14 Aces, 3 Kings,
and 1 for the card led. He would then play another club, announcing
22. This his partner would win but would not count,
as he is on the same side that has already counted for the lead.
If the play is followed up it will be found that A-B make a capot.
The adversaries will then score 15 for their three sequences of four,
and one of three.</p>

<p>No point of less than 30 can be announced.</p>

<p><i><b>Pic and Repic.</b></i> If one player, or two partners together,
reach 20 in counting, without playing, they count 90 for the repic.
If they reach 20 in declarations and play together, they count 60
for the pic. Carte blanche in the hand of one or other partner
may count toward pic or repic; and if two partners each held carte
blanche, they would be entitled to 90 points for the repic, no
matter what the adversaries held, because carte blanche takes precedence
of all other scores.</p>

<h4>PIQUET A ÉCRIRE.</h4>

<p>This game somewhat resembles Skat in the manner of playing
and settling. Any number from three to seven persons sit around
the table; but only two play, and the losses of each individual are
charged to him on a score sheet ruled off for the purpose. The
players may take turns, each playing two deals, the first with the
person on his left, and the second with the one on his right. Or
it may be agreed that the loser in each deal shall give way to a
new player, the winner of the majority of points in each deal to
continue. The game is generally arranged for a certain number
of tours or deals, at the end of which the scores are balanced and
settled for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span></p>

<h4>RUBICON PIQUET, FOR TWO PLAYERS.</h4>

<p>The chief difference between this game and the usual form,
Piquet au cent, is in the manner of declaring. The usual method
in England and America is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i><b>The Point</b></i> is scored by the player holding the greatest number
of cards in the suit, and the pip value is resorted to only to decide
ties. This is done in order to conceal, if possible, the nature of
the cards held. When the numerical value is asked, only the last
figure is given, “seven,” for instance, if the point is 47.</p>

<p>If the point is good, the elder hand immediately names the suit.
If it is not good, the suit is not named, and the elder hand proceeds
to call his <i><b>sequences</b></i>. It they are good, the suits must be
named; the same with quatorze and trio.</p>

<p><i><b>Under-calling.</b></i> If a player holds an inferior sequence,
quatorze or trio, which he knows is better than any his adversary
can possibly hold, he may call it, and afterward score the better
combination, provided he is correct in estimating the inferior one
that he called as <i><b>good against the cards</b></i>. But if the adversary
can demonstrate that the inferior announcement was not
actually good against the cards, and that it was possible for him to
hold a better, the score for the higher combination is lost. For
instance: A player holds four Kings and three Aces, and on glancing
over his hand and discards, sees that his adversary cannot hold
any quatorze, so he declares the three Kings, instead of the four
Aces. Suppose he mistook a Nine for a Ten, and overlooked the
fact that his adversary might have had four Tens, the score for the
four Kings would be lost, but the three Aces would be good if his
adversary had discarded a Ten, and did not actually hold four.
In the ordinary game, the higher combination is lost if it is not
called.</p>

<p>In play, every card led, whatever its value, counts one, and winning
the trick counts one also. The last trick counts two, and the
capot forty. Pic and repic are reckoned as in the ordinary game.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> Instead of playing 100 points up, six deals is a game,
each player dealing three times. The lower score is then deducted
from the higher, and 100 points added to the difference to determine
the value of the game, which is usually played for so much a
point.</p>

<p>If the result of the six deals is a tie, two more deals must be
played. If they also result in a tie, the game is void.</p>

<p><i><b>Rubicons.</b></i> If either or both players fail to reach 100 points in
the six deals, the one having the most is the winner, and adds to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
his own score all the points made by the loser, with 100 in addition
for game. For instance: A has 113 scored, and B 80. A wins
113 + 80 + 100 = 293 altogether. Again; A has 88, B has 84.
A wins 88 + 84 + 100 = 272 altogether. Again; A has 180, B
has 142. A wins the difference in the scores, 38 + 100 = 138 altogether.</p>

<h3>IMPERIAL, OR PIQUET WITH A TRUMP.</h3>

<p>Impérial differs from Piquet in some minor details, although the
leading principle is the same. There are no discards; sequences
of court cards are the only ones that count; tierces are worthless;
and a trump suit is added.</p>

<p>The <i><b>cards</b></i> rank K Q J A 10 9 8 7; the K Q J A and 7 of
trumps are called honours, and in all sequences the four highest
cards in the suit are the only ones that count.</p>

<p><i><b>Counters.</b></i> Each player is supplied with six white and four
red counters, which are passed from left to right as the points
accrue. Each red is worth six white, and when all six white
counters have been passed over, they must be returned, and a red
one passed over in their place. When all the counters, four red
and six white, have been passed over, the game is won.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> Twelve cards are given to each player, two or three
at a time, and the twenty-fifth is turned up for the trump. If this
is an honour, the dealer marks one white counter for it. There
are no discards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Impérials.</b></i> Certain combinations of cards are known as impérials,
and the player marks one red counter for each of them.
The best impérial is carte blanche, which is sometimes marked as
a double impérial, and worth two reds. A sequence of K Q J A
in any suit is an impérial. An impérial de retourne may be
formed in the dealer’s hand if the turn-up trump completes his
sequence or makes four of a kind. An impérial tombée, or de
rencontre, is made when the player who holds the King and Queen
of trumps catches the Jack and Ace from his adversary. Four
Kings, Queens, Jacks, Aces, or Sevens in one hand is an impérial;
but the Eights, Nines and Tens have no value.</p>

<p><i><b>Declaring.</b></i> The elder hand announces his point, as in Piquet,
and arrives at its value in the same way, reckoning the Ace for 11,
etc. The dealer replies, “Good,” or “Not good,” as the case
may be; but there are no equalities. If the point is a tie, the
elder hand counts it. The point is worth a <i><b>white</b></i> counter. The
impérials are then called, each being worth one <i><b>red</b></i> counter. The
sequences are called first, that in trumps being “good” of course;
then the fours are called, the best being four Kings, and the
lowest four Aces. In plain-suit sequences there are no “equals,”
the elder hand counting ties as an offset to the advantages of the
deal.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing.</b></i> The elder hand leads a card, and the dealer then
declares and marks any impérials he may have that are good; after
which he plays a card. No impérials can be claimed or scored
after the holder has played a card. The second player in each
trick must win the trick if he can, either with a higher card or with
a trump. For each honour in trumps in the tricks won the player
marks a white counter at the end of the hand. The winner of the
odd trick scores as many white counters as he has tricks in excess
of his adversary. If either player makes capot, (all twelve tricks,)
he scores two red counters.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> When one player reaches six white counters and
changes them for a red, his adversary must take down any white
counters he may have scored. For instance: The pone has 2 reds
and 4 whites up; the dealer has 1 red and 5 whites. The pone
scores two whites, reaching six, and advancing his score to 3 reds,
which are sometimes called impérials. The dealer must take
down his white counters, losing that count altogether, and leaving
himself 1 red. The only exception to this is that at the beginning
of the hand if both have impérials combinations in hand, neither
side takes down its white counters.</p>

<p>In <i><b>Counting out</b></i> the following order of precedence must be observed:
The turn-up trump, (if it is an honour). The Point. Impérial
in hand, sequences first. Impérial de retourne. Impérial
tombée. Honours in tricks. Odd tricks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span></p>

<h3>CASSINO.</h3>

<p>This is a very old and always popular game, which has lately
been much improved by the introduction of the variations known
as Royal and Spade Cassino, the latter especially being a very
lively game. Like Euchre, Cassino is eminently respectable, and
is one of the few games of cards that are unhesitatingly admitted
to the domestic circle.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards.</b></i> Cassino is played with a full pack of fifty-two cards,
which have no rank in play, their pip or face value being the only
element of importance. In cutting for positions at the table, or
for partners in the four-handed game, the Ace is the lowest card,
the others ranking upward to the King in the order of their sequence.</p>

<p><i><b>Markers.</b></i> When a certain number of points is agreed on as a
game, the score may be kept with counters, on a sheet of paper,
or on a cribbage board. If each hand is a game in itself, it is
settled for immediately, either in counters or in money.</p>

<p><i><b>Players.</b></i> Any number from two to four may play, each for
himself, or four may play two against two, partners sitting opposite
each other. The players on the dealer’s right and left are known
as the pone, and the eldest hand respectively.</p>

<p><i><b>Cutting.</b></i> The players draw from an outspread pack for positions
at the table, the lowest card having the choice and dealing
the first hand. If the first cut does not decide, those tying must
cut again. If a player exposes more than one card he must cut
again. The ace is low.</p>

<p><i><b>Stakes.</b></i> Cassino may be played for so much a game, or so
much a point; and it may be agreed that the game shall be a
certain number of points, or shall be complete in one deal, or that
the player making the majority of points on each deal shall score
one, and the one first making a certain number in this manner,
such as five, shall be the winner. If points are played for, the
lower score is usually deducted from the higher, and the difference
is the value of the game. It is sometimes agreed that if the winner
has twice as many points as his adversary, he shall be paid for
a double game.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> After the cards have been properly shuffled they
must be presented to the pone to be cut, and he must leave at
least four in each packet. Beginning on his left, the dealer distributes
four cards to each player in two rounds of two at a time,
giving two to the table just before helping himself in each round.
No trump is turned, and the remainder of the pack is left face
downward on the dealer’s left. The four cards dealt to the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
are then turned face up, and the play begins. After the four cards
given to each person have all been played, the dealer takes up
the remainder of the pack, and without any further shuffling or
cutting, deals four more cards to each player, two at a time, but
gives none to the table. These four having been played, four more
are dealt in the same manner, and so on, until the pack is exhausted,
after which the deal passes to the left in regular rotation.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in the Deal.</b></i> If the pack is proved to be imperfect,
or if a card is found faced in the pack there must be a fresh
deal by the same dealer. If a player deals out of turn, he must
be stopped before the cards on the table are turned face upward.</p>

<p>A misdeal loses the deal. It is a misdeal if the pack has not been
cut, or if the cards are shuffled after the pack has been properly
cut; or if the dealer deals a card incorrectly, and fails to remedy
it before dealing to the next player; or if he deals too many or too
few cards to any player or to the table.</p>

<p>If a card is exposed during the deal, an adversary may claim a
fresh deal. If, after the cards on the table have been faced, a
card is exposed by the dealer, or is found faced in the pack, the
player to whom it would be dealt may reject it, and it must then be
placed in the middle of the stock, and he must be given the top
card. If a card is exposed in the last round, the dealer must take
it, and must allow the player to whom it would have been dealt to
draw a card from the dealer’s hand, face downward. If he draws
the exposed card, he must keep it.</p>

<p>If the dealer gives any player an incorrect number of cards in
any round after the first, and does not detect and correct the error
before he deals to the next player, the dealer cannot count anything
that hand. The number of cards in each hand must be restored
to four, either by drawing from them, face down, or adding
from the stock. If any player lifts his cards before the dealer has
helped all the players, including himself, a misdeal cannot be
claimed.</p>

<p><i><b>Objects of the Game.</b></i> The object in Cassino is to secure
certain cards and combinations of cards which count toward game.

<p>The manner in which these points are secured will become apparent
from the description of the method of playing the hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Method of Playing.</b></i> Beginning on the dealer’s left, each
player in turn plays a card from his hand, placing it face upward
on the table. Only one card can be played at a time, and each
person must play in his proper turn until all four of his cards are
exhausted. After receiving fresh cards, the eldest hand again
plays first, and so on for every round. Under certain conditions,
each player in his proper turn may take up certain cards from the
table, together with the one played from his hand, turning them
face downward in front of him. He is entitled to count all the
points contained in the cards taken in or won in this manner.
These conditions are: that he can match or <i><b>pair</b></i> a card or cards
on the table; that he can <i><b>combine</b></i> two or more cards on the
table so as to make their total pip value equal to that of the card
he plays; or that he can <i><b>build</b></i> a card in his hand upon one on
the table, so as to make their total pip value agree with that of a
second card, still in his hand.</p>

<p><i><b>Pairing.</b></i> If the person whose turn it is to play, holds in his
hand any card of a similar denomination to any of those on the
table, he may play the card from his hand, face upward, and then
gather it in again, together with all similar cards, turning them
face downward in front of him. For instance: He holds an
Eight, and there are one or two Eights on the table. He plays the
Eight from his hand, and then gathers in all of them.</p>

<p><i><b>Combining.</b></i> If a player holds any card, not a K Q or J, the
pip value of which is equal to that of two or more cards on the
table, he may play the card from his hand, and then gather it in
again, together with the two or three cards that collectively equal it
in pip value. For instance: He holds a 9, and a 4, 3 and 2 are
upon the table. He may combine these three cards, calling attention
to the fact that their collective value is 9, and then play the 9
from his own hand, gathering in and turning down all four cards.
An 8 and Ace, or 6 and 3 might be gathered in the same way; or
two such combinations might be gathered at the same time, 3, 2,
6, 7, for instance, which would make two nines; all of which
might be gathered by a player holding a 9 his hand.</p>

<p>Pairs and combinations may be taken in together. For instance:
Among the cards on the table are a 4, 6, and 10, and the
player holds a 10. He can gather in not only the pair of Tens,
but the combinations which equal a 10.</p>

<p><i><b>Building.</b></i> A player may have in his hand two cards, the
lower of which, if added to a card on the table, would build up its
value to that of the higher card still in the player’s hand. For
instance: A player holds a 9 and 2, and there is a 7 on the table.
He may place the 2 on the 7, announcing the total value;
“Nine,” which will notify other players that those two cards cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
be separated; but he cannot take them in until it again comes
round to his turn to play, because he is allowed to play only one
card at a time, and he has played his card in making the build.</p>

<p>Should any other player following him hold a 9, he would be
entitled to take in this build, but he could not separate the two
cards forming it. A player holding either a 7 or a 2 could not
touch either of the cards in the build, because they are no longer
a 7 and 2, but a 9, for all practical purposes.</p>

<p><i><b>Increasing Builds.</b></i> If any player held an Ace and a 10 in
his hand, he could increase the 9 build to a 10 build, by putting his
Ace on the 7 and 2, and announcing the total value, “Ten.” Any
following player would then be unable to win the build with anything
but a 10, and the player who originally built it a 9 would
lose it unless he also held a 10 in his hand. Should the build
remain a 9 until it came round again to the player who originally
built it, he could then take it in with his 9, or he might himself increase
it to 10, if he had an Ace and a 10 in his hand; but in order
to do this the player must have in his hand the cards to win both
the original and the increased builds. A player holding in his
hand a 10, 3 and 2, but no 8, could not build a 5 on the table to
an 8, and afterward advance it to 10. He must have the 2 3 8
and 10 all in his own hand to do this.</p>

<p>Some players imagine that a player cannot increase his own
build in this manner, even if he has both the cards for the first
and last build; but there is no reason why a player should be
denied a privilege which is freely granted to his adversary. If
any player can legitimately make or increase a build, all may do
so, provided they have the proper cards.</p>

<p><i><b>Double Builds.</b></i> When two cards of the same denomination,
or two builds of the same value are put together as one, they
cannot be increased. For instance: A player holds 7 and 3, and
there are upon the table a 5 2 and 4. He places his 3 on the 4,
and gathers the 5 and 2 together, announcing the build as “Two
Sevens.” This cannot be increased to 8, 9, or 10 under any circumstances,
and nothing but a 7 will win it.</p>

<p>Pairs may be doubled in the same manner. If a player has two
Nines in his hand, and there is one on the table, he may build on
the latter with one of his own, announcing, “Two Nines,” which
will prevent any player from building either of them to 10, and
will entitle the builder to take in both cards with his third Nine
when it comes round to his turn. Should any other player at the
table hold the fourth Nine, he could of course take in the build.</p>

<p>It is necessary to distinguish between building and combining.
In combining cards, those already on the table are gathered together;
in building, or increasing a build, a card must be played
from the hand. If one player has made a build of any description,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
it cannot be interfered with or increased except by other cards
from a player’s hand, those from the table not being available.
For instance: One player has built a 5 by combining two Aces on
the table with a 3 from his hand. On the table are also a 2 and 4
and a following player holds a 9 and 7. He cannot use the deuce
on the table to increase the build from 5 to 7, nor the 4 to increase
it to 9; because that would not be building from his hand; but if
he held the 4 and 9 in his hand, he could build on the 5.</p>

<p>The simple rule to be remembered is that no combination of
cards once announced, and left on the table, can be changed, except
by the addition of a card from the hand of some player.</p>

<p><i><b>Taking In.</b></i> Any player who has made a build is obliged
either to win it, when it is next his turn to play, or to win something
else, or to make another build. For instance: He has built
a 5 into a 9 with a 4, and holds another 4; if another 5 appears on
the table before it comes to his turn to play, he may build that into
a 9 also, with his other 4, announcing, “Two Nines.” Or if some
player should lay out a 4 he could pair it and take it in, leaving
his 9 build until the next round. In the same way a player
may increase or win another player’s build instead of taking in his
own. An opponent’s build may be increased by cards from the
hand only.</p>

<p>In the four-handed game, partners may take in one another’s
builds, or may make builds which can be won by the card declared
in the partner’s hand. For instance; One player builds an 8, and
his partner holds Little Cassino. If there is a 6 on the table, the
Cassino can be built on it, and “two Eights,” called, although the
player has no 8 in his own hand; the 8 already built by his partner
is sufficient. If a player has built a 9 which has been taken
in by an adversary, he still holding the 9 he built for, his partner
may build for the declared 9 in the same way.</p>

<p><i><b>Sweeping.</b></i> If at any time a player is able to win everything
on the table with one card, it is a sweep, and counts a point. For
instance: He holds an 8, and there are upon the table four cards
only:&mdash;5 3 6 and 2. By combining the 6 and 2, and the 5 and 3,
two Eights will be formed, and the sweep is made. Sweeps are
usually marked by leaving the cards with which they are made
face upward at the bottom of the tricks taken in by the player.
Sweeps made by opposite sides are sometimes turned down to
cancel one another.</p>

<p><i><b>Trailing.</b></i> When a player cannot pair, combine, or build anything,
he must play a card. This is called trailing, because he is
simply following along waiting for opportunities. In trailing it is
usually the best policy to play the smaller cards, except Aces and
Little Cassino, because as other players will probably trail small
cards also, these may be combined and won with the larger cards
kept in the player’s hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Last Cards.</b></i> In the last round, all the cards remaining on
the table are won by the player who takes the last trick, but it
does not count as a sweep unless it would have been a sweep under
any circumstances. The last trick is usually made by the
dealer, who always keeps back a court card if he has one, to pair
one already on the table.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in Play.</b></i> If any person plays out of his
proper turn, the card so played is laid aside as exposed, until it
comes to his turn, when it is simply placed on the table with the
others. The player in error is not allowed to build or combine it,
nor to win anything with it.</p>

<p>If a player gathers in a card which does not belong to the combination
or build, he must not only return the card improperly
taken up, but all others taken in with it, together with his own
card, the latter, however, being laid out separately from the others.
If the combination was his own build, it must be broken up; if an
adversary’s, it must be restored, and left as it was.</p>

<p>If a player takes in a build with a wrong card, or takes in a wrong
combination, or gathers cards to which he is not entitled, the error
must be challenged and proved before the next trick is taken in by
another player, because only the last trick gathered can be seen.</p>

<p>If a player makes a build without the proper card in his hand to
win it, on discovery of the error, the combination must be broken
up, and the adversaries may take back the cards they have played
in following the erroneous build, and may amend their play. If,
however, another player has won the erroneous build, there is no
penalty, nor any remedy.</p>

<p><i><b>Showing.</b></i> After the last card has been played, each player
counts his cards face downward, and announces the number. The
player having the majority scores the three points for cards. If it
is a tie, neither scores. The cards are then turned face up, and
the spades counted and claimed; and then all the points for Cassinos
and Aces. It should be remembered that the total number
of points to be made in each hand, exclusive of sweeps, is eleven,
and the total of the claims made must agree with that number.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> There are several methods of scoring. The old
way was to play 11 points up, deducting the lower score from the
higher at the end of each deal. If one side reached 11 before the
adversary reached 6, it was a lurch, and counted as a double
game. The common method is to count every hand a game, and
settle for it in counters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<h4>TWENTY-ONE POINT CASSINO.</h4>

<p>This game is usually marked with counters, or pegged on a cribbage
board. Nothing is scored until the end of the hand, when
each side reckons and claims its points. In order to avoid disputes
there should be a previous understanding as to what points go out
first in a close game. In the absence of any agreement to the
contrary, the points count out in the following order:&mdash;Cards first,
then Spades, Big Cassino, Little Cassino, Aces, and Sweeps. If
the Aces have to decide it, the spade Ace goes out first, then clubs,
hearts, and diamonds. If the sweeps have to decide it, only the
difference in the number of sweeps counts, and if there is none, or
not enough, the game is not ended, and another deal must be
played.</p>

<p>It is better to agree to <i><b>count out</b></i> in twenty-one point Cassino;
each player keeping mental count of the number of cards and
spades he has taken in, together with any “natural” points. The
moment he reaches 21 he should claim the game, and if his claim
is correct he wins, even if his adversary has 21 or more. If he is
mistaken, and cannot show out, he loses the game, no matter
what his adversary’s score may be. If neither claims out, and
both are found to be, neither wins, and the game must be continued
to 32 points, and so on, eleven points more each time until one
player claims to have won the game.</p>

<p><i><b>Suggestions for Good Play.</b></i> The principal thing in Cassino
is to remember what has been played especially in the counting
and high cards, such as Aces, Eights, Nines, and Tens. In
making pairs and combinations, give preference to those containing
spades, and if you have to trail, do not play a spade if you can
help it. If three Aces have been taken in, play the fourth, if you
hold it, at the first opportunity, because it cannot be paired; but if
there is another Ace to come, keep yours until you can make a
good build with it. As between cards which were on the table
and those trailed by an adversary, take in those trailed if you have
a choice. Take in the adversary’s build in preference to your own,
if you can, and build on his build at every opportunity. If Big
Cassino is still to come, avoid trailing cards that will make a Ten
with those on the table. Go for “cards” in preference to everything
else, and always make combinations that take in as many
cards as possible. If you have a Nine, and the cards on the table
are 2 2 5 7, take in the 2 2 5, in preference to the 2 7. It is considered
bad policy to take in three court cards, as it stops all
sweeps when the fourth appears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<h4>ROYAL CASSINO.</h4>

<p>The only difference in this form of the game is that the three
court cards, K Q J, have a pip value, and may be used in combining
and building, whereas in the ordinary game they can be
used only in pairs. The Jack is worth 11, the Queen 12, and the
King 13; so that a 9 and 2 can be taken in with a Jack, or a 6 4
and 3 with a King. In the same manner a Queen will win a Jack
and Ace, or a King will win a Jack and deuce. The aces are
sometimes valued at 14 each.</p>

<h4>SPADE CASSINO.</h4>

<p>In this interesting variation every spade counts one point toward
game. The spade Jack counts one in addition to its being a
spade, and the extra point so made takes the place of the count
for “spades” in the ordinary game, so that 24 points are made in
every hand, exclusive of sweeps: Cards 3; Big Cassino 2; Little
Cassino 1; the four Aces 4; the spade Jack 1, and 13 spades.
It must be remembered that the spade Jack and deuce count 2
points each, the extra point being for the spade.</p>

<p>The game is scored on a cribbage board, every point being
pegged immediately; that is, every spade, every Ace, the Cassinos
and the sweeps. There is nothing to count at the end of the hand
but the cards. Sixty-one points is game, once round the board
and into the game hole.</p>

<h4>DRAW CASSINO.</h4>

<p>In this variation, no more cards are dealt after the first round,
but each player keeps his hand filled to four cards by drawing one
from the top of the stock as soon as he plays one from his hand.
The stock is left on the table, face down, slightly spread, for convenience
in slipping off the top card as it is drawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<h3>CONQUIAN.</h3>

<p>The etymology of this word is Spanish; <i>con quién</i>, “with whom,”
but of the game it stands for, little or nothing is known except that
it is a great favorite in Mexico, and in all the American States bordering
upon it, especially Texas. It is an excellent game for two
players, quite different from any other in its principles, and requiring
very close attention and a good memory to play it well. In its
finer points, especially in the judgment of what the adversary holds
or is playing for, it ranks with our best games, and will probably
grow in popularity as it becomes better known.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards.</b></i> Conquian is played with the Spanish pack, forty cards,
the 8 9 10 of each suit being deleted. In America, it is much
more common to play with a pack of forty cards from which the
three court cards, K Q J, have been discarded, leaving each suit
an unbroken sequence from the Ace to the Ten. Some persons
play with the full pack, but it spoils the game; as it is then possible
to win on a sequence of a single suit. There are no trumps,
and the cards have no value as to rank, a sequence of 6 7 J being
no better than one of 2 3 4. The Ace is not in sequence with the
King.</p>

<p><i><b>Counters.</b></i> Each player should be supplied with at least ten
counters, which may be used in settling at the end of each deal.</p>

<p><i><b>Players.</b></i> Conquian is played by two persons, one of whom is
known as the dealer, and the other as the pone. If there are three
at the table, the dealer takes no cards, and has no part in the
game for that hand.</p>

<p><i><b>Cutting.</b></i> Seats and deal are cut for, the lowest cut having the
choice, and dealing the first hand. The Ace is low, the King
high.</p>

<p><i><b>Stakes.</b></i> Each deal is a game in itself, and the loser pays one
counter for it. If the game is a tie, called a <i><b>tableau</b></i>, each puts up
a counter for a pool, and the winner of the next game takes the
pool, in addition to the counter paid by his adversary. If the next
game is also a tableau, each player adds another counter to the
pool, and so on until it is won.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> Ten cards are dealt to each player in five rounds of
two at a time, and the twenty remaining in the stock are laid upon
the table face down, between the players, but a little to the left of
the dealer. The stock may be slightly spread, to facilitate the
process of drawing cards from it.</p>

<p><i><b>Objects of the Game.</b></i>The object of each player is to form
triplets, fours, and sequences, by combining the cards dealt him
with others drawn from the stock. These combinations are laid
upon the table, face up, and the player wins the game who first
succeeds in laying down eleven cards in this manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Sequences</b></i> must be all of the same suit, and cannot be shorter
than three cards. The Ace is not in sequence with the King,
but the 7 is next below the Jack. A sequence once started can be
added to from time to time as the cards are drawn from the stock.</p>

<p><i><b>Triplets</b></i> are any three cards of the same denomination, and
they may be increased to <i><b>Fours</b></i> at any time, by adding the other
card.</p>

<p><i><b>Borrowing.</b></i> A player with four of a kind on the table may
borrow any one of the four to use in a sequence; but he cannot
borrow one of three, because no combination may consist of less
than three cards. In the same manner a player may borrow the
card at either end of a sequence of at least four cards, if he can
use it to make a triplet. He cannot borrow an intermediate card,
nor one of a sequence of three cards only, because three cards
must be left to maintain the sequence, but if he had a sequence of
at least five cards on the table, he might borrow the top of it to
make one triplet, and then the next card to make another triplet.</p>

<p><i><b>Method of Playing.</b></i> The cards dealt, each player sorts his
hand into sequences and triplets, and determines what cards he
wants to complete his runs, so that he may be on the lookout for
them. The pone then draws the top card from the stock and
turns it face up on the pack. If this card can be used in combination
with any of those in his hand, he draws it over to his side
of the table, and takes from his hand the cards completing the
combination of three cards, leaving them all face up. Even if he
has cards enough in his hand to increase the combination to four
or more cards, he should not show them. The cards drawn from
the stock must never be taken into the hand.</p>

<p>Let us suppose the pone holds these cards:&mdash;♡ J 7 6 4; ♠ 5 3 2;
♢ K 7 5; and that the ♡ 5 is the first card he draws. He can use
this card in three ways: By making a run of three with the ♡ 4
and ♡ 6; or a run with the ♡ 6 and ♡ 7; or a triplet with the
two other 5’s. In this case he would probably lay out the 6 and 7,
and make the run of three. If he should draw the ♡ Q later on,
he could use it by continuing the sequence with his Jack; or if
the ♡ 3 appeared, he could use it with his ♡ 4.</p>

<p><i><b>Passing.</b></i> If he cannot use the card drawn, or does not wish
to, he draws it from its position on the top of the stock and places
it between himself and the dealer, still face up. The dealer then
decides whether or not he wants it, and if he does not he
“passes” it by turning it face down, and pushing it to his right.
Cards once passed in this manner cannot again be seen by either
player. The player who passes the card turns up the next one on
the stock. If he does not want it, he places it on the table between
himself and his adversary, and if his adversary does not
want it either, he turns it down and passes it to the pile of deadwood,
turning up the top card of the stock again. In this manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
it will be seen that each player has to decide on two cards in succession;
the one drawn but not used by his adversary, and the
one he draws himself. This is continued until the stock is exhausted,
which ends the game.</p>

<p><i><b>Discarding.</b></i> If a player uses any card drawn from the stock
in this manner, it is obvious that he has too many cards, and in
order to reduce his hand and show-downs to ten cards, he must
discard something, unless he can show down everything remaining
in his hand, in which case he would have eleven cards down,
and win the game. In discarding, the card thrown out is placed
at the disposal of the adversary, as if it were the card drawn from
the stock, and if the adversary does not want it, he passes it and
draws another. It should be observed that the player drawing the
card from the stock always has the first refusal of it. This is
sometimes very important, as both players often need the same
card.</p>

<p>In the foregoing example, the player’s best discard would be his
♢ K, which is too far removed from the others in the suit to make
a run possible, and there is no mate to it with which to start a
triplet. If the adversary could use this King, he would have to
discard in his turn, and the card so thrown out would be at the
disposal of the other player, just as if it had been drawn from the
stock.</p>

<p><i><b>Forcing.</b></i> A player need not use any card drawn, but if he
has upon the table any combination in which it can be used, his
adversary may force him with it, even after it has been declined.
For instance: A player has eight cards down, two sequences of
four small cards each, and in his hand a pair of Kings. Another
King will make him game; but if he has to depend on his sequences
to put him out, he will have to get three more cards.
Suppose he draws a card that will fit one of his sequences; it is
to his advantage to pass it; but upon laying it on the table his
adversary may take it up and force him with it, by placing it at
the end of his sequence, at the same time saying: “Discard.” In
the same manner a player holding one of the cards of his adversary’s
show-down sequence or triplet may force after using a card,
by placing his discard on his adversary’s sequence, instead of laying
it on the table. If it is laid on the table, the adversary may
pass it at once, by turning it down, and it is then too late to compel
him to use it. Suppose you think your adversary holds two
cards of an unplayed sequence, and has a triplet on the table. If
you can use one of those sequence cards in his hand to advantage,
and can force him by giving him the fourth card of his triplet,
which is of no use to you, you should do so; but you must remember
that you cannot force except after using a card yourself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
because you are not allowed to discard under any other circumstances.</p>

<p>If a player looks at any of the cards that have been passed and
turned down, his adversary may take up and examine the remainder
of the stock, but without disturbing the position of the
cards therein, and without showing them. If a player looks at any
of the cards in the stock except the one he draws, his adversary
may look at all of them. If a player draws out of turn, his adversary
simply claims the card.</p>

<p><i><b>Showing.</b></i> After the last card is drawn from the stock and
passed, each player shows the remainder of his hand, and as
neither can combine his cards so as to get eleven down, it is a
tableau, and each puts a counter in the pool for the next hand.
The deal passes from one player to the other in rotation as long
as they continue to play.</p>

<p><i><b>Suggestions for Good Play.</b></i> Observation of the cards
passed will usually show what the adversary is keeping, and what
he has no chance for. Toward the end of the stock each player
should know what the other holds in his hand by the cards which
have not appeared in the drawing. If a player has not a good
chance to get eleven down himself, he should play for a tableau,
by using nothing that will compel him to discard cards which may
put his adversary out. It should be remembered that a player
cannot get eleven down in one suit, and careful observation of the
cards passed will often show that his runs are blocked, the cards
necessary to continue them having been turned down.</p>

<p>One peculiar feature of the game is that a player cannot block
his adversary and at the same time win the game, because so long
as he holds up the card that his adversary wants he cannot get
eleven down himself. His only chance is that he may be able to
use the card that his adversary needs. For instance: He holds
two 8’s, one of which will make his adversary eleven down by
completing a sequence. If there is another 8 to come, the player
with the pair may use both his 8’s, and win; but if there is no
other 8 to come, it is impossible for the player with the two 8’s to
win without first putting his adversary out.</p>

<h3>CALABRASELLA.</h3>

<p>This is a very popular game with the middle classes and the unoccupied
clergy in Italy, and it is one of the very few good games
of cards for three players. If the game were better known, the
author is sure it would become a great favourite, especially with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
those who are fond of the whist family, because Calabrasella is an
excellent training school for the use of cards of re-entry, long
suits, and tenace positions in the end game. In the combination
of two players against the third its tactics very closely resemble
Skat, and many interesting and difficult positions occur in every
game.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards.</b></i> Calabrasella is played with the Spanish pack, forty
cards, the 10 9 and 8 of each suit being discarded. The cards
rank: 3 2 A K Q J 7 6 5 4, the 3 being the highest, and the 4 the
lowest, both in cutting and in play. There are no trumps.</p>

<p><i><b>Markers.</b></i> The game may be scored by paying and taking in
counters, each player being provided with about fifty at the beginning
of the game, which are purchased from a banker; but the
better way is to keep account of the gains and losses of the single
player in each deal, in the manner already described in connection
with Skat, balancing the account at the end in the same way.</p>

<p><i><b>Players.</b></i> Calabrasella is played by three persons, two of
whom are partners against the third in each hand. If four play,
the dealer takes no cards, but shares the fortunes of those who are
opposed to the single player, just as in Skat. The players on the
right and left of the dealer are known as the pone and the eldest
hand respectively.</p>

<p><i><b>Cutting.</b></i> The players cut for seats and deal, the lowest card
having the first choice and dealing the first hand. A player exposing
more than one card must cut again.</p>

<p><i><b>Stakes.</b></i> The game is played for so much a point. The largest
winning or loss for the single player is 140, but such an amount is
almost impossible, and the average payments are 10 or 20.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> The cards are presented to the pone to be cut, and
at least four must be left in each packet. The dealer then distributes
them to the players four at a time, until each has twelve,
four remaining in the stock or talon, which is left upon the table
face down. No trump is turned. The deal passes to the left.</p>

<p>There are no misdeals. If the cards are not properly distributed,
or four cards are not left in the talon, the same dealer must
deal again, without penalty.</p>

<p><i><b>Objects of the Game.</b></i> The chief objects of the game are to
win the last trick, and to secure counting cards in the other tricks
in the course of play. There are 35 points to be played for in
every deal. The six highest cards in each suit, 3 2 A K Q J, have
a counting value, the Ace being worth 3, and the others 1 each.
The last trick counts 3.</p>

<p><i><b>Declaring.</b></i> The eldest hand examines his cards and determines
whether or not he will <i><b>stand</b></i>; that is, play single handed
against the two others. If not, he says “<i><b>pass</b></i>,” and the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
player decides. If all three pass, the deal is void, and passes to
the next player on the left. If any player stands, he asks for the 3
of any suit he pleases, and if either adversary holds it, he must
give it up. If it is in the stock, the player cannot ask for any
other card. If he has all four 3’s in his hand he may ask for a 2,
but for no lower card. The adversary giving the card asked for
must receive a card in exchange from the hand of the single
player, but this card must not be shown to the other adversary.</p>

<p><i><b>Discarding.</b></i> Having given a card in exchange for the 3
asked for, the single player must discard at least one more card,
face downward on the table, and he may discard as many as four.
The four cards remaining in the stock are then turned face up, and
the single player may select from them as many cards as he has
discarded; but he is not allowed to amend his discard in any way.
The cards he does not take, if any, are turned down again, and
are placed with his discards, forming a stock of four cards, which
must not be seen or touched until the last card is played, when it
becomes the property of the side that wins the last trick, and any
counting cards it may contain are reckoned for that side.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing.</b></i> The discards settled, the eldest hand leads any
card he pleases, and the others must follow suit if they can, but
no one is obliged to win a trick if he has a smaller card of the suit
led, and does not want the lead. The two adversaries of the single
player do their best to get him between them, and combine
their forces to prevent him from winning tricks that contain counting
cards, especially Aces. Whatever tricks they win are placed
together, and the counting cards contained in them reckon for their
joint account. The tricks have no value as such, except the last.</p>

<p><i><b>Showing.</b></i> The winner of the last trick takes the stock, and
each side then turns over its cards and counts the total value of
the points won. The lower score is deducted from the higher, and
the difference is the value of the game. If all 35 points are won
by either side, they count double, 70.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> If the single player loses, he loses to both adversaries,
and if he wins he wins from both. His score is the only one
put down, and the amount is preceded with a minus or plus sign
according to the result. If he secures 23 points, he wins 11; if he
takes in 16 only, he loses 3. If the amount is less than 18 it must
be a loss; if it is 18 or more it must be a gain. The method of
balancing the scores at the end will be found fully explained in
connection with Skat.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities.</b></i> The penalty for a revoke is the loss of 9
points, which are taken from the score of the side in error at the
end of the hand, and added to the side not in fault. If the final
score is 24 to 11, for instance, in favour of the single player, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
one of the partners has revoked, the score is 33 to 2, and the player
wins 31 points. If any player turns over the stock before he has
announced to stand and has discarded at least one card, he loses
35 points to each adversary, and the deal is void. If an adversary
of the single player turns over the stock before the player has discarded,
there is no penalty, and the player may discard as he
pleases. If an adversary of the single player leads or plays out of
turn, the player may abandon the hand at that point, and claim
the stock and last trick, the adversaries being entitled to count
only the points they have won up to the time the error occurred.</p>

<p><i><b>Suggestions for Good Play.</b></i> The general tactics of the
game are extremely like those employed in Whist and Skat. The
player establishes his long suit as rapidly as possible, and preserves
his tenaces and cards of re-entry. The adversaries of the player
should lead short suits up to him, and long suits through him, and
every opportunity should be taken advantage of to discard counting
cards on partner’s tricks, Aces especially, which are not the
best of the suit, but count the most. Both sides scheme to get
their hands in shape for winning the last trick, which usually
makes a difference of ten or twelve points in the score, owing to
the high cards held back, and those found in the stock. Each side
should keep mental count of its score, so as to know whether or
not it must win the last trick to get to 18. The exposure of the
stock, the number of cards discarded by the player, the suits which
are led and avoided, will all prove useful guides in determining
where the strength or weakness in each suit lies, and proper advantage
should be taken of all such inferences.</p>

<p>Some judgment is required in selecting the suit in which the 3 is
to be asked for, and the single player must plan in advance for all
his discards, one for the exchange, and those for the stock. The
player’s position at the table makes quite a difference. The leader
has an advantage with a good long suit; but with tenaces it is
better to be third player, and very bad to be second hand.</p>

<p>Some pretty positions arise in the end game through the refusal
of players to win tricks which would put them in the lead, and so
lose them the last trick and the stock. After the first few tricks,
everything must be arranged with a view to securing that last
trick, but the importance of getting home with Aces must never
be overlooked. These count 12 points in every hand, and the side
that can get in three out of the four has 6 points the best of it.</p>

<h3>VINT.</h3>

<p>While this game is by some persons thought to be the forerunner
of bridge, and might be classed as one of the whist family,
it is at present so little known outside of Russia, where it is the
national game, that the author has thought it best to group it with
other games which are distinctly national in character.</p>

<p>Vint has been variously described as bridge without a Dummy
and as auction whist. It resembles bridge in the making of the
trump, and whist in the manner of the play.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards.</b></i> Vint is played with the full pack of fifty-two cards,
which rank from the A K Q down to the deuce. Two packs are
generally used.</p>

<p><i><b>Players.</b></i> A table is complete with four players, and if there
are more than four candidates for play the selection must be made
by cutting. All the rules for formation of tables, cutting, ties, etc.,
are the same as at bridge. The lowest cut takes the deal. Partners
sit opposite each other.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> The dealer presents the pack to be cut, and then
gives thirteen cards to each player, one at a time. No trump is
turned. The deal passes to the left. All irregularities are governed
by the same laws as bridge.</p>

<p><i><b>Making the trump.</b></i> Each player in turn, beginning with
the dealer, bids to make a certain number of tricks, from seven to
thirteen, with a suit of his own choosing, which he names when he
makes his bid. The suits outrank one another in the order of
hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades, hearts being the best. No-trumps
are higher than hearts. A bid of seven tricks is usually
called “one” in hearts, or whatever the suit may be. A bid of
“two” means to win eight tricks, or two over the book.</p>

<p><i><b>Bidding.</b></i> If a player wishes to go over the first offer made,
he must either bid the same number of tricks in a better suit, or he
must increase the number of tricks. No player can increase his
own bid unless he is overbid in the interval, but there is no limit to
the number of times that players may outbid one another. Observe
that the dealer may bid or pass, and each player after him in turn
may bid or pass. The highest bidder must abide by his announcement
both as to the number of tricks and the suit.</p>

<p><i><b>The Play.</b></i> No matter who dealt the cards, the player to the
left of the highest bidder always leads for the first trick. Each
player in turn must follow suit if he can, and the highest card
played, if of the suit led, wins the trick, trumps winning all other
suits. The winner of one trick leads for the next, and so on. There
is no Dummy hand as in bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> Although the bidding is for so many “odd” tricks,
or tricks over the book, every trick taken is counted when it comes
to the scoring; but it is the number of tricks bid, and not the rank
of the suit, that determines the value. Every trick won by the
same partners&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Scores">
  <tr>
    <td>In a bid of “one” is worth</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In a bid of “two” is worth</td>
    <td class="tdr">20</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In a bid of “three” is worth</td>
    <td class="tdr">30</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In a bid of “four” is worth</td>
    <td class="tdr">40</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In a bid of “five” is worth</td>
    <td class="tdr">50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In a bid of “six” is worth</td>
    <td class="tdr">60</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In a bid of “seven” is worth</td>
    <td class="tdr">70</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Both sides score. If the highest bid was “two in diamonds,”
and the bidder’s side won nine tricks, they would score 9 times 20,
or 180; while their adversaries would score 4 times 20, or 80.</p>

<p>As soon as either side reaches 500, they win the game, even if it
is in the middle of a hand; but the hand must be played out in
order to see how many points are won by each side. It should be
observed that although the bidder’s side may make nine or ten
tricks the adversaries can win the game if they get enough to count
out before the bidder, by reaching 500 first.</p>

<p><i><b>Tricks and Honours.</b></i> The score for tricks and for honours
must be kept separate, usually above and below the line, as at
bridge. All trick points, which are the only ones that count toward
game, are placed below the line; the honour points above.</p>

<p>For winning a game, 1,000 points are added in the honour column.
The side that first wins two games of 500 points each adds
2,000 rubber points in the honour column.</p>

<p><i><b>Slams.</b></i> If a little slam, 12 tricks, is made, but has not been
bid, it is worth 1,000 points in honours. If a little slam, “six
tricks,” has been bid and is made, it is worth 5,000 more for bidding
it, or 6,000 altogether. If a grand slam, 13 tricks, is made but
not bid, it is worth 2,000 honour points. If a little slam is bid and
a grand slam made, it is worth 7,000 altogether. If a grand slam is
bid and made, it is worth 12,000 altogether.</p>

<p><i><b>Lost Games.</b></i> If the bidder fails to make good, his adversaries
score 100 times the value of the tricks as penalty, in the honour
column; the scores for the tricks actually won standing at their
regular value below the line. Suppose the bid to be three in diamonds,
making the tricks worth 30 each, and that the bidder’s side
get the odd trick only. Although the bidder has failed to make
good, he scores below the line for the seven tricks he took, at 30
each, and the adversaries score for the six they took, also at 30
each. Then, as the bidder fell short by two tricks of making good,
his adversaries score these two tricks at 3,000 points each, penalty,
in the honour column.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Honours.</b></i> The honours are the A K Q J 10 of trumps and
the four Aces, the Aces being always honours; but when there is
a no-trump declaration they are the only honours. This makes the
Ace of trumps count double, when there is a trump suit; once as
one of the five honours in trumps, and once as an Ace.</p>

<p>Each honour is worth ten times as much as a trick. If the bid
was three in clubs, the tricks would be worth 30 each and the honours
300 each. The side that has the majority of Aces and of
honours scores for all they hold; not for the majority or difference.
Suppose the bidder’s side has three honours in clubs and
three Aces; the other side must have only two honours and one
Ace; therefore the bidder scores for six honours, at 300 each.</p>

<p>If the Aces and honours in trumps are so divided that each side
has a majority of one or the other, they offset. Suppose the bidder
to hold four Aces and two honours. The adversaries must have
the majority of trump honours. Then the number of their trump
honours, which is three, is deducted from the number of the bidder’s
Aces, four, leaving the bidder’s side only one honour to the
good. Three honours on one side and three Aces on the other
would be a tie, and no honours to score.</p>

<p>If the Aces are a tie, the side that wins the most tricks scores
them. Suppose the bidder has three honours and two Aces. He
scores five honours if he wins the odd trick; otherwise he scores
one only, the Aces being a tie and he having only one more honour
than his adversaries.</p>

<p>In no-trump hands, the honours are worth 25 times the value of
the tricks. If Aces are easy, neither side scores. If one has three
Aces, they are all scored. Suppose the bid to have been “two at
no-trumps,” then the Aces are worth 25 times 20, and three of them
are worth 1,500 points.</p>

<p><i><b>Coronets.</b></i> A sequence of three or more cards in any suit,
trumps or plain, held by an individual player, is a coronet. Three
or four Aces in one hand is also a coronet. When there is a trump
suit, three Aces, or three of a plain suit in sequence, are worth 500
in the honour column. Each additional card is worth 500 points
more. A sequence of K Q J 10 9 would be worth 1,500. In the
trump suit, and in all the suits when there are no trumps, these
coronets are worth double, and each additional card is therefore
worth 1,000 more.</p>

<p><i><b>Rubbers.</b></i> As soon as one side wins two games, that ends the
first rubber. The partners then change, without cutting, in such a
manner that at the end of three rubbers each player shall have had
each of the others for a partner. At the end of the third rubber,
the losses and gains are ascertained for each individual, and settled
for.</p>

<p><i><b>Laws.</b></i> The laws that govern the game are almost identical
with those for Bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>

<h3>PREFERENCE.</h3>

<p>This is a simplified form of Vint, for three players, with a thirty-two-card
pack. The cards rank: A K Q J 10 9 8 7, and the suits
rank: Hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Hearts are always
<i><b>preference</b></i>. There are no hands played without a trump suit.</p>

<p>If four persons play, the dealer takes no cards. The three active
players make up a pool, each putting in an equal amount at first,
and the bidder putting into it as many as he bids for the privilege
of naming the trump suit.</p>

<p>Any one may deal the first hand, after which the deal passes to
the left. Three cards are given to each player the first round, then
two are laid off for a widow, then four to each player, and then
three to each. Beginning on the dealer’s left, each player in turn
may name the trump if he thinks he can take at least six of the ten
tricks to be played for. Bids outrank one another in the order of
the suits, hearts being preference always. The number of tricks is
not mentioned. In case there are no bids, each in turn has a second
chance to bid for the widow. These bids are made in counters,
to be put into the pool. The highest bidder takes the widow,
lays out two cards, and then names the trump suit.</p>

<p>The players agree upon a value for the tricks won, and payments
are made from the pool accordingly. These payments may vary
according to the rank of the trump suit.</p>

<h2 id="ODD_GAMES">ODD GAMES.</h2>

<p>There are quite a number of odd games of cards, which come
and go as favourites from time to time, and pass round the world
from one country to another under many different names. The
origin of most of these games is lost in the weedy undergrowth of
variations, but the chief family trait in some of them can be traced
back to the alpha of cards.</p>

<p>Among the oldest of games was Ombre, immortalised by Pope,
the only survivor of which is a variation played by the older Germans,
under the name of Solo; a game which still faintly resists
the exterminating influence of Skat. The ancient and honourable
games of Comète, Hoc, and Nain Jaune survive to the present day
in a large and prosperous family, ranging from Commit to Fan Tan,
the latter being to-day quite a favourite among those who like simple
and amusing games, free from mental effort. Fan Tan is unfortunately
named, as many persons confuse it with the Chinese
banking game, and it would be much better under its older name,
Play or Pay.</p>

<p>Among the many games of which everyone has heard, and which
many thousands have been advised to play, is one which, strange
to say, is not to be found described in any work on card games,
and that is Old Maid. There was a time when the result of this
game was supposed to be final and conclusive, and parties of
young men have been known to substitute a Jack or King for the
discarded Queen, in order to learn what the future had in store for
them. Under such circumstances the game became Old Bachelor,
of course.</p>

<p>For those who believe in the verdict of the cards, there are
other sources of information. Fortune telling, whether for the
purpose of amusement or self-deception, has undoubtedly interested
many persons in all stations of life ever since Eittella first
explained the art, away back in the sixteenth century. The meanings
attached to the cards individually, and the manner of their
arrangement, is all that can be given in a work of this kind. The
qualifications for success in foretelling the future do not depend
so much on the cards as on good judgment of human nature, unlimited
assurance, a glib tongue, and a certain amount of ingenuity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
in making a connected story out of the disjointed sentences
formed by the chance arrangement of certain cards, to which an
arbitrary or fanciful meaning is attached.</p>

<p>Speculation is considered by some persons an excellent training
school for the commercial instincts of the younger members of a
family, teaching them to form correct estimates as to the value of
certain articles offered for sale in a fluctuating market. Authors
is a very good game for the family circle, and does not require
special cards, the ordinary pack being easily adapted to the distinctions
of the game.</p>

<p>Patience, or Solitaire, has probably claimed the attention of every
card-player at some time or other, and one cannot fail to be impressed
by the number and ingenuity of the patience games which
have been invented. One of the most expensive works on cards
ever published is devoted exclusively to Solitaire.</p>

<p>Among all these odd games one should be able to find something
to amuse all sorts and conditions of card-players. The only
apparatus required in any of them is a pack of cards and a few
counters, and for the latter corn or coffee-beans will form an excellent
substitute.</p>

<h3>SOLO.</h3>

<p>Under the name of Solo, the Germans play a great many variations
of card games, of which the following is the best known.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards.</b></i> Solo is played with a pack of thirty-two cards, which
rank A K Q J 10 9 8 7. One suit is always first preference, or
<i><b>colour</b></i>, and the suit usually selected is clubs. Any suit may be
made the trump, but whatever the suit, the club Queen, <i><b>Spadilla</b></i>,
is always the best trump; the Seven of the trump suit, <i><b>Manilla</b></i>,
is always the second-best trump; and the spade Queen, <i><b>Basta</b></i>,
is always the third-best trump.</p>

<p><i><b>Players.</b></i> Solo is played by four persons, who throw round
the cards for the first club turned up to deal eight cards to each
player; 3-2-3 at a time.</p>

<p><i><b>Objects.</b></i> The object of the game is to secure the privilege of
naming the trump suit, and of playing, either alone or with a partner,
to make five tricks, <i><b>solo</b></i>, or eight tricks, <i><b>tout</b></i>. If a partner
is required, he is selected by the player asking for a certain ace,
but the holder of the ace remains unknown until the ace falls,
although from the first he must assist the player who has asked for
it. If a player asks for an ace while holding it himself, he of
course plays without a partner, unknown to the others however,
until he plays the ace asked for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Bidding.</b></i> The players bid against one another for the privilege
of naming the trump suit, eldest hand having the first say.
When no one will bid any higher, the player who has made the
best offer names the game he wishes to play, with or without a
partner.</p>

<p><i><b>Games.</b></i> The rank of the various games, the amounts bid on
them, and the payments made for them, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Ranks, amounts, payments">
  <tr>
    <td>Simple in suit,</td>
    <td class="tdr">2;</td>

    <td class="tdr">32.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><i><b>Simple Game</b></i> is to play for five tricks with a partner holding
a designated ace. If the trump is clubs, (in colour,) it is worth
double, 4 counters.</p>

<p><i><b>Solo</b></i> is five tricks without a partner. With clubs trumps it
pays double, 8 counters.</p>

<p><i><b>Tout</b></i> is eight tricks, with or without a partner. If alone, the
single player wins or loses all; if with a partner he must share his
gains or losses.</p>

<p><i><b>Forcée</b></i> is when no bid is made, and any player holds both
Spadilla and Basta. He must play a Solo, or call for an ace. If
he calls, the player holding the ace names the trump suit; but the
suit so named must not be the suit of the called ace. Forcée in
clubs is worth double, 8 counters.</p>

<p><i><b>Playing.</b></i> The trump named, the eldest hand leads any card
he pleases, and the others must follow suit if they can. The highest
card played, if of the suit led, wins the trick, and trumps win
all other suits. The hands are abandoned as soon as the bidder
takes five tricks, if he is playing anything but a tout. If he goes
on he must win all eight tricks, or lose the value of a tout.</p>

<p><i><b>Payments.</b></i> A solo player wins from or loses to each of his
adversaries individually the amount of the game in counters. Two
partners pay or receive each from one adversary.</p>

<p><i><b>HEART SOLO</b></i> is a game for three players, in which the
pack is reduced to twenty-four cards by deleting the Eight of
hearts, and all the diamonds but the Seven. Diamonds are always
colour, and there are only three trumps in that suit; Spadilla,
Manilla, and Basta. The only play is for the Solo, and if no one
will make a bid, the hands are played in colour, and the winner of
the last trick loses the value of a Solo.</p>

<h3>AUTHORS.</h3>

<p>This game was originally played with cards bearing the names
of various authors, and other famous personages, arranged in
groups, but the game is much simpler when played with an ordinary
pack of fifty-two cards.</p>

<p>Any number of persons can play. The cards are shuffled and
spread, and the person drawing the lowest card deals the first
hand. The ace is low. Each player then deposits a counter in
the pool, and the cards are distributed one at a time until the pack
is exhausted. If some players have a card more than others it
makes no difference.</p>

<p>The <i><b>object</b></i> of the game is to secure tricks consisting of four
cards of the same denomination; such as four 6’s or four K’s, and
the player having the most tricks of this kind wins the pool. Ties
divide it.</p>

<p>The player on the left of the dealer begins by <i><b>asking</b></i> for a
certain card, which must be of the same denomination as one already
in his hand. For instance: He holds the spade Ten. He
may ask any one at the table for either of the three other Tens;
but he must designate the suit, and must ask a particular player
for the card wanted. If the player asked has the card, he must
immediately surrender it, and the player to whom it is given can
then ask again&mdash;any player for any card, always provided that the
asker has one of the same denomination in his own hand.</p>

<p>If the person asked has not the card demanded, the privilege
of asking is transferred to him, and he may ask any person at the
table for any card of the same denomination as one already in his
own hand. If he has just been asked for a Ten, for instance, and
has a Ten, but not of the suit asked for, he might turn upon his
questioner and get a Ten from him, if he could guess the right
suit.</p>

<p>As soon as any player gets together four cards of the same denomination,
he lays them face down upon the table in front of
him, and they form a trick.</p>

<p>A good memory is necessary to play this game well, as it is very
important to recall who has asked for certain cards, and which
players were unable to supply them. It is a legitimate artifice in
the game to ask for a card you already have in your own hand,
although you know it will lose your guess, because it may be the
only way to prevent another player from drawing several valuable
cards from you. For instance: You hold the Fives of diamonds
and spades, and have asked for and received the Five of clubs.
If you ask for the heart Five, and miss it, the player with that card
may draw all yours; but if you ask for the spade Five, and he gets
into the ask, he will at once betray the fact that he holds the
fourth Five by asking you for the club Five; but he will never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
think of asking you for the spade Five, because you asked for it
yourself. If you can get into the ask again you can immediately
make a trick in Fives.</p>

<h3>SPECULATION.</h3>

<p>Any number of persons less than ten can play, each contributing
an agreed number of counters to the pool, the dealer paying
double. The full pack of fifty-two cards is used, and the cards
rank from the A K Q down to the 2.</p>

<p>In <i><b>dealing</b></i>, the cards are distributed from left to right, one at
a time, until each player has received three. The next card on
the top of the pack is turned up, and the suit to which it belongs is
the trump, and forms the basis of speculation for that deal. If
the turn-up card is an ace, the dealer takes the pool immediately,
and the deal passes to the left. If the turn-up is a K Q or J, the
dealer offers it for sale, before a card is looked at, and he may
accept or refuse the amount offered. Whether the card is sold or
not, all the cards that have been dealt out are turned face up, and
the highest card of the turn-up suit wins the pool. If the card is
not an honour, the dealer proceeds to sell it before any player is
allowed to look at any of the cards dealt. If any one buys the
dealer’s turn-up card, the purchaser places it on his own cards,
leaving it face up. Whether it is sold or not, the elder hand proceeds
to turn up the top card of his three. If this is not a trump,
the next player on his left turns up his top card, and so on until a
trump is turned that is better than the one already exposed. The
player who possesses the original turn-up, does not expose any
more of his cards until a better trump is shown. As soon as a
better trump appears it is offered for sale, and after it is sold or
refused, the cards are turned up again until a better trump appears,
or all the cards have been exposed. The holder of the best
trump at the end takes the pool.</p>

<h3>OLD MAID.</h3>

<p>Strange to say, this oft-quoted and continually derided game is
not mentioned in any work on cards, a singular omission which we
hasten to supply.</p>

<p>Any number of young ladies may play, and a pack of fifty-one
cards is used, the Queen of hearts having been deleted. Any
player can deal the cards, which are distributed one at a time until
the pack is exhausted; if every player has not the same number it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
does not matter. Beginning with the eldest hand, each player
sorts her cards into pairs of the same denomination; such as two
Fives, two Jacks, etc., and all pairs so formed are laid upon the
table face down, without showing them to the other players. All
the cards laid out in this manner are left in front of the player, in
order to discover errors, if any. Three of a kind cannot be discarded,
but four of a kind may be considered as two pairs.</p>

<p>The discarding of pairs complete, the dealer begins by spreading
her remaining cards like a fan, and presenting them, face downward,
to her left-hand neighbour, who must draw one card at random.
The card so drawn is examined, and if it completes a pair,
the two cards are discarded. Whether it forms a pair or not, the
player’s cards are spread and presented to the next player on the
left, to be drawn from in the same manner.</p>

<p>This process of drawing, forming pairs, and discarding is continued
until it is found that one player remains with one card.
This card is of course the odd Queen, and the unfortunate holder
of it is the Old Maid; but only for that deal.</p>

<h3>LIFT SMOKE.</h3>

<p>The number of players must be limited to six, each of whom
deposits a counter in the pool. A full pack of fifty-two cards is
used. The cards rank from the ace down to the deuce, as at
Whist. If there are four players, six cards are dealt to each, one
at a time; if five play, five cards to each, and if six play, four cards
to each. The last card that falls to the dealer is turned up for the
trump, and the remainder of the pack is placed in the centre of the
table as a stock to draw from.</p>

<p>The eldest hand leads for the first trick, and the others must
follow suit if they can. The highest card played, if of the suit led,
wins the trick, and trumps win all other suits. The winner of each
trick draws the top card from the talon, and leads again. When
any player’s cards are exhausted he withdraws from the game, and
the others continue. The player who remains to the end, having
a card when his adversary has none, wins the pool. If two players
remain with a card each, the winner of the trick draws from the
stock, and the card so drawn wins the game, his adversary having
none.</p>

<h3>EARL OF COVENTRY.</h3>

<p>This game is sometimes called Snip Snap Snorem, by those
who are not of a poetical turn of mind. Any number of persons
may play, and a full pack of cards is dealt out, one at a time. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
some players have a card more than others, it does not matter.
The eldest hand lays upon the table any card he pleases, and each
player in turn pairs or matches it, if he can, with another of the
same denomination, accompanying the action with a rhyme. Suppose
the first card played is a King; the person playing it would
say: “There’s as good as King can be.” The first player to lay
down another King would say: “There is one as good as he.”
The player holding the third King would say: “There’s the best
of all the three,” and the holder of the fourth would then triumphantly
exclaim: “And there’s the Earl of Coventry.”</p>

<p>The fortunate holder of the Earl of Coventry in each round has
the privilege of leading a card for the next trick, and the first
player to get rid of all his cards wins one counter from the others
for every card they hold. The words, “Snip, Snap, Snorem,”
may be substituted for the foregoing rhymes if time is short.</p>

<p><i><b>Jig</b></i> is a variation of Earl of Coventry in which the next higher
in sequence and suit must be played, if the player has it, until four
cards are shown. The one who lays down the last of the sequence
of four cards starts a fresh sequence, and the winner is the one who
can first get rid of all the cards originally dealt him. All the others
then pay him a counter for each card they have left.</p>

<h3>COMMIT.</h3>

<p>The etymology of this word has been quite overlooked by those
who have described the game. The word is from the French,
cométe, a comet; but instead of being an equivalent in English, it
is simply a phonetic equivalent; Commit, instead of Comet.
Tenac informs us that the game was invented during the appearance
of Halley’s comet; and the idea of the game is that of a
string of cards forming a tail to the one first played, a feature
which is common to quite a number of the older games of cards.</p>

<p>Commit is played by any number of persons, with a pack of fifty-one
cards, the Eight of diamonds having been deleted. The
players draw for positions at the table and for the first deal, and
make up a pool. The cards have no value except the order of
their sequence in the various suits. The ace is not in sequence
with the King, but below the 2. The dealer distributes the cards,
one at a time to each player in rotation, as far as they will go, leaving
any odd cards on the table face downward, to form what are
known as <i><b>stops</b></i>. As it is desirable to have a number of these
stops, it is usual to give only nine cards to each when there are
five players.</p>

<p>The eldest hand begins by leading any card he pleases which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
he lays face upward in the centre of the table. If he holds any
other cards in sequence above it, he must play them, and when he
can no longer continue the series, he says aloud: “Without the
Jack,” or whatever the card may be that he fails on. The player
on his left must then continue the sequence in the same suit, if he
can; or he must say: “Without the Jack.” When the sequence
reaches the King, it is stopped, and the player who held the King
receives a counter from each player at the table. The same player
then begins another sequence with any card he pleases. If a
sequence is opened with an ace, a counter may be demanded from
each player at the table.</p>

<p>If a sequence is stopped, which it will be if the card necessary to
continue it is in the stock, or if the diamonds are run up to the
Seven, the person who plays the last card before the stop is entitled
to begin another sequence. Should any player who is unable to
continue a sequence in his proper turn, hold the Nine of diamonds,
he may play that card, and the player following him is then at
liberty to continue the original sequence or to play the Ten of diamonds,
following up that sequence. When the Nine of diamonds
is played, the holder receives two counters from each player at the
table; but if it is not got rid of in play, the holder of it must pay
two counters to each of the other players.</p>

<p>The first player to get rid of all his cards wins the pool, and the
cards remaining in the other hands are then exposed. Any player
holding a King must pay a counter for it to each of the other
players.</p>

<h3>MATRIMONY.</h3>

<p>Any number of persons may play, and a full pack of fifty-two
cards is used. Each player should be provided with an equal
number of counters, to which a trifling value may be attached. A
strip of paper is placed in the centre of the table, marked as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="The strip of paper">
  <tr>
    <td class="b-all">Matrimony.</td>
    <td class="b-all">Intrigue.</td>
    <td class="b-all">Confederacy.</td>
    <td class="b-all">Pair.</td>
    <td class="b-all">Best.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Any King and Queen is <i><b>Matrimony</b></i>; any Queen and Jack is
<i><b>Intrigue</b></i>; any King and Jack is <i><b>Confederacy</b></i>; any two cards
of the same denomination form a <i><b>Pair</b></i>, and the diamond ace is
always <i><b>Best</b></i>.</p>

<p>The players draw, and the lowest card deals: ace is low. The
dealer then takes any number of counters he chooses, and distributes
them as he pleases on the various divisions of the layout.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
Each player then takes a number of counters one less than the
dealer’s, and distributes them according to his fancy.</p>

<p>The cards are then cut, and the dealer gives one to each player,
face down; and then another, face up. If any of the latter should
be the diamond ace, the player to whom it is dealt takes everything
on the layout, and the cards are gathered and shuffled again,
the deal passing to the left, the new dealer beginning a fresh pool.
If the diamond ace is not turned up, each player in turn, beginning
with the eldest hand, exposes his down card. The first
player to discover Matrimony in his two cards, takes all that has
been staked on that division of the layout. The first to discover
Intrigue or Confederacy, takes all on that, and the first player to
expose a Pair takes that pool. The ace of diamonds is of no value
except as one of a pair, if it is one of the cards that were dealt to
the players face down. The pool for it remains until the card is
dealt to some player face up. Any of the pools which are not won
must remain until the following deal, and may be added to.</p>

<h3>POPE JOAN.</h3>

<p>This game is a combination of the layout in Matrimony, and the
manner of playing in Commit. There are a great many ways of
dividing the layout, but the following is the simplest. Five cards
are taken from an old pack, and are laid out in the centre of the
table, or their names are written on a sheet of paper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/p505.jpg" width="175" height="220" alt="🂾 🂭 |🃇 |🃊 🃛" />
</div>

<p>The cards are thrown round for the deal, and the first Jack
deals. The cards are distributed one at a time, the full pack of
fifty-two cards being used. The following table will show the
number of cards to be given to each player, and that left in the
stock to form stops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span></p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>Before the deal, the dealer must dress the layout, by putting
one counter upon the Ten, two upon the Jack, three upon the
Queen, four upon the King, and five on the Pope, which is the
Seven (or the Nine) of diamonds.</p>

<p>The eldest hand begins by leading any card he pleases, and if
he has those in sequence and suit with it and above it, he continues
to play until he fails. He then says “No six,” or whatever
the card may be that he stops on. The next player on his left
then continues the sequence if he can, or if he cannot, he says,
“No six,” also, and it passes to the next player. If no one can
continue, the card must be in the stock, which remains on the
table face down and unseen. When one sequence <i>is</i> stopped in
this manner, the last player has the right to begin another with any
card he pleases.</p>

<p>The object of the game is twofold; to get rid of all the cards
before any other player does so, and to get rid of the cards which
appear on the layout. If the duplicate of any of those cards can
be played, the holder of the card at once takes all the money
staked upon it; but if he fails to get rid of it before some player
wins the game by getting rid of all his cards, the player who is
found with one of the layout cards in his hand at the end must
double the amount staked on that card, to which the next dealer
will add the usual contribution.</p>

<p>The player who first gets rid of all his cards collects from the
other players a counter for every card they hold. These cards
must be exposed face up on the table, so that all may see who has
to double the various pools. If any of the layout cards are in the
stock, the pool simply remains, without doubling.</p>

<p>There are a great many variations of Pope Joan. Sometimes a
layout very similar to that in Matrimony is used, Pope taking the
place of Pair, and Game that of Best. A trump is turned by the
dealer, and Matrimony is King and Queen of trumps, Intrigue
Queen and Jack of trumps, Confederacy, King and Jack of trumps.
The player holding these cards will of course be able to play both
of them if he can play one in a sequence, and will take the pool
for the combination. If he holds one card and another player
holds the other, they divide the pool. If one of the cards is in the
stock, the pool remains. In some places it is the custom to remove
the Eight of diamonds, as at Commit, to form an extra and known
stop. The player first getting rid of his cards takes the pool on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
Game, and the holder of Pope takes that pool if he can get rid of
the card in the course of play, if not, he must double the pool, just
as with the honours in trumps.</p>

<h3>NEWMARKET, OR STOPS.</h3>

<p>This game, which is sometimes called Boodle, is Pope Joan
without the pope. The four cards forming the layout are the
♡A, ♣K, ♢Q, ♠J; but there is no ♢7. The dealer names any
number of counters that he is willing to stake, which must be at
least four, and each player at the table must stake a similar
amount. The counters are placed on the layout to suit the players,
either all upon one card, or distributed among the four. The
cards are dealt as at Pope Joan, and the same number must be
left in the talon.</p>

<p>Instead of the player being at liberty to begin a sequence with
any card he pleases, he must begin with the lowest card in his
hand of the suit which he selects. He is not restricted as to suit,
but must play all he has in sequence, and then name the card that
he fails on. If a new sequence is opened by any player, he must
play the lowest card of the suit in his hand.</p>

<p>If, in the course of play, any of the four cards on the layout can
be got rid of, the player holding them takes the pool on that card.
If he is left with the card in his hand at the end he is not obliged
to double the pool, as at Pope Joan, but simply loses his chance to
win it, and it remains until the next deal. The first player to get
rid of all his cards receives one counter from the other players for
each card they hold.</p>

<p><i><b>SPIN</b></i> is Newmarket, with one variation. The player holding
the diamond ace is allowed to play it in order to get the privilege
of stopping one suit and opening another. For instance: The
sequence in spades has run to the Nine, and one player holds
both spade Ten and diamond ace. If this player saw that another
was very likely to win the game at any moment, and he had a pool
card to play, he might stop the spade sequence by playing both
the Ten and the diamond ace together, announcing <i><b>Spin</b></i>. He
can then play a pool card, or begin a new sequence with the lowest
of the suit in his hand. He cannot play the diamond ace
unless he can play to the sequence first.</p>

<p><i><b>SARATOGA.</b></i> This varies from Newmarket only in the
method of making up the pool. Instead of leaving the players to
distribute their stakes at pleasure, each is compelled to place an
agreed amount on each of the pool cards, as at Pope Joan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<h3>POCHEN.</h3>

<p>This is a round game for any number of players from three to
six, with a thirty-two-card pack. The layout has a centre division
for pools and seven other divisions round it, marked, respectively,
A, K, Q, J, 10, Marriage, Sequence. Each player dresses the layout
by placing a counter in each of the eight divisions. The dealer
then gives cards three and then two at a time, as far as they will go
equally, turning up the next for the trump.</p>

<p>The holders of the five highest trumps show them and take the
corresponding pools, Ace of trumps the A pool, etc. If any player
holds both K and Q of trumps, he takes the pool for marriage. The
player holding the highest and longest sequence in any suit takes
the pool for sequence; but the sequence must be at least three
cards. Pools not won remain until the next deal.</p>

<p>After the pools round the edge are all decided, the players bet for
the centre pool, or pochen. Any player with a pair, or three of a
kind, wishing to bet on them, puts as many counters as he pleases
into the centre pool, and any player willing to bet against him must
put in a like amount. There is no raising these bets, and the players
in order to the left of the dealer have the first say as to betting,
or passing. The higher pair wins. Threes beat pairs, and four of
a kind is the best hand possible.</p>

<p>This pool settled, the play of the cards follows. Eldest hand
leads any card he pleases and each in turn to the left must follow in
sequence and suit, playing the 10 on the 9, the J on the 10, etc.,
until the K is reached. The player who has the King, or the highest
card, if the King is in the stock, starts again with any card he
pleases. Any player who cannot continue the sequence in his turn
must pass that round.</p>

<p>As soon as one player gets rid of his last card the game is at an
end and every player at the table must pay him a counter for each
card held. The deal then passes to the left and the layout is
dressed for the next hand.</p>

<h3>RANTER GO ROUND.</h3>

<p>This is a round game for any number of players who make up a
pool or stake to be played for. A full pack of fifty-two cards is used
and each player has three markers. The dealer gives one card to
each, face down. This card is examined and if it is not satisfactory
it is passed to the player on the left, the object being to avoid
holding the lowest card at the table.</p>

<p>If the player on the left holds any card but a king, he is obliged
to exchange. If the one who is forced to exchange gives an ace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
or a deuce, he announces it; but the player who demands the exchange
is not allowed to say what he gives, as the card may be
passed on. Each player in turn to the left may exchange, or he
may pass, which means that he is satisfied with his card.</p>

<p>When it comes round to the dealer, he cannot exchange; but he
may cut the pack and take the top card. All the cards are then
turned face up, and the lowest shown loses a counter. The deal
passes to the left. When all the players but one have lost all their
markers, the survivor takes the pool.</p>

<h3>FIVE OR NINE.</h3>

<p>This game, which is sometimes called Domino Whist, is simply
Pope Joan or Matrimony without the layout. Any number of
persons may play, and the full pack of fifty-two cards is used, the
cards being dealt in proportion to the number of players, as at
Pope Joan.</p>

<p>The eldest hand must begin by laying out the Five or Nine of
some suit to start the first sequence. If he has neither of those
cards he must pass, and the first player on his left who has a Five
or a Nine must begin. The next player on the left must then continue
the sequence in the same suit if he can, but he may play
either up or down, laying the card on the right or left of the
starter. If a Five is led, he may play a Four or a Six. Only one
card is played at a time by each person in turn. Any person not
being able to continue the sequence may start another if he has
another Five, but he cannot start one with a Nine unless the first
starter in the game was a Nine. He is also at liberty to start a
new sequence with a Five or Nine instead of continuing the old,
but he must play if he can, one or the other. If he is unable to
play, he must pay one counter into the pool, which is won by the
first player who gets rid of all his cards. The winner is also paid
a counter for every card held by the other players.</p>

<h3>FAN TAN.</h3>

<p>This is the simplest form of Stops, and requires no layout.
Any number of players can take part, and a full pack of fifty-two
cards is used. The players cut for deal and seats, low having the
choice. Ace is low. The players are provided with an equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
number of counters, and before the cards are dealt, each places an
agreed number in the pool. All the cards are dealt out. If some
have more than others it does not matter.</p>

<p>The eldest hand begins by playing any card he pleases, and the
next player on his left must either play the card next above it, or
put one counter in the pool. Only one card is played at a time,
and after the sequence has arrived at the King it must be continued
with the ace, and go on until the suit is exhausted. The
person who plays the thirteenth card of any suit must start
another sequence, in any suit and with any card he pleases. The
player who first gets rid of all his cards takes the pool.</p>

<p>The great trick in this game is to provide for the last suit to be
played, and in order to have the selection of the second suit it is
usual for the eldest hand to begin with the higher of two cards
next in value to each other, which will make him the last player in
that suit. Each suit is turned face down as it is exhausted.</p>

<h3>SOLITAIRE.</h3>

<p>All games of Solitaire are played with the full pack of fifty-two
cards. The games may be roughly divided into two classes;
those in which the result is entirely dependent on chance, and cannot
be changed by the player after the cards have been shuffled
and cut; and those which present opportunities for judgment and
skill, the choice of several ways to the same end being offered to
the player at various stages of the game. The first class is of
course the simplest, but the least satisfactory, as it is nothing more
than a game of chance.</p>

<p>Of the many hundreds of patience games, it is possible to give
only a few of the best known.</p>

<p><i><b>TAKE TEN.</b></i> Shuffle and cut the cards, and deal out thirteen
face upward in two rows of five each, and one row of three.
Any two cards, the pip value of which equals 10, may be withdrawn
from the tableau, and others dealt from the top of the pack
in their places. Only two cards may be used to form a 10. The
K Q J 10 of each suit must be lifted together, none of these cards
being touched until all four of the same suit are on the table
together. When no cards can be lifted, the game is lost.</p>

<p>The object in most patience games is to arrange the cards in
sequences. An ascending sequence is one in which the cards run
from A 2 3 up to the King; and a descending sequence is one in
which they run down to the ace. Sequences may be formed of one
suit or of mixed suits, according to the rules of the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>THE CARPET.</b></i> Shuffle and cut the pack. Deal out
twenty cards in four rows of five cards each, face up. This is the
carpet. Any aces found in it are taken out and used to form a fifth
row, either at the bottom or the side. The holes made in the
carpet by removing the aces are then filled up from the pack.
Cards are then taken from the carpet to build upon the aces in
ascending sequence, following suit, and the holes in the carpet are
continually filled up with fresh cards from the top of the pack.
As other aces appear they are laid aside to start the sequence in
the suit to which they belong. When you are stopped, deal the
cards remaining in the pack in a pile on the table by themselves,
face upward. If any card appears which can be used in the
ascending sequences, take it, and if this enables you to make more
holes in the carpet, do so. But after having been driven to deal
this extra pile, holes in the carpet can no longer be filled from the
pack; they must be patched up with the top cards on the extra
pile until it is exhausted.</p>

<p><i><b>FOUR OF A KIND.</b></i> Shuffle and cut the pack, then deal
out thirteen cards face down in two rows of five each and one row
of three. Deal on the top of these until the pack is exhausted,
which will give you four cards in each pile, face down. Imagine
that these piles represent respectively the A 2 3 4 5 in the first
row; the 6 7 8 9 10 in the second, and the J Q K in the third.
Take the top card from the ace pile, turn it face upward, and
place it, still face upward, under the pile to which it belongs. If
it is a Jack, for instance, it will go face up under the first pile in
the third row. Then take the top card from the second pile, and
so on, keeping the left hand as a marker on the pile last drawn
from. When you come to a pile which is complete, all the cards
being face up, you can skip it, and go on to the next. If at the
end you find that the last card to be turned up lies on its proper
pile, and needs turning over only, you win; but if you have to
remove it to another pile, you lose.</p>

<p><i><b>TRY AGAIN.</b></i> Shuffle and cut the pack, and deal the cards
face upward into four heaps. You are not obliged to deal to each
pile in succession, but may place the cards on any of the four
piles, according to your judgment or pleasure. In dealing out in
this manner it is not good policy to cover one card with a higher,
unless you are compelled to do so. Every time you come to an
ace, separate it from the others, placing it in a new row, as a
foundation for an ascending sequence, which may be continued
regardless of the suit of the cards used. The top cards of the
four piles are used to build up the sequence. After an ace has
appeared, the player may examine the cards in any or all of the
piles, but their order must not be disturbed. The object in looking
at the cards is to select the pile which is least likely to stop
you, or the one having the fewest cards in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>TAKE FOURTEEN.</b></i> Shuffle and cut the pack, and deal
the cards one at a time, face upward, into twelve piles, and continue
dealing on the top of these twelve until the pack is exhausted.
This will give you four piles which contain one card more than
the others. Then take off any two of the top cards which will
make 14, reckoning the Jack as 11, the Queen as <i>12</i> and the King
as 13, all the others at their face value. Only two cards must be
used to make 14. If you succeed in taking off all the cards in
this manner, you win. You are at liberty to look at the underneath
cards in the various piles, but you must not disturb their
positions.</p>

<p><i><b>HELP YOUR NEIGHBOUR.</b></i> Take from the pack the
four aces, and lay them face upward on the table in a row. These
are to be built upon in ascending sequences, following suit. Shuffle
and cut the remaining forty-eight cards, and deal off four starters
in a row, below the aces. These cards are to be built down on,
in descending sequence, regardless of suit. The remainder of the
pack is then taken in the left hand, and the cards turned up one
by one from the top. Any card which can be used to build up on
the ace row, or down on the second row, is placed on its proper
pile at once. If the card is unavailable for either purpose, it must
be placed in a separate and ninth pile, known as the talon, or
deadwood. The ascending sequences may be built up from any
of the three sources; cards from the top of the pack, those on the
top of the various descending sequences, or those on the top of
the deadwood.</p>

<p>The top card in any descending sequence may be moved from
one pile to another, or a card may be taken from an ascending
sequence and placed on a descending, always provided that such
a card continues the sequence in the pile to which it is removed.
If any of the piles occupied by the descending sequences are exhausted,
new cards may be placed there at any time the player
thinks fit. Such new piles may be started from the pack, from
the deadwood, or from any other pile.</p>

<h3>KLONDIKE.</h3>

<p>This game is sometimes mistakenly called “Canfield”, but that
is a distinct game, described elsewhere, in which there are
separate piles for stock and foundations.</p>

<p>Shuffle the full pack of fifty-two cards, cut and turn up the top
card. Lay six more cards in a row to the right of the first card,
but all face down. Upon the second card of this row place another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
card face up, and then cards face down on the remaining five of the
top row. On the third pile from the left, place another card
face up, and then four more face down to the right. Continue this
until you have seven cards face up, which will give you twenty-eight
cards in your layout.</p>

<p>Take out any aces showing, and place them in a row by themselves
for “foundations.” Build up on these aces in sequence
and suit to kings. On the layout, build in descending sequence,
red on black, black on red, turning up the top card when any pile
is left without a faced card upon it. If there is more than one card
face up on any pile, they must be removed together or not at all.
Spaces may be filled only with kings.</p>

<p>The stock is run off three cards at a time, and any card showing
can be used. The pack can be run through in this manner until
no cards showing can be used, but there must be no shuffling or rearrangement
of the cards. Sometimes it is the rule to run through
the pack once only, turning up one card at a time.</p>

<p>The object of the game is to see how many cards can be built on
the ace row. A better average can usually be obtained when the
pack is run off three at a time with the privilege of running through
again and again as long as any card can be used.</p>

<h3>FORTUNE TELLING.</h3>

<p>Whatever the arrangement employed for laying out the tableau
in fortune telling, the result of the reading will always be dependent
on the person’s ability to string together in a connected story
the meanings which are attached to the various cards. According
to Eittella, the father of all fortune telling, only 32 cards should be
used, and it is essential that they should be single heads, because
a court card standing firmly on its feet is a very different thing
from one standing on its head. If single-head cards are not at
hand, the lower part of the double-head cards must be cancelled
in some manner.</p>

<p>The following are the interpretations of the various cards, the
initial <i><b>R</b></i> meaning that the card is reversed, or standing on its
head.</p>

<p><i><b>HEARTS.</b></i> Ace. The house, or home.</p>

<p>King. A benefactor. <i><b>R.</b></i> He will not be able to do you much
good, although he means well.</p>

<p>Queen. Everything that is lovely in woman. <i><b>R.</b></i> You will
have to wait awhile for the realization of your hopes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack. A person who may be useful to you. <i><b>R.</b></i> He will not
prove of much account.</p>

<p>Ten. A pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>Nine. Reconciliation.</p>

<p>Eight. Children.</p>

<p>Seven. A good marriage. <i><b>R.</b></i> Fair to middling.</p>

<p><i><b>CLUBS.</b></i> Ace. Profits from business or gambling.</p>

<p>King. A just man, who has taken a fancy to you. <i><b>R.</b></i> Something
will interfere with his good intentions.</p>

<p>Queen. Your best girl. <i><b>R.</b></i> She is jealous.</p>

<p>Jack. A probable marriage. <i><b>R.</b></i> It may have to be postponed.</p>

<p>Ten. Success in business. If followed by ♢ 9, the note will not
be paid when it is due; if followed by the ♠ 9 you will lose the entire
account.</p>

<p>Nine. Success in love.</p>

<p>Eight. Great anticipations.</p>

<p>Seven. Trifling love affairs. <i><b>R.</b></i> They will get you into
trouble.</p>

<p><i><b>DIAMONDS.</b></i> Ace. A letter, or a written notice.</p>

<p>King. A person to beware of. <i><b>R.</b></i> Will annoy you in any case.</p>

<p>Queen. A shrew or gossip. <i><b>R.</b></i> She will make you tired.</p>

<p>Jack. A bearer of bad news. <i><b>R.</b></i> Worse than you expected.</p>

<p>Ten. An unexpected journey.</p>

<p>Nine. That expected money will not come to hand.</p>

<p>Eight. Some surprising actions on the part of a young man.</p>

<p>Seven. Success in lotteries, gambling or speculation. <i><b>R.</b></i> The
amount will be very small.</p>

<p><i><b>SPADES.</b></i> Ace. Love affairs.</p>

<p>King. Police or sheriffs. <i><b>R.</b></i> Loss of a lawsuit.</p>

<p>Queen. A gay and deceptive widow. <i><b>R.</b></i> She’s fooling thee.</p>

<p>Jack. Disagreeable young man. <i><b>R.</b></i> He will do you an injury
or injustice of some kind.</p>

<p>Ten. Prison.</p>

<p>Nine. Vexatious delays in business matters.</p>

<p>Eight. Bad news. If followed by the ♢ 7, quarrels.</p>

<p>Seven. Quarrels which will be lasting unless the card is followed
by some hearts. <i><b>R.</b></i> Family rows.</p>

<p><i><b>COMBINATIONS.</b></i> 4 aces, death; 3 aces, dissipation; 2
aces, enmity.</p>

<p>4 Kings, honours; 3 Kings, success in business; 2 Kings, good
advice.</p>

<p>4 Queens, scandal; 3 Queens, dissipation; 2 Queens, friendship.</p>

<p>4 Jacks, contagious diseases; 3 Jacks, idleness; 2 Jacks, quarrels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span></p>

<p>4 Tens, disagreeable events; 3 Tens, change of residence; 2
Tens, loss.</p>

<p>4 Nines, good actions; 3 Nines, imprudence; 2 Nines, money.</p>

<p>4 Eights, reverses in business or love; 3 Eights, marriage; 2
Eights, trouble.</p>

<p>4 Sevens, intrigues; 3 Sevens, pleasure; 2 Sevens, small affairs
and gossip.</p>

<p><i><b>THE CONSULTATION.</b></i> There are several ways of telling
fortunes, but one example will suffice. The most important
thing is to know what your client wants to be told, and the next
is to be sure that she cuts the cards with her left hand.</p>

<p>The cards are shuffled, presented to be cut, and then counted
off into sevens, every seventh card being laid face up on the table,
the six intermediates being placed on the bottom of the pack each
time. When twelve cards have been obtained in this manner,
they are laid out in a row, and examined to see if the card representing
the questioner is among them. If not, they must be
gathered, shuffled, cut, and dealt again. A married man with
light hair would be the ♢ K, with dark hair, the ♣ K. If he claims
to be single, the ♡ J. If your client is a woman, the ♡ Q will do
for blondes, the ♣ Q for brunettes. Do not ask if she is married,
and take no notice of rings.</p>

<p>Having obtained the necessary twelve cards, the more you know
about the consultant’s history, hopes, and prospects, and the better
you can judge her character, the less attention you need pay to
the cards, and the more satisfactory the result of the consultation
will be. It is not necessary to stick too closely to the meanings
of the cards, nor to their combinations; the great thing is to tell
your client what she wants to hear.</p>

<p>In order to confirm the truth of the pleasing story you have
built upon the twelve cards, they must be gathered together,
shuffled, presented to be cut with the left hand, and then divided
into four packets of three cards each. The first packet is for the
Person, the second for the House, the third for the Future, and
the fourth for the Surprise. Each packet is successively turned up,
and its contents interpreted in connection with the part of the
questioner’s life which it represents. In case there should be
nothing very surprising in the last pack, it is well to have a few
generalities on hand, which will be true of a person’s future six
times out of ten. The expert at fortune telling has a stock of
vague suggestions, supposed to be given by the cards, which are
so framed as to draw from the client the drift of her hopes and
fears. The scent once found, most of the fortune telling is in the
nature of confirming the client’s own views of the situation. Nevertheless,
when well done, by a good talker, fortune telling is very
amusing, especially in a small company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="BANKING_GAMES">BANKING GAMES.</h2>

<p>There are two distinct classes of banking games; those that
can be played without any apparatus but a pack of cards and some
counters; and those which require a permanent establishment and
expensive paraphernalia. Among the first, probably the best
known banking games are: Vingt-et-un, Baccara, Blind Hookey,
and Fan Tan, the latter requiring only one card, the face of which
is never seen. In the second class, which are often called table
games, probably the best known are: Faro, Keno, Roulette,
Rouge et Noir, and Chuck Luck.</p>

<p>Each of these games has a number of offshoots, and the distinctions
between the original and the variation are sometimes so
minute as to be hardly worth mentioning. As a matter of reference,
and for the convenience of those who hear these variations
spoken of, their names and chief characteristics are here given.</p>

<p>Banking games, properly so-called, are those in which one
player is continually opposed to all the others. In round games,
each player is for himself, but no player is selected for the common
enemy. In partnership games, the sides are equally divided,
and any advantage in the deal or lead passes alternately from one
to the other. In other games, the single player that may be opposed
to two or three others usually takes the responsibility upon
himself, and for one deal only, so that any advantage he may have
is temporary. In banking games, on the contrary, one player is
selected as opposed to all others, and the opposition is continual.
If there is any advantage in being the banker, it is supposed to be
a permanent one, and if the banker has not been at any special
expense in securing the advantages of his position he is obliged
to surrender it from time to time and give other players a chance.
This is the rule in Vingt-et-un, Baccara, and Blind Hookey. If
the banker is not changed occasionally, he retains his position on
account of the expense he has been put to to provide the apparatus
for the play, as in Faro, Keno, Roulette, and Rouge et Noir. To
justify this expenditure he must have some permanent advantage,
and if no such advantage or “percentage” is inherent in the
principles of the game, any person playing against such a banker
is probably being cheated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>At Monte Carlo, everything is perfectly fair and straightforward,
but no games are played except those in which the percentage in
favour of the bank is evident, and is openly acknowledged. In
Faro there is no such advantage, and no honest faro bank can
live. It is for that reason that the game is not played at Monte
Carlo, in spite of the many thousands of Americans who have
begged the management to introduce it. The so-called percentage
of “splits” at Faro is a mere sham, and any candid dealer will
admit that they do not pay for the gas. Roulette, Rouge et Noir,
Keno, and Chuck Luck are all percentage games, although the
banker in the latter is seldom satisfied with his legitimate gains.</p>

<p>The peculiarity about all percentage banking games is that no
system, as a system, will beat them. The mathematical expectation
of loss is so nicely adjusted to the probabilities of gain that
the player must always get just a little the worst of it if he will
only play long enough. Take any system of martingales, and
suppose for the sake of illustration that in 1000 coups you will win
180 counters. The mathematical expectation of the game is such
that just about once in a thousand coups your martingale will carry
you to a point in which you will lose 200 counters, leaving you just
20 behind on every 1000 if you keep on playing. Every system
has been carefully investigated, and enormous labour has been
expended on the compilation of tables recording for a long series
of time every number rolled at Roulette, and every coup raked in
at Rouge et Noir, and the result of all systems is found to be the
same, the bank succeeds in building up its percentage like a coral
island, while the player’s money disappears like water in the sand.</p>

<h3>VINGT-ET-UN.</h3>

<p>Any number of persons may play Vingt-et-un, and a full pack
of fifty-two cards is used. The <i><b>cards</b></i> have no rank, but a counting
value is attached to each, the ace being reckoned as 11 or 1, at
the option of the holder, all court cards as 10 each, and the others
at their face value.</p>

<p>The cards are thrown round for the first deal, and the first ace
takes it. The dealer is also the banker. Each player is provided
with a certain number of <i><b>counters</b></i>, usually 25 or 50, and a betting
limit is agreed on before play begins. The players on the
dealer’s right and left are known as the pone and the eldest hand
respectively.</p>

<p>The <i><b>object</b></i> of the game is to get as near 21 as possible in the
total pip value of the cards held.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Stakes.</b></i> Before the cards are dealt, each player except the
dealer places before him the amount he bets upon his chances for
that deal. This amount may be either at the option of the player,
within the betting limit, or it may be a fixed sum, such as one
counter. In one variation each player is allowed to look at the
first card dealt him before making his bet, and before receiving a
second card. When it comes to the dealer’s turn, he does not
stake anything upon his card, but he has the privilege of calling
upon all the others to <i><b>double</b></i> the amount they have placed on
theirs. Any player refusing to double must pass over to the
dealer the stake already put up, and stand out of the game for that
hand.</p>

<p>Another variation is to allow any player whose second card is of
the same denomination as the first to separate them, and to place
upon the second card a bet equal in amount to that upon his first
card, afterward drawing to each separately, as if they were two
different hands.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> The bets made, the cards are shuffled and presented
to the pone to be cut; four must be left in each packet.
Two cards are given to each player, including the dealer, one at a
time in two rounds. If the dealer gives too many cards to any
player, either in the first deal or in the draw, he must correct the
error at once. If the player has seen the superfluous card he may
keep any two he chooses of those dealt him. If the dealer gives
himself too many he must keep them all. The last card in the
pack must not be dealt. If there are not enough cards to supply
the players, the discards must be gathered up, shuffled together,
and cut.</p>

<p><i><b>Naturals.</b></i> The cards all dealt, the dealer first examines his
hand. If he has exactly 21, an Ace and a tenth card, which is
called a natural, he shows it at once, and the players must pay
him twice the amount they have staked in front of them, unless
they also have a natural, when it is a stand-off. If the dealer has
not a natural, each player in turn, beginning with the eldest hand,
examines his two cards to see how nearly their total value approaches
21. If he has a natural, he exposes it immediately, and
the dealer must pay him double the amount staked. It is sometimes
the rule for the holder of a natural, the dealer having none,
to take the stakes of all the other players; but this variation is not
in favour.</p>

<p><i><b>Drawing.</b></i> No natural being shown, each player in turn may
draw another card, or stand on the two dealt him, which are not
shown under any circumstances. If he is content, he says: “I
stand.” If he wants a card he says: “One,” and the dealer gives
it to him, face up. If the pips on the card drawn, added to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
already in his hand, make his total greater than 21, he is créve, and
passes over to the dealer his stake, throwing his cards in the centre
of the table, still face down. If the total is not 21, he may draw another
card, and so on until he is créve or stands. The first player
disposed of in this manner, the dealer goes on to the next one, and
so on until he comes to himself. He turns his two cards face upward,
and draws or stands to suit himself. If he overdraws, all
the other players expose their first two cards to show that they
have 21 or less, and he then pays each of them the amount they
have staked. If he stands, either before or after drawing, the others
expose their cards in the same way, and those that have the same
number are tied, and win or lose nothing. Those who have less
than the dealer lose their stake; those that have more than the
dealer, but still not more than 21, he must pay. When the result
is a tie, it is called <i><b>paying in cards</b></i>.</p>

<p><i><b>The Banker.</b></i> The banker for the next deal may be decided
upon in various ways. The old rule was for one player to continue
to act as banker and to deal the cards until one of his adversaries
held a natural, the dealer having none to offset it. When
this occurred, the player who held the natural took the bank and
the deal until some one else held a natural. Another way was to
agree upon a certain number of rounds for a banker, after which
the privilege was drawn for again. Another was for one player to
remain the banker until he had lost or won a certain amount, when
the privilege was drawn for again. The modern practice is for
each player to be the banker in turn, the deal passing in regular
rotation to the left. When this is done there must be a penalty
for dealing twice in succession, and it is usually fixed at having to
pay ties, if the error is not discovered until one player has drawn
cards. If before that, it is a misdeal.</p>

<p><i><b>Pools.</b></i> Vingt-et-un is sometimes played with a pool. Each
player contributes one counter at the start, and the pool is afterward
fed by penalties. Every player who is créve puts in a counter;
all ties with the dealer pay one, and the dealer pays one for
any irregularity in dealing. The pool may be kept to pay for refreshments,
like the kitty in Poker, or it may be won by the first
natural shown, as may be agreed.</p>

<p><i><b>Probabilities.</b></i> The only point in the game is for a player to
know what hands to stand on, and what to draw to. The dealer
is guided by the cards dealt to other players, and by what they
ask for. The other players should stand on 17, but draw on 16.
In practice it has been found that the odds are about 2 to 1 in
favour of drawing at 16; 3 to 1 for drawing at 15. The rules for
drawing, etc., are more fully described in connection with the very
similar game of Baccara.</p>

<h3>MACAO.</h3>

<p>In this variety of Vingt-et-un only one card is dealt to each
player; court cards and tens count nothing, and the Ace is always
worth one. The number to be reached is 9, instead of 21, and if
a player has a 9 natural, he receives from the banker three times
his stake; if an 8 natural, he receives double, and for a 7 natural,
he is paid. If the banker has an equal number of points natural,
it is a tie; and if the banker has a 7, 8, or 9 natural he receives
from each of the others once, twice, or three times the amount of
their stakes. If none of these naturals are shown, the players
draw in turn, as at Vingt-et-un, and the dealer receives from those
who have less points than he, or who are créve, and pays those
who have more, but have not passed 9.</p>

<h3>FARMER.</h3>

<p>Any number of persons may play. All the 8’s and all the 6’s
but the ♡6 are discarded from a pack of fifty-two cards. All
court cards count for 10, the ace for 1, and all others at their face
value. A pool is then made up by each player contributing one
counter. This is the farm, and it is sold to the highest bidder,
who must put into it the price he pays for it. He then becomes
the farmer, and deals one card to each player, but takes none himself.</p>

<p>The object of the players is to get as near 16 as possible, and
each in turn, beginning on the dealer’s left must take at least one
card. After looking at it he may ask for another, and so on until
he is créve or stands. Should a player overdraw himself, he says
nothing about it until all are helped, when the hands are exposed.
Any player having exactly 16 takes the farm and all its contents.
If there is more than one 16, that which is made with the assistance
of the ♡6 wins, otherwise the one which is made with the
fewest cards. If this is a tie the eldest hand wins. If no one has
exactly 16, the farm stays with its original owner deal after deal,
until exactly 16 is held by some player.</p>

<p>Whether any one wins the farm or not, when the hands are exposed
all those who have overdrawn must pay to the one who
owned the farm at the beginning of that deal, as many counters
as they have points more than 16. These payments do not go into
the farm, but are clear profits. Those who have less than 16 pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
nothing to the farmer; but the one who is nearest 16 receives a
counter from each of the others. Ties are decided by the possession
of the ♡ 6, or the fewest cards, or the eldest hand, as already
described. If the farm remains in the same hands, the farmer
deals again, and collects his profits until he loses his farm. When
the farm is won, it is emptied, and resold as in the beginning.</p>

<h3>QUINZE.</h3>

<p>This is a form of Vingt-et-un for two players, but the number
to be reached is 15 instead of 21. Court cards are reckoned as 10,
and the ace as 1 only. Each player stakes an agreed amount
every time, and the dealer then gives one card to his adversary
and one to himself. The pone may stand on the first card, or
draw; but he does not say anything if he overdraws. The dealer
then draws or stands, and both show their cards. The one nearest
to 15 wins; but if the result is a tie, or if both have overdrawn,
the stakes are doubled, and another hand is dealt, the deal passing
from player to player in rotation.</p>

<h3>BACCARA.</h3>

<p>This very popular variation of Vingt-et-un originated in the
south of France, and came into vogue during the latter part of the
reign of Louis Philippe. It is neither a recreation nor an intellectual
exercise, but simply a means for the rapid exchange of money,
well suited to persons of impatient temperament. The word
“Baccara” is supposed to mean “nothing,” or “zero,” and is
applied to the hands in which the total pip value of the cards ends
with a cypher.</p>

<p>There are two forms of the game in common use; Baccara a
deux tableaux, and Baccara chemin de fer. The first will be first
described.</p>

<p><i><b>Players.</b></i> Baccara may be played by any number of persons
from three to eleven. Those first in the room have the preference,
and should immediately inscribe their names. The first eleven
form the table, and the privilege of being the banker is sold to the
highest bidder; that is, to the one that will put up the most
money to be played for. The remaining ten persons draw for
choice of seats at the table, the first choice being for the seat immediately
on the right of the banker, then for the first seat on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
left. Five players are arranged on each side of the banker in this
manner, right and left alternately, according to the order of their
choice. Sometimes an assistant or croupier is seated opposite the
banker, to watch the bets, gather and shuffle the cards, etc. A
waste basket is placed in the centre of the table for the reception
of cards that have been used in play.</p>

<p>If no one bids for the bank, it must be offered to the first on the
list of players; if he declines, the next, and so on. The amount
bid for the bank is placed on the table, and none of it can be withdrawn,
all winnings being added to it. If no bid is made, the
banker may place on the table any amount he thinks proper, and
that amount, or what remains of it after each coup, is the betting
limit. When the banker loses all he has, the bank is sold to the
next highest bidder, or offered to the next player on the list. If
the banker wishes at any time to retire, the person taking his
place should begin with an amount equal to that then in the bank.</p>

<p><i><b>Counters.</b></i> Each of the players should be provided with a certain
number of counters, all of which must be sold and redeemed
by the banker or his assistant.</p>

<p><i><b>Cards.</b></i> Three packs of fifty-two cards each are shuffled together
and used as one. The players shuffle as much as they
please, the banker last, and the banker then presents them to any
player he pleases to have them cut. The banker may burn one or
two cards if he pleases; that is, turn them face upward on the
bottom of the pack.</p>

<p><i><b>Object of the Game.</b></i> The court cards and Tens count nothing,
but all others, including the Ace, are reckoned at their face
value. The object is to secure cards whose total pip value will
most closely approach the number 8 or 9. An 8 made with
two cards is better than a 9 made with three.</p>

<p><i><b>Stakes.</b></i> Each player in turn, beginning with the first one on
the right of the banker, and after him the first one on the left, and
so on, right and left alternately, can bet any amount he pleases until
the total amount bet equals the capital then in the bank. When
this amount is reached it is useless to place further bets, as they
may not be paid. For this reason Baccara is a very slow game
when there is not much money in the bank. After all the players
have made what bets they wish, outsiders may place bets on the
result if they choose to do so.</p>

<p>Either the players or the gallery may bet on either side of the
table, which is divided down the middle by a line dividing it into
two parts, right and left; hence the name, Baccara a deux tableaux.
A person wishing to bet on both sides at once places his money
<i><b>à cheval</b></i>; that is, across the line. If one side wins and the other
loses, a bet placed in this manner is a stand-off; if both sides lose,
the bet is lost, and if both win the bet is won. A common form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
of dishonesty at Baccara, and one for which a distinguished Englishman
was recently tried, is to place a stake very close to the line,
and if it is seen that the side on which it is placed has probably
lost, to push the stake onto the line, so that it may be saved if the
other side wins. The Englishman in question worked this little
game on the Prince of Wales for some time before he was
detected.</p>

<p>When the banker loses, he pays the players in their order, right
and left alternately, beginning with those who hold cards, until his
capital is exhausted. Any further bets are disregarded. If any
player bets on the opposite side of the table to that on which he is
seated, his bet is not paid until all five of the players on that side
have been settled with, because such a bet is regarded as that of
an outsider, not belonging to that side of the table. If the player
actually holding cards is not the one nearest the banker, he is still
the first one to be paid, and then those beyond him in order. For
instance: The third player holds cards; after him the fourth and
fifth are paid, and then the first and second, each alternately with
a player on the other side of the table.</p>

<p><i><b>Banco.</b></i> Each player in turn, beginning with the one to whom
cards will be dealt first, has the right to go banco; that is, to challenge
the banker to play for his entire capital at a single coup. Such a
proposition takes precedence of all others. If the bank loses such a
coup, it must be put up to the highest bidder again, or offered to
the next player on the list. If it wins, the same player, or any
other player, may make a similar offer for the next coup, which
will now be for double the first amount, of course; but no player
is allowed to offer banco more than twice in succession.</p>

<p><i><b>Dealing.</b></i> The cards cut, the banker takes a convenient number
of them in his hand, or better, spreads them face downward on
the table, and slips off the top card, giving it to the player next
him on the right, face down. The next card he gives to the player
on his left, and the next to himself. He gives another card to the
right, to the left, and to himself, and then the players take them up
and examine them. Ten cards must remain in the stock for the
last deal.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities.</b></i> After the first card is dealt no bets can be
made or changed. The cards must be so held that they shall be at
all times in full view of the players. Any card found faced in the
pack is thrown in the waste basket. Any card once separated
from the pack must be taken. If neither of the players want it,
the dealer must take it himself. If the cards are dealt irregularly
the error may be rectified if they have not been looked at; but any
player may amend or withdraw his bet before the cards are seen.
If the error is not detected in time, the player who holds cards
may play the coup or not as he pleases, and all bets on his side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
the table are bound by his decision. If a player holds one card too
many, he may refuse the coup, or retain whichever two of the three
cards he pleases, throwing the third into the waste basket, not
showing it. If the banker has too many cards, the players may
amend their bets, and the banker’s cards are then exposed, and the
one taken from him which will leave him with the smallest point,
the drawn card being thrown in the waste basket. If the banker
gives himself two cards while either player has been given one
only, the player must be given another card, and the banker must
also take another. If the players have not amended their stake
before the error was corrected, the first two cards dealt to the
banker are thrown in the waste basket, and the third is his point
for that deal. If the banker gives the second card to either
player before dealing the first to himself, he must give the second
to the other player also, and then take his own. This single card
must then be thrown in the waste basket, but the banker may play
out the hand as if he had two cards which counted 10 or 20; that
is, baccara.</p>

<p><i><b>Showing.</b></i> If any of the three persons holding cards finds he
has a point of 8 or 9, it must be shown at once, and the two other
hands are then exposed. If the banker has 8 or 9, and neither of
the others has so many, the bank wins everything on the table.
If either player has more than the banker, all the bets on that side
of the table must be paid. If either player has as many as the
banker, all the bets on that side of the table are a stand-off. If
either player has less than the banker, all the bets on that side of
the table are lost. If a player wrongly announces 8 or 9, he cannot
draw cards unless his point was 10 or 20.</p>

<p><i><b>Drawing.</b></i> If none of the three can show 8 or 9, the banker
must offer a card to the player on his right. The card must be
slipped off the pack and offered face down. If the player on the
right refuses, it is offered to the player on the left, and if he also
refuses, the banker must take it himself. If the player on the
right takes it, the player on the left may ask for a card also; but
whether he does so or not, the banker is not obliged to draw unless
he chooses, after the first card offered has been taken by
either player. When the card is taken it is turned face up, and
left on the table in front of the person to whom it belongs. Only
one card may be drawn by any player, and all the hands are then
exposed. Ties are a stand-off. The banker pays all bets on the
side that is nearer 9 than himself, and wins all on the side which
is not so near 9 as himself. The players on the opposite sides of
the table have nothing to do with each other; each wins or loses
with the banker alone.</p>

<p>It should be observed that if a player had 4 originally, and draws
a 9, his point is not 13, but 3, because all 10’s count for nothing.
There is no such thing as being créve, as at Vingt-et-un.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities.</b></i> If the banker gives two cards, face up, to
the player on his right, the player may retain which he pleases,
throwing the other into the waste basket. If two cards are given
to the player on the left, he may select which he pleases, and the
banker must take the other.</p>

<p><i><b>Order of Playing.</b></i> The coup finished, and all bets paid,
the cards which have been used are all thrown into the waste
basket, and the stakes are placed for the next coup. The banker
deals again, from the top of the stock, without any further shuffling
or cutting of the cards. If the player on the right won the
first coup, the banker deals to him again; but if he lost, the
banker deals to the next player beyond him; that is, the second
from the banker, on his right. The same with the player on the
left. If the player on the right or left wins the second coup, the
cards are dealt to him again for the third coup; if he loses they
are dealt to the next player beyond him, and so on, until all five
players have held cards and have lost a coup, after which the
banker deals to the one nearest him again.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that there are in each coup only two active
players, and that all stakes made upon the game are made upon
the result of their hands.</p>

<p><i><b>Suggestions for Playing.</b></i> In justice to those backing him,
the player is supposed to draw or not to draw, according to the
laws of probabilities, which are exactly the same as in Vingt-et-un.
If he has four points, which would be 5 below 9, he should draw;
just as he would if he had 16 at Vingt-et-un, which would be 5
below 21. If he has 5 or more, he should stand; but if he has 5
exactly it is a matter of judgment, drawing a card being sometimes
good play, especially if it is likely to lead the banker to overdraw
himself. In some clubs there is a law that a player must draw if
his point is less than 5, and must stand if it is more than 5, or he
must pay a fine.</p>

<p>As no one is backing the banker, he is at liberty to play as badly
as he pleases, and he is really the only one that has an opportunity
to exercise any judgment in the matter of drawing. If a player
refuses a card, the banker may be able to judge whether or not he
has 6 or 7 by his habit of drawing or not drawing at 5. If he is
known to be a player who draws at 5, it is useless for the banker
to stand at 5, unless he thinks he can beat the player on the other
side of the table, and there is more money on that side. If the
player demanding a card has been given a 10, the banker should
stand, even at 3 or 4. If he has been given an ace, the banker
should stand at 4; if a 2 or 3, the banker should stand at 5; if the
player is given a 4, the banker should draw, even if he has 5. If
a player has drawn a 5, 6 or 7, the banker should draw, even if he
has 5 or 6. If the player draws an 8 or 9, the banker should stand
at 4 or 5, sometimes even with 3.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be remembered that the banker should have a sharp eye
to the relative amounts staked on each side of the table, which
will often decide which player he should try to beat. For example:
The banker has 5, and the player on his right has drawn a
10, the one on his left a 7. The banker has an excellent chance to
win all the bets on the right, and should have a certainty of
standing off with them, and unless those on the left very much exceeded
them, the banker would be very foolish to risk losing everything
by drawing to 5, simply to beat the player on his left.</p>

<p><i><b>BACCARA CHEMIN DE FER.</b></i> In this variation,
each player in turn on the left becomes the banker, taking the deal
as soon as the first banker loses a coup. The banker gives cards
only to the player on his right, and to himself. If this player will
not go banco, each of the others in order beyond him may do so. If
no one goes banco, each player in turn to the right makes what
bets he pleases, within the limit of the bank’s capital. If the
banker wins the coup, he deals again, and so on until he loses,
when the deal passes to the player on his left. The banker, after
winning a coup, may pass the deal to the player on his right, if he
chooses to do so, provided that player will put up an amount
equal to that then in the bank. When this player loses a coup,
the bank must go to the player to whom it would have gone in
regular order; that is, the one on the left of the player who transferred
his privilege.</p>

<p>Six packs of cards are generally used in Chemin de Fer, and the
cards are placed in a wooden box, from which each dealer takes
as many as he wants.</p>

<p><i><b>CHEATING.</b></i> Baccara is honeycombed with trickery. Dishonest
players, in collusion with the banker, have certain means of
informing him of their point, so that he may win all the money
staked upon that side of the table by the other players. This may
be done in many ways. The player may ask the one sitting next
him whether or not he should draw, which shows that he has 5.
Or he may make a movement as if to expose his first two cards, and
then correct himself. This shows the banker that the player has
baccara, and is pretending that he thought he had 9. In addition
to this system of communication, which Parisians call tiquer,
marked cards, second dealing, and prepared stocks which can be
palmed on the true cards, or substituted therefor, are all in common
use. If Baccara is honestly played it is one of the fairest of
all banking games, but the opportunities for cheating are so many
and so easily availed of, and the money to be won and lost is so
great, especially at Chemin de Fer, that few who know anything of
cheating at cards can resist the temptation to practice it at Baccara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>The Laws</b></i> of Baccara are very long and complicated. As no
official code exists, and as each gambling club makes its own house
rules, it is not necessary to give them here, the directions contained
in the foregoing description being sufficient for any honest
game.</p>

<h3>BLIND HOOKEY.</h3>

<p>This game is sometimes called Dutch Bank. Any number of
persons may play, and a full pack of fifty-two cards is used. The
cards rank from the A K Q down to the deuce. Any player may
shuffle, the dealer last. The pack is then cut, and the reunited
parts are placed in the centre of the table. The players then cut
it into several packets, none less than four cards, all of which
remain on the table face down. Some player then pushes one of
the packets toward the dealer, and bets are then made on the
others. Any player, except the dealer, can bet what he pleases on
any packet.</p>

<p>After all the bets are made all the packets, including the dealer’s,
are turned face up, exposing the bottom card of each. Any
packet disclosing a card lower than the dealer’s loses all bets
placed upon it. Any packet showing a card better than the
dealer’s wins from him. The dealer takes all ties. The deal
then passes to the next player on the left. Sometimes only three
packets are cut, one of which is pushed to the dealer.</p>

<p>This game is a great favourite with card-sharpers, especially on
ocean steamers. They use packs in which the cards are trimmed
long and short, so that a confederate may cut them by the ends or
by the sides for high or low cards, afterward pushing one of the
high cuts toward the dealer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHINESE FAN TAN.</h3>

<p>This is apparently the fairest of all banking games, there being
absolutely no percentage in favour of the banker except that the
players have to do the guessing.</p>

<p>The one who is willing to put up the largest amount of money
to be played for is usually selected as the banker. He is provided
with a large bowlful of beans, counters, buttons, small coins, or
some objects of which a large number of similar size and shape
can be easily obtained. An oblong card is placed in the centre of
the table, and the players stake their money upon its corners or
upon its edges. These corners are supposed to be numbered in
rotation from 1 to 4, the figure 1 being on the right of the banker.</p>

<p>A bet placed on any of the corners takes in the number it is
placed upon and the next higher also; so that a bet upon the corner
1 would be upon the numbers 1 and 2; upon 2 it would be
upon 2 and 3; and upon 4 it would be upon 4 and 1.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/p528a.jpg" width="200" height="100" alt="Diagram of the card" />
</div>

<p>In the illustration the bet would be upon 2 and 3.</p>

<p>If the bet is placed upon the edge of the card, it takes in the
next higher number only.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/p528b.jpg" width="200" height="100" alt="Diagram of the card" />
</div>

<p>In the illustration the bet is upon the number 2, and no other.</p>

<p>After all the bets have been placed, the banker takes a large
handful of the beans or counters from the bowl, and places them
on the table, counting them off rapidly into fours. The number
of odd counters remaining decides which number wins; if none
remain, 4 wins. If there were 2 or 3 counters over, the banker
would pay all bets on the corners 1 and 2, even money. If there
were 2 over, he would pay all bets on the edge of the card between
1 and 2 at the rate of three for one, and so on. The counters
are then returned to the bowl, and bets are placed for another
coup.</p>

<p>Sometimes the banker will draw a handful of beans from the
bowl and place them upon the table, covering them with a saucer
or with his cap. He then bets any player that there will be 1, 2,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
3, or 4 left, the player taking his choice, and being paid three for
one if he guesses correctly.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that this game is apparently perfectly fair
for all concerned, the author has never seen an American who
could win anything at it while a Chinaman was the banker.</p>

<h3>FARO.</h3>

<p>This is one of the oldest banking games, and is supposed to be
of Italian origin. It belongs to the same family as Lansquenet,
Florentini, and Monte Bank. Under the name of Pharaon, it was
in great favour during the reign of Louis XIV., and came to
America by way of New Orleans. As originally played, the dealer
held the cards in his left hand, and any bets once put down could
not again be taken up until they were decided. In addition to
splits, the dealer took hockelty.</p>

<p>As now played, Faro requires extensive and costly apparatus,
the engraved counters used being often worth more than their
playing value.</p>

<p>A full pack of fifty-two cards is shuffled and cut by the dealer,
and then placed face upward in a dealing box, the top of which is
open. The cards are drawn from this box in couples, by pushing
them one at a time through a slit in the side. As the cards are
withdrawn in this manner a spring pushes the remainder of the
pack upward. The first card in sight at the beginning of each
deal is called <i><b>soda</b></i>, and the last card left in the box is <i><b>in hoc</b></i>.</p>

<p>The first card withdrawn is placed about six inches from the
box, and the second is laid close to the box itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/p529.jpg" width="250" height="80" alt="Two cards and a box" />
</div>

<p>Every two cards withdrawn in this manner are called a <i><b>turn</b></i>,
and there are twenty-five turns in each deal, Soda and Hoc being
dead cards. In making the first turn, the Soda begins the pile
farther from the box, and the next card taken out is called a
<i><b>loser</b></i>, which is placed close to the box. The card left face upward
in the box is the <i><b>winner</b></i> for that turn, so that there must
be a winner and a loser for every turn; the loser outside the box,
and the winner left in it. On the next and all following turns, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
winning card on the previous turn will be placed on the same pile
as the Soda, so that it shall be possible at any time to decide which
cards have won, and which have lost.</p>

<p>The <i><b>Object of the Game</b></i> is for the players to guess whether
the various cards on which they place their money will win or
lose. They are at liberty to select any card they please, from the
ace to the King, and to bet any amount within the established
limit of the bank.</p>

<p><i><b>The Layout.</b></i> All bets are made with counters of various
colors and values, which are sold to the players by the dealer, and
may be redeemed at any time. These counters are placed on the
layout, which is a complete suit of spades, enamelled on green
cloth, sufficient space being left between the cards for the players
to place their bets. The ace is on the dealer’s left.</p>

</div>

<p>There are a great many ways of placing bets at Faro. For instance:
A player may make bets covering twenty-one different
combinations of cards, all of which would play the Ten to win, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;">
<img src="images/p530b.jpg" width="460" height="250" alt="The layout of the cards and counters" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span></p>

<p>If the first bet is supposed to be flat upon the Ten itself, 2, 3
and 4 would take in the card next the Ten; 5 the cards on each
side with the Ten; 6 and 7 the three cards behind which the bets
are placed, the Ten being one in each instance; 8 and 9 take in
the Ten and the card one remove from it in either direction; 10
and 11 are the same thing, but placed on the other card; 12 to 17
inclusive take in the various triangles of which the bet is the middle
card; 18 and 19 take in the four cards surrounding them; 20
and 21 are <i><b>heeled</b></i> bets, the bottom counter being flat on the corner
of the card, and the remainder being tilted over toward the
card diagonally across from the one on which the bet is placed,
playing both cards to win. In addition to these twenty-one bets,
others might be made by heeling bets that would take certain
cards to lose, and the Ten to win. Bets may also be <i><b>strung</b></i> behind
odd or even cards on the side next the dealer. These show
that the player bets the next case card that comes will win if it
is an even card, and lose if it is odd; that is, if he places his string
behind an even card.</p>

<p>If the player thinks a card will win, he bets it <i><b>open</b></i>, that is, with
nothing but his counters. If he wants to play a card to lose, he
<i><b>coppers</b></i> it, by placing a checker or button on his chips. If a
player wishes to reach two cards widely separated, such as the
deuce and Seven, and has not money enough to bet on both; he
can ask the dealer for a <i><b>marker</b></i>, which is a flat oblong piece of
ivory. This is placed on the card to be played with the same
money, and the dealer may either trust his memory for the bet, or
place another marker on it.</p>

<p>After the dealer has waved his hand preparatory to pushing the
top card from the box, no bet can be made or changed. After
the turn is made, the dealer first picks up all the bets he wins, and
then pays all he loses, after which he waits for the players to rearrange
their bets for the next turn. Between each turn a player
may make any change he pleases. A lookout sits on the right of
the dealer to see that he pays and takes correctly, and to watch
that no bets are changed, or coppers slipped off, during the turn.</p>

<p><i><b>Splits.</b></i> If two cards of the same denomination win and lose
on the same turn, it is a split, and the dealer takes half the bets
on the split card, no matter whether it is bet to win or lose. Splits
should come about three times in two deals if the cards are honestly
dealt.</p>

<p><i><b>Keeping Cases.</b></i> As the cards are withdrawn from the box
they are marked on a case-keeper, which is a suit of thirteen cards,
with four buttons running on a steel rod opposite each of them.
As the cards come out, these buttons are pushed along, so that
the player may know how many of each card are still to come, and
what cards are left in for the last turn. In brace games, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
the cards are pulled out two at a time to change the run of them,
the case-keeper is always a confederate of the dealer, and is signalled
what cards have been pulled out under the cards shown, so
that he can secretly mark them up. A bet placed or left upon a
card of which none are left in the box is called a <i><b>sleeper</b></i>, and is
public property; the first man that can get his hands on it keeps it.</p>

<p>When only one card of any denomination is in the box, it is
obvious that such a card cannot be split, and that the bank has no
advantage of the player. Such cards are called <i><b>cases</b></i>, and the
betting limit on cases is only half the amount allowed on other
cards. It is not considered <i>comme il faut</i> for a player to wait for
cases, and those who play regularly usually make a number of
small bets during the early part of the deal, and then bet high on
the cases as they come along. A player who goes upon the principle
that the dealer can cheat those who bet high, and who follows
and goes against the big bets with small ones, or who plays one-chip
bets all over the board, hoping to strike a good spot to fish
on, is called a piker; and when a game runs small this way, the
dealers call it a <i><b>piking game</b></i>.</p>

<p><i><b>Keeping Tab.</b></i> In addition to the case-keeper, score sheets
are provided on which the players may keep a record of what
cards win and lose on each turn. These tabs are printed in vertical
columns, about five deals to a sheet. A dot indicates the
soda card; a dash, hoc. All winners are marked with a down
stroke, and all losers with a cypher. The diagram in the margin
will give a very good idea of a faro tab for a complete
deal. The Queen was soda, the Five split
out, and the Eight was in hoc.</p>

<p><i><b>Systems.</b></i> On the manner in which the cards
will go, a great many systems of play are based.
There are sixteen different ways for a card to
“play,” which are simply the permutations of the
stroke and the cypher arranged in rows of four at
a time. If a player is betting <i><b>three on a side</b></i>,
he will take each card as it becomes a case, and
bet that it either wins three times and loses once,
or loses once and wins three times. In the foregoing
deal he would have bet on the A 3 4 6 9 J
to lose on the fourth card out of the box, and
would have bet on the case cards of the 2 7 8 10
Q K to win. The Soda, it must be remembered, is really a winning
card. Of these bets he would have won 5 out of twelve,
taking back his money on the 8, as that card was left in hoc.
Playing <i><b>break even</b></i>, these bets would have been exactly reversed,
as all the cards would have played either to win and lose an equal
number of times, or to <i><b>win</b></i> or <i><b>lose out</b></i>; that is, to do the same
thing all four times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span></p>

<p>Another favourite system is colours. The player takes some
definite card, such as the soda, or the first winner or loser, as his
starter, and whatever the colour of the third card of each denomination,
that is, the card that makes it a case, he plays it to win or
lose, according to the system of colours he is playing. Many
players reverse on the last turn.</p>

<p>When a player bets one card to lose and another to win, and
loses both bets on the same turn, he is <i><b>whipsawed</b></i>.</p>

<p><i><b>The Last Turn.</b></i> If three different cards are left in for the
last turn, the players can <i><b>call the turn</b></i>, naming the order in which
they think the cards will be found. Suppose the three cards left
in the box are the 9 8 2, these may come in six different ways:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Cards">
  <tr>
    <td class="indented">9 8 2</td>
    <td class="indented">9 2 8</td>
    <td class="indented">8 9 2</td>
    <td class="indented">8 2 9</td>
    <td class="indented">2 9 8</td>
    <td class="indented">2 8 9</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The odds against any one of these ways are 5 to 1; but the
dealer pays 4 for 1 only. In calling the turn, the bet is strung from
the selected loser to the selected winner. If the third card intervenes,
the bet is strung away from it, to show that it goes round
the layout to the other card.</p>

<p>If there are two cards of the same denomination in the last turn,
it is called a <i><b>cat-hop</b></i>; and as it can come only three ways, the
dealer pays 2 for 1. Suppose the cards are 8 8 5, they can
come:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Cards">
  <tr>
    <td class="indented">8 8 5</td>
    <td class="indented">8 5 8</td>
    <td class="indented">5 8 8</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If three cards of the same denomination are left, the call is by
the colour, and is paid 2 for 1. Suppose two black and one red
card are left. These may come:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Cards">
  <tr>
    <td class="indented">B B R</td>
    <td class="indented">B R B</td>
    <td class="indented">R B B</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The bets are placed on the dealer’s right for red first; on his
left for black and red, and in front of him for two blacks.</p>

<p><i><b>CHEATING.</b></i> If Faro were honestly played, it would be one
of the prettiest banking games in the world; but unfortunately the
money to be made at this game is so great that the richest prizes
in the gambling world are offered to the men who can so handle
the cards as to “protect the money of the house.” All systems are
not only worthless, but dangerous to use, when opposed to the skill
of the modern faro dealer. A first-class “mechanic” can get
from one to two hundred dollars a week, and a percentage of the
profits; but it is hardly necessary to say that he is not paid that
amount simply for pulling cards out of a box. Before venturing to
“buck the tiger” get some one to show you how fifty-three cards
are shuffled up, so as to make the last turn come the way that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
there is most money in it for the house. Watch the movements
carefully, so that you will know them the next time you see them
in a fashionable house, which you imagine to be “dead square.”
If you see a dealer with a shuffling board as thick as his dealing
box, don’t play against that game. If you see a dealer take up
the cards already taken from the box, slipping them one under
the other, as if to straighten them up, the sooner you cash your
chips the better, for you are up against a brace game, no matter
where it is dealt.</p>

<p>The proprietors of some fashionable “clubs,” especially at watering
places, pretend to be above all such things as cheating at faro,
and get indignant at the suggestion of the possibility of there being
anything crooked in their establishments. The author has but
one reply to all such. If it is true that there is nothing unfair in
your game, let me put a type-writer girl in the dealer’s place to
shuffle and pull out the cards, and let your men just see to paying
and taking bets.</p>

<p>The boast of all these fashionable gambling houses is that they
never won a man’s money except in a square game. Strange to
say, this is generally true, and the explanation is very simple. If
you are losing there is no necessity to cheat you, so you lose your
money in a square game. If you are winning, it is the bank’s
money, and not yours, that they would win if they started to cheat
you; and as the dealer is paid to “protect the money of the house,”
as they call it, he is perfectly justified in throwing the harpoon
into you for a few deals, just to get his own money back; but he
is very careful not to cheat you out of any of your own money.
You may lose if you like, but you cannot win; faro banks are not
run that way.</p>

<h3>ROUGE ET NOIR, OR TRENTE-ET-QUARANTE.</h3>

<p>The banker and his assistant, called the croupier, sit opposite
each other at the sides of a long table, on each end of which are
two large diamonds, one red and the other black, separated by a
square space and a triangle. Any number of persons can play
against the bank, placing their bets on the colour they select, red
or black.</p>

<p>Six packs of fifty-two cards each are shuffled together and used
as one, the dealer taking a convenient number in his hand for each
deal. The players having made their bets, and cut the cards, the
dealer turns one card face upward on the table in front of him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
at the same time announcing the colour he deals for, which is always
for <i><b>black first</b></i>. The dealer continues to turn up cards one
by one, announcing their total pip value each time, until he reaches
or passes 31. Court cards and Tens count 10 each, the ace and all
others for their face value. Having reached or passed 31 for
black, the <i><b>red</b></i> is dealt for in the same manner, and whichever
colour most closely approaches 31, wins. Suppose 35 was dealt
for black, and 38 for red; black would win. The number dealt
must never exceed 40.</p>

<p>The colour of the first card dealt in each coup is noted, and if
the same colour wins the coup, the banker pays all bets placed on
the space marked <i><b>Couleur</b></i>. If the opposite colour wins, he pays
all bets in the triangle marked <i><b>Inverse</b></i>. All bets are paid in
even money, there being no odds at this game.</p>

<p>Although black is the first colour dealt for, both it and inverse
are ignored in the announcement of the result, red and colour
being the only ones mentioned, win or lose.</p>

<p>If the same number is reached for both colours, it is called a
<i><b>refait</b></i>, and is announced by the word, “Après,” which means
that all bets are a stand-off for that coup. If the refait happens
to be exactly 31, however, the bank wins half the money on the
table, no matter how it is placed. The players may either pay
this half at once, or may move their entire stake into the first
prison, a little square marked out on the table, and belonging to
the colour they bet upon. If they win the next coup, their stake is
free; if not, they lose it all. Should a second refait of 31 occur,
they would have to lose a fourth of this imprisoned stake, and the
remainder would be moved into a second prison, to await the
result of the next coup, which would either free it or lose it all.</p>

<p><i><b>Probabilities.</b></i> It has been found that of the ten numbers
that can be dealt, 31 to 40, the number 31 will come oftener than
any other. The proportions are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Probabilities of the numbers coming up">

</table>

<p>The 31 refait also comes oftener than any other. Although
the odds against it are supposed to be 63 to 1, the bankers expect it
about twice in three deals, and each deal will produce from 28 to
33 coups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span></p>

<h3>ROULETTE.</h3>

<p>It is probable that more money has been lost at the wheel than
at any other gambling game in the world. In conjunction with
Rouge et Noir, it forms the chief attraction at Monte Carlo, and
other public gambling casinos. The rage for these games was so
great, and the trickery connected with them so common, that they
were banished from France by the law of 18 juillet, 1836, and had
to take refuge in Baden and Homburg. Before that time the
public revenue from the gaming houses amounted to five or six
millions a year, all of which was lost by closing them up. The
evil was not exterminated, however, for there are to-day hundreds
of gambling hells in Europe, which make up for the brevity of
their existence by the rapidity with which they fleece their patrons.</p>

<p>In America, the wheel has always been popular, but Rouge et
Noir is practically unknown, the reason being that in the latter
game there is no variety, and therefore no chance for the player to
exercise any judgment, or to play any “system” in making his
bets, as he can in Faro.</p>

<p><i><b>The Wheel.</b></i> The roulette wheel is turned by a small cross-bar
rising from its axis. The surface of the wheel slopes from the
axis to the outer edge, which is divided into small square pockets,
coloured alternately red and black, and each having a number just
above it, on the surface of the wheel. These numbers may be in
any order, according to the fancy of the maker of the wheel, and
they may run from 1 to 27, to 30, to 33, or to 36. In addition to
the numbers there are zero marks, which are called <i><b>single</b></i> and
<i><b>double 0</b></i>, and <i><b>Eagle Bird</b></i>. All three of these are used in
American wheels, and they are green, so that they win for neither
colour. In some of the European wheels there are two zeros, the
single 0 being red, and the double 0 black. The single 0 also
counts as “odd,” and as below 19; while the double 0 is “even,”
and above 18. Bets on odd or even, above and below, are not
paid, however, but must remain on the table until the next roll,
when the player either gets back twice his money or loses it all.
At Monte Carlo there is only one zero, which is green, and takes
everything but bets on itself. The numbers on the wheel are arranged
as follows at Monte Carlo, the heavy type being the
black:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p536.jpg" width="500" height="45" alt="Arrangement of the numbers on the Roulette wheel" />
</div>

<p>The pockets on the edge of the wheel are at the bottom of a
sort of circular valley, the centre of which is formed by the revolving
wheel, and the outer slope by a stationary but rising margin or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
border, at the top of which is an overhanging edge, under which
the banker spins a small ivory ball, always in the direction opposite
to that in which the wheel is turning. As the ball loses its
momentum it strikes some little brass ridges, which cause it to
jump onto the wheel, and then to run into one of the pockets.
The number, the colour, odd or even, and whether above or below,
is immediately announced by the banker, and all bets are taken
and paid accordingly.</p>

<p><i><b>The Layout.</b></i> The wheel is sunk in the middle of a long
table, on each end of which is a layout, and on these layouts all
bets are placed. The divisions are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The heavy faced type indicates the black numbers:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p537.jpg" width="500" height="550" alt="Roulette layout" />
</div>

<p>Bets may be made on the following chances:</p>

<p>1. <i><b>En plein.</b></i> Flat upon any number, which pays 35 for 1.
The betting limit at Monte Carlo is 180 francs.</p>

<p>2. <i><b>A cheval</b></i>, on the line between two numbers, which pays
17 for 1. Betting limit on this chance is 360 francs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i><b>Un carré</b></i>, on a cross line, taking in four numbers. This
pays 8 for 1. Limit is 750 francs.</p>

<p>4. <i><b>Transversale</b></i>, at the end of any three numbers, and taking
them in horizontally. Pays 11 for 1. Limit is 560 francs.</p>

<p>5. <i><b>Transversale Six</b></i>, placed on the line at the end, taking
in the three numbers horizontally above and below. This pays 5
for 1. Limit is 1,200 francs.</p>

<p>6. <i><b>Bas.</b></i> At the bottom of any of the three vertical columns,
taking in the twelve numbers. This pays 2 for 1. Limit is
3,000 francs.</p>

<p>7. <i><b>Bas à cheval</b></i>, between any two of these columns. This
pays ½ for 1. Limit is 3,000 francs.</p>

<p>8. <i><b>Premier, Milieu, Dernier.</b></i> Bets placed in the spaces
marked P 12, M 12, and D 12, are upon the first, middle and last
twelve numbers; that is, from 1 to 12, 13 to 24, and 25 to 36 respectively.
This pays 2 for 1. Limit is 3,000 francs.</p>

<p>A cheval between any two of the last mentioned, pays ½ for 1.</p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing, all the following chances may be
bet upon. They all pay even money. The limit is 6,000 francs.</p>

<p>9. <i><b>Impair.</b></i> That the number will be odd.</p>

<p>10. <i><b>Pair.</b></i> That the number will be even.</p>

<p>11. <i><b>Manque.</b></i> That the number will be from 1 to 18.</p>

<p>12. <i><b>Passe.</b></i> That the number will be from 19 to 36.</p>

<p>13. <i><b>Rouge</b></i> or <i><b>Noir</b></i>. Red or Black.</p>

<p>The foregoing are the payments at Monte Carlo; but wheels
with less numbers are scaled down accordingly. The players can
bet on the zero if they choose, and they will be paid if it comes
up, 35 for 1, but all other bets are lost. In wheels with two
zeros, red and black, the bank wins on the colour which does
not come, and the bets on the right colour are neither paid nor
taken, but must remain until the next turn of the wheel. This
is now the practice at Monte Carlo, with the single-zero wheels.</p>

<p><i><b>Systems.</b></i> As at Faro, gamblers at Roulette are never tired of
devising systems to beat the game; but none of them are of any
further use than to afford a little passing amusement to their inventors.
Persons who are interested in systems will find in the
New York Sun, July 5, 1896, a very interesting tabulation of every
roll of the ball at Monte Carlo for seven successive days, 4,012 in
all, of which 120 were zeros. If they can find a system that will
beat the wheel for seven days, and have a return ticket, Monte
Carlo will take care of all their spare cash.</p>

<p>One curious fallacy about some systems is to imagine that they
will win if the player will quit when he is a certain amount ahead,
and not play again until next day. Until some rule can be given
by which the exact hour can be fixed to begin play, all such systems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
must be delusions, as there is no reason why a second man
should not begin where the first left off, and therefore no reason
why the first should not continue playing all the time.</p>

<p>It is in the interest of the proprietors of all gambling houses to
pretend to be afraid of systems. The word is passed round, and
the deluded gamesters think they have found the thread which has
held the sword of Damocles above the banker’s head so long.
As a matter of fact, there is no one so welcome at a gambling
house as a player with a system. A man may be fortunate enough
for a long time to guess right oftener than he will guess wrong,
and a lucky man in good guessing form is a very dangerous customer,
that no cold deck will beat; but a man with a system surrenders
to a double foe; the inevitable percentage of the game,
and the skill of the banker, who can beat any system if the player
will only promise to stick to it.</p>

<h3>KENO, OR LOTTO.</h3>

<p>This game is played with a large number of cards, on which are
printed various permutations of the numbers 1 to 90, taken five at
a time; but each of the five numbers selected for one combination
must be in a separate division of tens, such combinations as 2
4 8 16 18 not being allowed on any card, because the 2 4 and 8,
for instance, are all in the first ten numbers of the 90. These
cards have each a number, printed in large red type across the face
of the other figures. The following might be a keno card, No.
325:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p539.jpg" width="400" height="75" alt="A keno card" />
</div>

<p>Some cards have more than three rows of figures on them, but
none have more than five in one row.</p>

<p>The cards are left on the tables in large numbers, and any number
of persons may play. Each selects as many cards as he
wishes, or thinks he can watch, and places upon them their price,
usually twenty-five cents each. An assistant comes round and
calls out the numbers of all the cards to be played, and they are
“pegged” on a large board provided for the purpose.</p>

<p>Ninety small ivory balls, with flattened surfaces to carry the
numbers, are placed in a keno goose, which looks like a coffee urn
with the spout at the bottom. This spout can be screwed out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
put in the balls, and is controlled with a spring cut-off like a
powder horn, which lets out only one ball at a time. When all
the cards have been pegged, the goose is rapidly revolved several
times back and forth, and then a number is taken out, and placed
in a little tray with ninety depressions in it, numbered in regular
order, which hold the balls as they come from the goose. The
keno roller calls each number distinctly, and the players who find
it on their cards cover it with a button. The first player to get a
horizontal row of five numbers covered in this manner, calls out
“Keno!” or bangs the table with a card, and that stops the game.
An assistant comes round to the table and calls out the number of
the card; if it has been paid for and pegged, he proceeds to call
the numbers forming the keno, and these are checked by the roller
from the balls on the tray. If everything is correct, the player is
given all the money paid by the other players for their cards, less
the ten per cent which goes to the house. If two kenos are made
on the same number, they divide the pool equally.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the profitable nature of the game for the
house, it may be remarked that if ten men were to play keno for a
dollar a card, and each of them made keno ten times, they would
all be “dead broke;” because on each of the hundred kenos at
ten dollars each, the bank would have taken out its dollar percentage.</p>

<h3>CHUCK-LUCK.</h3>

<p>This game is sometimes called <i><b>Sweat</b></i>, and again, but erroneously,
<i><b>Hazard</b></i>. It is played with three dice, which are usually
thrown down a funnel in which several cross-bars are placed. The
player is offered five different forms of betting, all of which appear
on the <i><b>Layout</b></i>, and which cover all the combinations possible
with three dice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/p540.jpg" width="600" height="160" alt="A chuck-luck layout" />
</div>

<p>The Raffles are sometimes indicated by a representation of one
face of a die. Bets on single numbers pay even money, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
number bet on comes up on the face of any of the three dice. If
it comes up on two of them, such as two deuces, it pays double;
but if all three dice are alike it is a <i><b>raffle</b></i>, and the house takes all
bets not placed on raffles. Bets on the numbers from 18 to 3 are
upon the total count of the pips on the upper faces of the three
dice. The small figures under these numbers show the odds paid;
14, for instance, pays twelve for one. All raffles pay 180 for one;
the same as 18 or 3.</p>

<p>Bets on High and Low, Odd or Even, pay even money. High
throws are all above 10, and low throws are all below 11. This
would be perfectly even betting if the house did not take raffles.
Some houses allow a player to bet on raffles generally; that is,
to bet that a raffle of some kind will come. Such bets are paid 30
for 1.</p>

<p>The percentage of the house, even in a square game, may be
seen from the following table, which gives the odds against the
event, and the odds which the house pays:&mdash;</p>

<p><i><b>Cheating.</b></i> There are endless ways of swindling at Chuck-luck,
the most modern being to turn the dice over after they have
reached the table through the funnel. This is done by an apparatus
under the cloth, the dealer looking down the funnel to see how
the dice lie, and then adjusting them to suit himself. Another
method is to hold out one die, throwing only two down the funnel,
and slipping the third down the outside, turning it so that when it
is combined with the two already in the funnel it will beat the big
bets on the layout. Raffles can be forced in this way whenever the
two dice in the funnel are paired.</p>

<h3>RONDEAU.</h3>

<p>This game is played on a pocket billiard table. The banker asks
for bets on the <i><b>inside</b></i> and <i><b>outside</b></i>, and the amounts staked on
each side must balance. So long as they do not balance, the banker
must ask for what he wants: “Give me fourteen dollars on the
outside to make the game,” etc. As soon as the amounts balance,
and no more bets are offered, he says: “Roll. The game is
made.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span></p>

<p>A round stick, about a foot long, is placed behind nine small
ivory balls. Any person may roll. He takes his stand at one corner
of the table and rolls the balls across the table to the pocket
diagonally opposite him. At least one ball must go into the pocket
and one must be left out, or they must be rolled over again. The
number of balls left outside the pocket, odd or even, decides
whether the inside or the outside bets win; and after the banker
has deducted his ten per cent, the players who have backed the
winning side get their money.</p>

<h3>MONTE BANK.</h3>

<p>The money staked by the banker is piled upon the table, so that
all players may see what is to be won. The banker takes a Spanish
pack of forty cards, shuffles them, and offers them to the players
to be cut. Holding the pack face down, the banker draws two
cards from the bottom and places them on the table, face up, for
the “bottom layout.” He then draws two cards from the top of
the pack for the “top layout.”</p>

<p>The players can bet on either layout, and after all the bets are
placed the pack is turned face up. The card that shows is called
the “gate.” If it is of the same suit as either of the cards in the
top layout, the banker pays all bets on that layout. If there is a
card of the same suit as the gate in the bottom layout, the banker
pays that also. If there is no card of the same suit as the gate in
either of the layouts, the banker wins from that layout; so that he
may win or lose from either or both on the same gate.</p>

<p>The pack is then turned face down, the gate is drawn off and
thrown aside and two fresh layouts are made, as before and the
bets placed before the new gate is shown. This is continued until
the pack is exhausted.</p>

<h3>THREE-CARD MONTE.</h3>

<p>This is a purely gambling game, chiefly useful for separating
fools from their money. The dealer takes three cards, slightly bent
lengthwise, so as to be more easily picked up by the ends. One of
these is shown, and the players are told to watch it. After a few
skilful passes, the three cards come to rest on the layout, and the
players are asked to bet that they can pick out the card shown.</p>

<p>If the dealer will lay two to one, it is a fair gamble; but if he lays
even money only, the player is betting two to one against himself.
There are endless ways of pretending to mark the shown card, so
that it may be known by the back; but the dealer or his confederate
always knows that this is done, and the mark is shifted during
the passes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span></p>

<h3>UNDER AND OVER SEVEN.</h3>

<p>This game is played with a layout, divided and marked as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p543.jpg" width="300" height="125" alt="A layout for this game" />
</div>

<p>The players can bet on any of the three spaces. Two dice are
thrown by the banker, and if the number thrown is <i><b>under</b></i> seven
he pays all bets upon the U, even money, taking all those upon 7
and O. If the throw is <i><b>over</b></i> seven, he pays all bets upon the O,
taking all those upon U and 7. If seven is thrown, he pays all
bets upon that number, three for one, and takes all upon U and
O.</p>

<p>As there are 36 possible throws with two dice, 15 being under
and 15 over seven, the percentage in favour of the banker is always
21 to 15, on U and O. As there are only 6 ways out of 36 to throw
seven, the odds against it are 5 to 1; but the banker pays only 3
for 1. In spite of this enormous percentage in his favour, he frequently
adds to his revenue by skilful cheating.</p>

<h3>LANSQUENET.</h3>

<p>This is a banking game for any number of players, with a pack of
fifty-two cards. After the pack has been shuffled and cut, the dealer
lays off two cards, face up for “hand cards.” He then deals a card
for himself and one for the players, also face up. If either of these
is of the same denomination as either of the hand cards, it must be
placed with them, and another card dealt; because all bets must
be made on single cards.</p>

<p>Having two cards, one for the players and one for himself, the
banker turns up cards one at a time. If he draws the same denomination
as the players’ card, he wins all the bets upon it. If he
draws his own denomination, he loses all bets upon the other card.
If he draws a card that matches neither, and is not in the hand
cards, it is placed on the table, and the players can bet upon it.</p>

<p>As soon as the players’ card is matched, the banker withdraws
both cards, but he cannot withdraw his own card. All cards
matching the hand cards must be placed with them.</p>

<h2 id="TABLE_GAMES">TABLE GAMES.</h2>

<p>The common form of folding chess-board provides a field for
three of our best known games; Chess, Checkers, and Backgammon,
which are generally spoken of as “table games,” although,
strictly speaking, Backgammon is the only game of Tables. These
three games were probably played long before history noticed them,
and they have survived almost all ancient forms of amusement.</p>

<p><i><b>Chess</b></i> is not only the most important of the three, but the most
widely known, and possesses the most extensive literature. According
to Chatto, it is probable that all games of cards owe their
origin to chess, cards themselves having been derived from an old
Indian variation of chess, known as the Four Kings. Chess is also
the most fascinating of the table games, its charm being probably
due to the fact that, like whist, it is a game that no man ever mastered.
Whether or not this is in its favour is an open question.
The amount of study and practice required to make a person proficient
in chess brings a serious drain upon the time, and the fascinations
of the game are such that once a person has become
thoroughly interested in it, everything else is laid aside, and it is
notorious that no man distinguished as a chess-player has ever
been good for anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. Blackburne, the English chess champion, regards the game
as a dangerous intellectual vice which is spreading to rather an
alarming extent. Discussing the matter, after his game with Mr.
Bardeleben, he said: “I know a lot of people who hold the view
that chess is an excellent means of training the mind in logic and
shrewd calculation, provision and caution. But I don’t find these
qualities reflected in the lives of chess-players. They are just as
fallible and foolish as other folks who don’t know a rook from a
pawn. But even if it were a form of mental discipline, which I
doubt, I should still object to it on the ground of its fatal fascination.
Chess is a kind of mental alcohol. It inebriates the man
who plays it constantly. He lives in a chess atmosphere, and his
dreams are of gambits and the end of games. I have known many
an able man ruined by chess. The game has charmed him, and,
as a consequence, he has given up everything to the charmer.
No, unless a man has supreme self-control, it is better that he
should not learn to play chess. I have never allowed my children
to learn it, for I have seen too much of its evil results. Draughts
is a better game, if you must have a game.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span></p>

<p>Chess is generally believed to have originated in India, and in its
primitive form was called Chaturanga. It is mentioned in the Hindoo
Puranas, at least 3000 years B. C. The game seems to have
spread eastward long before it came West, going through Burmah
to Thibet, Siam, China, Malacca, Java, and Borneo. Owing
to the better preservation of historical records in China, many persons
have been led to credit that country with the invention of
chess, but recent investigations have shown that the Chinese got it
from India. At some remote period of the world’s history the
game was taken from China to Japan, and there are to-day many
points in common between the games played in these two countries,
especially in the arrangement of the pieces, although the
Japanese board has eighty-one squares.</p>

<p>Chess came westward through Constantinople, it having passed
through Persia sometime during the sixth century. The Arabs
seem to have learned the game, and taken it to Mecca and
Medina, afterward passing it along to Syria and the Byzantines,
sometime during the seventh century. Disbanded body-guards of
the Byzantine emperors carried it to Scandinavia and the North,
while it was gradually spreading over Europe by way of the Bosphoros
and the Danube.</p>

<p><i><b>Draughts</b></i>, or <i><b>Checkers</b></i>, is sometimes claimed to be an older
game than Chess: but it is much more probable that both are
developments of some still older game, all trace of which is lost.
In Egypt and Nubia there are illustrations of persons playing at
draughts twenty centuries before the Christian era. During recent
explorations in Egypt quite a variety of draughtmen have been
found, some of which were used during the reign of Rameses III.
The usual form seems to have been circular, about an inch in
diameter, and surmounted by a round knob, something like a chess
pawn, so that the men could be easily picked up. From the manner
in which the men are shown mixed upon the board, it is evident
that they could not move or take backwards, as in Polish
draughts, but whether they advanced diagonally, as at the present
day, there is no evidence to show. The Japanese game of draughts
has lately been revived in England and America under the name
of Go-Bang, but as it requires a special board of 324 squares, it
has never been popular.</p>

<p><i><b>Backgammon</b></i> cannot be traced to its origin. Several authorities
have fallen into the error of ascribing the game to a certain
country because the name is derived from a certain language,
forgetting that in ancient times every country invented its own
names for games. Chess is called Choke-choo-hong-ki in China,
and Shogi in Japan; but that does not make it either a Chinese or
a Japanese game. Either of these names might be used for Backgammon,
as they have exactly the same meaning. The Welsh
words, bach, and cammen; or the Saxon bac, and gamen, signify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
“a little battle;” while the Chinese and Japanese names for Chess
signify “mimic warfare.”</p>

<p>The Welsh and Saxons undoubtedly got Backgammon from the
Romans, who played it under the name of Scripta Duodecimo.
They seemed to have got it from the Greeks, who are known to
have used a table called Abacus, very much like a backgammon
board in form, with lines drawn upon it, and the men were moved
from one line to another according to the throws of the dice.</p>

<p>There is no trace of Backgammon among the games of the
Egyptians or the Hebrews, although the chief factors in the game,
the dice, have been known to all nations, and are probably the oldest
gaming instruments in the world.</p>

<p>As to the respective merits of these table games, there is little to
be said. Curiously enough they are played by entirely different
classes of people. Backgammon has always been highly respectable,
and seems likely to retain its position as the fashionable game.
Draughts is peculiarly the game of the middle classes, popular at
the workman’s dinner hour, in the sitting-rooms of cheap hotels,
in country clubs, and in fire engine stations; the latter being a favourite
training ground for our checker champions. Chess is probably
the most universal game of all, and its general character is
understood by almost every educated person in the world.</p>

<h3>CHESS.</h3>

<p>Chess is played upon a square board, divided into sixty-four
smaller squares of equal size. These small squares are usually of
different colours, alternately light and dark, and the board must be
so placed that each player shall have a light square at his right, on
the side nearer him.</p>

<p>Each player is provided with sixteen men, eight of which are
called <i><b>pieces</b></i>, and eight <i><b>pawns</b></i>. The men on one side are red
or black, and those on the other side are white or yellow, and they
are usually of a standard pattern, which is known as the Staunton
model.</p>

<p>The eight pieces are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The King, ♚</li>
<li>The Queen, ♛</li>
<li>Two Rooks or Castles, ♜</li>
<li>Two Bishops, ♝</li>
<li>and two Knights, ♞</li>
</ul>

<p>These eight pieces are arranged on the side of the board nearer
the player, and immediately in front of them stand the eight
Pawns, ♟. Diagram No. 1 will show the proper arrangement
of the men at the beginning of a game:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<p class="caption"><i>No. 1.</i></p>
<p class="caption">BLACK.</p>
<img src="images/p547.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Chessboard showing the layout described" />
<p class="caption">WHITE.</p>
</div>

<p>It will be observed that the two Queens are opposite each other,
and that each Queen stands upon a square of the same colour as
herself. For irregularities in setting up the men, see the Laws of
Chess.</p>

<p>The <i><b>players</b></i> are designated by the colour of the men with
which they play, Black or White, and White always has the first
move. In a series of games each player alternately takes the
white men with the first move. It is usual to draw for the first
game, one player concealing in each hand a pawn of a different
colour, and offering the choice of hands to his adversary. Whichever
colour the chosen hand contains is the one the chooser must
take for the first game.</p>

<p>The duplicate pieces of each colour are distinguished by their
position with regard to the King or Queen; those on the King’s
side being called the King’s Bishop, the King’s Knight, and the
King’s Rook. Those on the Queen’s side are the Queen’s Bishop,
Queen’s Knight, and Queen’s Rook. The pawns are designated
by the pieces in front of which they stand; King’s Pawn; Queen’s
Knight’s Pawn, etc.</p>

<p>The comparative <i><b>value of the pieces</b></i> changes a little in the
course of play, the Rooks especially not being so valuable early in
the game. Authorities differ a little as to the exact value of the
pieces, but if we take the Pawn as a unit, the fighting value of the
others will be about as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span></p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p><i><b>THE MOVES.</b></i> Each piece has a movement peculiar to itself,
and, with the exception of the Pawns, any piece can capture
and remove from the board any opposing piece which it finds in
its line of movement. The captured piece is not jumped over,
but the capturing piece simply occupies the square on which the
captured piece stood. The movement of each piece should be
studied separately.</p>

<p>♟ <i><b>The Pawns</b></i> move straight forward, one square at a time,
except on the first move, when they have the privilege of
moving either one or two squares, at the option of the player.
In capturing, the Pawn does not take the piece directly in its path,
but the one diagonally in front of it on either side. Such a capture
of course takes the Pawn from the file it originally occupied,
and it must then continue to advance in a straight line on its new
file. In Diagram No. 2, the white Pawns could not capture either
of the black Bishops or Rooks, but the Pawn on the left could take
either of the black Knights:&mdash;</p>

<p>After a Pawn has crossed the middle line of the board into the
adversary’s territory, it is called a <i><b>passed Pawn</b></i>. If an adverse
Pawn attempts to pass this Pawn by availing itself of the privilege
of moving two squares the first time, that would not prevent
the passed Pawn from capturing it <i><b>en passant</b></i>. In the position
shown in Diagram No. 3, for instance, if the black Queen’s Pawn
were to advance two squares, the white Pawn could capture it en
passant, lifting it from the board, and taking the position that the
black Pawn would have occupied if it had moved only one square
the first time; that is, the first black square in front of the Queen.
A Pawn can be taken en passant only by another pawn, never by
any other piece.</p>

</div>

<p>♜ <i><b>The Rook</b></i> can be moved any number of squares at a time,
forward or backward, but only in vertical or horizontal
lines, never diagonally. The Rook’s movement is of course
limited by pieces obstructing its path, for it cannot jump over
anything. At the beginning of the game, for instance, the Rook
cannot move at all.</p>

<p>♝ <i><b>The Bishop</b></i> can be moved any number of squares at a
time, forward or backward, but only in diagonal lines,
never horizontally or vertically. For this reason the Bishop
never leaves the squares of the same colour as that on which it
originally stood. A Bishop is often spoken of as a white Bishop
or a black Bishop, which does not mean that it is one of White’s
Bishops, or one of Black’s; but that it stands upon a white or
black square. Like the Rook, the Bishop cannot jump over other
pieces, and cannot be moved at all until one or other of the two
Pawns diagonally in front of it have opened the way.</p>

<p>♛ <i><b>The Queen</b></i> combines the movements of the Rook and
Bishop, and can be moved horizontally, vertically, or diagonally,
any number of squares at a time, provided that the
path is clear. Like the Rook and Bishop, she cannot move at all
until some of the adjoining pieces have made a way for her.</p>

<p>♚ <i><b>The King</b></i> has the same movement as the Queen, but is
limited to one square at a time. The King is not allowed
to move to a square which would expose him to capture by
adverse pieces, for reasons which will presently be explained.</p>

<p>♞ <i><b>The Knight</b></i> has a very peculiar movement, which is L
shaped, and necessitates his changing the colour of the
square he stands on, every time he moves. The simplest
way for the beginner to learn the Knight’s move is to observe that
he must go two squares, neither more nor less, in a vertical or a
horizontal direction, and must then change the colour of the
square he stands on by going one square either to the right or left,
which will complete the L shaped movement. Diagram No. 4
will show that when the Knight is away from the side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
board, he may go to any one of eight different squares; but when
he is in a corner he can go to two only. For that reason Knights
are much more powerful when placed near the centre of the board.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<p class="caption"><i>No. 4.</i></p>
<img src="images/p550a.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Chessboard showing the layout described" />
</div>

<p>The peculiarity of the Knight’s move is that it is not retarded
by other pieces, because the Knight can jump over them, a privilege
which is not given to any other piece on the board. In
Diagram No. 5, for instance, the Knights have been legitimately
moved, but no other piece could be moved until the Pawns had
made way for it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<p class="caption"><i>No. 5.</i></p>
<img src="images/p550b.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="Chessboard showing the layout described" />
</div>

<p>There are one or two peculiar movements which are allowed
only under certain conditions. One of these is <i><b>Castling</b></i>. If
there are no pieces between the King and the Rook, and neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
piece has been moved, the King may be moved two squares toward
the Rook, and at the same time the Rook may be brought round to
the other side of the King. The movement must be made with
both hands, each manipulating a piece. In the position shown in
Diagram No. 6, for instance, the King could castle on either side,
with the King’s Rook, or with the Queen’s Rook:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<p class="caption"><i>No. 6.</i></p>
<img src="images/p551a.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Chessboard showing the layout described" />
</div>

<p>If an adverse piece commands the square that would be passed
over by the King in castling, the move is not allowed; because a
King must not move into check, nor cross a square that is checked
by an adverse piece nor castle out of check.</p>

<p>In Diagram No. 7 the position that would result from castling
with the Queen’s Rook is shown by the black men.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Queening Pawns.</b></i> If a passed Pawn succeeds in reaching
the last or eighth square on any file, the player to whom the Pawn
belongs may call it anything he chooses, from a Queen to a
Knight. If the piece he chooses has already been captured, it
must be replaced on the board, and on the square occupied by the
Pawn, which is then removed. If not, some other piece must be
put upon the board as a marker; a Rook upside down, or a Pawn
with a ring on it, may represent a second Queen.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECT OF THE GAME.</b></i> If all the pieces could be
captured, the object of the game might be to clear the board of
the adversary’s men, as in Checkers; but the peculiarity of Chess
is that one piece, the King, cannot be captured, and the object is
to get the adverse King in such a position that he could not
escape capture if he were a capturable piece. When that is accomplished
the King is said to be <i><b>mated</b></i>, and the player who
first succeeds in giving mate to the adversary’s King wins the
game, regardless of the number or value of the pieces either side
may have on the board at the time the mate is accomplished.</p>

<p>When an adverse piece is moved so that it could capture the
King on the next move, due notice must be given to the threatened
King by announcing “<i><b>Check</b></i>,” and the player must immediately
move his King out of check, interpose a piece or a Pawn, or capture
the piece that gives the check. If he cannot do one of these
three things he is mated, and loses the game. A very simple
example of a mate is given in Diagram No. 8.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<p class="caption"><i>No. 8.</i></p>
<img src="images/p552.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="Chessboard showing the layout described" />
</div>

<p>The white Rook has just been moved down to the edge of the
board, giving “check.” As the black King can move only one
square at a time, he cannot get out of check by moving, because
the only squares to which he could go would still leave him in
check from the Rook. Neither the Knight nor the Bishop can interpose
to shut out the Rook’s attack; neither of those pieces can
capture the Rook; and the Pawns cannot move backward; so the
black King is mated, and White wins the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span></p>

<p>A mate may take place in the middle of the board, as shown in
Diagram No. 9.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<p class="caption"><i>No. 9.</i></p>
<img src="images/p553a.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="Chessboard showing the layout described" />
</div>

<p>If the black Queen moves diagonally four squares, placing herself
in front of the white King, and on the same horizontal file as
the black Rook, it will be check-mate, because the white King
cannot get out of one check into another by taking the Queen,
which is protected by the Rook. For the same reason he cannot
move, as the only squares open to him would leave him in check
from the Queen, or move him into check from the black King.</p>

<p><i><b>Stalemate.</b></i> If the King is not in check, but cannot move
without going into check, and there is no other piece for the player
to move, it is called a stale-mate, and the game is drawn. In Diagram
No. 10, for instance,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<p class="caption"><i>No. 10.</i></p>
<img src="images/p553b.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Chessboard showing the layout described" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">the black King cannot move without going into check from the
Pawn or the King; none of the black Pawns can move, and Black
cannot move the Rook without putting his own King in check,
(from the Bishop,) which is not allowed.</p>

<p><i><b>Perpetual Check.</b></i> If a piece gives check to the adverse
King, and the King moves away, the check may be repeated, and
the King must move again, or interpose a piece, or capture the
checking piece. If the position is such that no matter how often
the King moves or is covered he cannot get out of check, and no
matter how much the opposing pieces move they cannot check-mate
him, the game is drawn by perpetual check. Diagram No.
11 is an illustration of such a position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<p class="caption"><i>No. 11.</i></p>
<p class="caption">BLACK.</p>
<img src="images/p554.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="Chessboard showing the layout described" />
</div>

<p>The only way out of the check is to interpose the Queen, whereupon
the white Queen will move diagonally to the edge of the
board and check again, forcing the black Queen back where she
came from, and drawing the game by perpetual check. If the
black Queen moves away from the King, she will be captured,
and White will give check-mate at the same time.</p>

<p><i><b>NOTATION.</b></i> The various moves which take place in the
course of a game are recorded by a system of chess notation, the
number of the move being given first, and then the pieces moved
and the direction of their movement. The names of the pieces
themselves are used to distinguish the various files of squares running
vertically from the piece itself to the opposite side of the
board, and the seven squares in front of each piece are numbered
from 2 to 8. No matter how much the pieces may be moved, the
various vertical files still retain the name of the pieces which stood
at the bottom of them when the men were first set up. In chess
notation, only the initials of the pieces are used, K standing for
King, and Kt for Knight. Although the files bear the same
names, the numbers count from the side on which the men are
placed, so that each square has a double name, depending on the
colour of the man placed upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<p class="caption"><i>No. 12.</i></p>
<img src="images/p555.jpg" width="400" height="360" alt="Chessboard showing the layout described, and introducing notation" />
</div>

<p>In Diagram No. 12, for instance, both the Pawns that have
been moved would be spoken of as on K 4. The Knight that
has been moved is on K B 3, because it is a white Knight.
If it was a black Knight it would be on K B 6, reckoning from
the black side of the board for the black pieces. In order to test
your understanding of this system of notation, which is very important
in following published games or problems, take the board
and men, white side next you, and set up the following position,
remembering that when no number is given, the piece stands upon
the square originally occupied by the piece which gives its name to
the file:&mdash;</p>

<p>Black men;&mdash;King on Q R’s; Queen on Q Kt’s; Pawns on Q
R 2, and Q Kt, 3; Rook on Q R 3.</p>

<p>White men;&mdash;King on Q Kt 5; Queen on Q B 6.</p>

<p>Now look at Diagram No 11, and see if you have it right.</p>

<p>In addition to the notation of position, there is that of action.
If a dash is placed between the initials of the piece and the definition
of the square, it shows first the piece moved, and then the
square to which it is moved. In Diagram No 11, for instance,
Black’s only move to cover the check would be given: Q-Q Kt 2;
and White’s continuation would be given; Q-K 8.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span></p>

<p>The first of these might be abbreviated by saying, Q-Kt 2, because
there is only one Kt 2 to which the Queen could be moved.</p>

<p>The moves of the white pieces are always given first, either in
the left hand of two vertical columns, which are headed “White,”
and “Black” respectively; or above a line which divides the
white move from the black, the latter form being used in text-books,
the former in newspapers. The moves in Diagram No. 11
would be as follows, supposing the white Queen to arrive from K8
in the first place:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="A columnar layout of chess moves">
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th><i>White.</i></th>
    <th><i>Black.</i></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1.</td>
    <td>Q-B 6, ch</td>
    <td>Q-Kt 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2.</td>
    <td>Q-K 8, ch</td>
    <td>Q-Kt’s</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Or this;</p>

<div class="chess">
  <div class="move">
    <div class="number">1.</div>
    <div class="top">Q-B 6, ch</div>
    <div class="bottom">Q-Kt 2</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When the abbreviation “ch.” is placed after a move, it means
“check.” If it is a mate, or a drawn game, or the player resigns,
the word follows the move. When the King castles with the
King’s Rook, which is the shorter move for the Rook, it is indicated
by the sign O-O. When the King is castled with the
Queen’s Rook, which is the longer move for the Rook, the sign
O-O-O is used.</p>

<p>A cross, x, placed after the piece moved shows that it captured
something, and the letters following the cross do not give the
square to which the piece is moved, but show the piece that is captured.
K B x Q P, for instance, would mean that the adversary’s
Queen’s Pawn was to be taken from the board, and the King’s
Bishop was to occupy the square upon which the captured Queen’s
Pawn had stood.</p>

<p>Beginners usually have some difficulty in following the moves
of the Knights, because it frequently happens that the same square
can be reached by either of them. The Bishops cannot be confused
in this way, because they never change the colour of the
square they stand upon. In some sets of chessmen the Knights
are distinguished by putting a small crown on the King’s Knight,
but this is never done in the regulation Staunton model. The
beginner will find it very convenient, when following out the play
of published games, to screw off the bottom of one white and one
black Knight, and to exchange the bases. The white King’s
Knight will then have a black base, and the black King’s Knight
will have a white base, and they can be easily identified at any
period of the game.</p>

<p><i><b>GERMAN NOTATION.</b></i> Many of our standard chess
books, and some of the best edited chess columns, are in German,
and the student should be familiar with the German notation,
which is much simpler than the English.</p>

<p>The white men are always considered as the side nearer the
player; the vertical columns are designated from left to right by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
the letters a b c d e f g h; and the horizontal rows by the numbers
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, beginning at the bottom, or white side. The pieces
are designated by one capital letter only, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>K for König, or King.</li>
<li>D for Dame, or Queen.</li>
<li>T for Thurm, or Rook.</li>
<li>L for Läufer, or Bishop.</li>
<li>S for Springer, or Knight.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Pawn is called a Bauer, but when it is moved no initial is
given, simply the square it comes from. In Diagram No. 12, for
instance, the English notation for the first two moves made by
white would be:&mdash;P-K 4, and K Kt-B 3, or, Kt-K B 3. The
German notation would be:&mdash;e 2-e 4; and S g 1-f 3. The move
of the Knight, it will be observed, gives the initial of the piece and
the square upon which it stands, and then the square to which it is
moved. A capture is indicated by the letter “n” taking the place
of the dash. If the white Knight took the black King’s Pawn in
Diagram No. 12, for instance, the move would be recorded: S f 3
n e 5, that is, the Springer at f 3 “nimmt” whatever it found at
e 5. A check is indicated by a plus sign, +, following the move.
In Diagram No. 11, for instance, the last move of the white Queen
would be: D e 8-c 6 +; and Black’s reply would be: D b 8-b 7.</p>

<p><i><b>THE OPENINGS.</b></i> Time and experience have shown that
it is best for each player to adopt certain conventional openings,
in order to develop his pieces. White always has the advantage,
usually believed to be equal to 55%, counting drawn games as one
half. This is because White can usually take more risks in offering
a gambit than Black can in accepting it, and the best judges
say that they would rather give a Knight and take the white pieces,
than give Pawn-and-move and take the black. <i><b>Gambit</b></i> is a
term used in Italian wrestling, and means that the adversary is
given an apparent advantage at the start, in order more successfully
to trip him up later on.</p>

<p>There are a great many chess openings, all of which have been
analysed as far as the tenth move, including every possible variation
on the way. The student who wishes to study them in detail
should procure Freeborough’s “Chess Openings,” or Cook’s
“Synopsis.” In these works, if either side has an advantage before
the tenth move, it is indicated by a plus sign; if the position
is equal, it is so marked.</p>

<p>In studying openings, the student should be careful always to
play with the winning side next him; that is, never study how to
play a losing game. If the variation ends with a plus sign, showing
a win for the white, play it over with the white men next you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
In selecting openings for general use in play, if it is one for the
white men, take those openings that have the greatest number of
variations ending in favour of white. The Ruy Lopez is a very
good opening for beginners, and the Evans’ Gambit may be studied
later. The French Defence and the Petroff are good openings
for Black.</p>

<p>The theory of opening is to mobilise your forces for the attack
in the fewest possible moves. Lasker thinks six moves should be
enough for this purpose, and he recommends that only the King’s
and Queen’s Pawns should be moved, after which each piece
should be placed at once upon the square from which it can operate
to the best advantage. He thinks the Knights should be first
brought out, and posted at B 3, and then the K’s B, somewhere
along his own diagonal. The great mistake made by beginners is
that they rush off to the attack and try to capture some of the
adverse pieces before they have properly prepared themselves for
re-inforcement or retreat. It should never be forgotten that the
game is not won by capturing the adversary’s pieces, but by
check-mating his King.</p>

<p>Take the board and pieces, arrange them with the white men
next you, and play over the following simple little game. Remember
that the figures above the line are for the white men;
those below for the black.</p>

<div class="chess">

    <div class="top">B-B4</div>
    <div class="bottom">B-Kt5</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The third move made by Black accomplishes nothing, and is
simply a waste of time. He should have continued by bringing
his Knights into play. His fourth move is also a mistake; he
should develop the Knights before the Bishops.</p>

<div class="chess">

    <div class="top">Kt-Q5 mate</div>
    <div class="bottom">&nbsp;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>On his fifth move, Black jumps at the chance to win White’s
Queen, but this is not of the slightest benefit to him, because the
object of the game is not to win the Queen, but to mate the King.
At the seventh move the beginner will see that the black King
cannot move out of check, neither can he move into check by taking
the Bishop. He has no piece that can capture the Knight that
gives the check, and nothing can be interposed, so he is mated,
and White wins.</p>

<p>Here is another simple little game. Take the black pieces this
time, but make the white men move first, of course.</p>

develop your pieces rapidly.</p>

    <div class="bottom">KtxP</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>White’s sixth move is bad, and you immediately take advantage
of it. If he takes your Knight with his Pawn, you will take his
K B P with your Bishop, and say “Check.” If he takes the Bishop
you win his Queen. If he moves his King you check again with
your other Bishop, which will force him to take your black Bishop,
and lose his Queen.</p>

<div class="chess">

  </div>
</div>

<p>If the beginner will examine the position, he will find that there
is no way of escape for the King, and Black wins.</p>

<p>Openings are usually divided into five principal classes: Those
in which the first piece developed is the <i><b>King’s Knight</b></i>; those
in which the <i><b>King’s Bishop</b></i> is the first piece brought into play;
those in which a <i><b>Gambit</b></i> is offered on the second move, usually
a sacrificed Pawn; those which are called <i><b>Close</b></i> openings, securing
a good defensive game for the black pieces; and those which
are <i><b>Irregular</b></i>.</p>

<p>In the following outline of fifty of the openings, only the first
four moves are given, and usually only one variation is selected,
the object being more to give the student an idea of the development
than to exhaust the subject. The arrangement is alphabetical,
that being more convenient in a book of reference. For the
continuations the student is recommended to study “Freeborough,”
or the “Handbuch des Schachspiels.”</p>

<p><i><b>GAMES AT ODDS.</b></i> Between unequal players it is a
common practice for the stronger to give the weaker some advantage.
Very few are able to give a Queen, or even a Rook, but a
<i><b>Knight</b></i> is quite common, and one who can concede a Knight to
the weakest players in a club is usually spoken of as, “a Knight
player.” The most common odds between nearly equal players is
<i><b>Pawn and Move</b></i>; and with a player not strong enough to give
a Knight, <i><b>Pawn and Two Moves</b></i>. The Pawn removed in
each instance is Black’s K B P, and the Knight is usually the Q Kt.
Here are a few examples of the openings in games at odds:&mdash;</p>

<p><i><b>THE MIDDLE GAME.</b></i> After a little experience with
openings, the player will usually select one or two which he feels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
that he can handle better than others, and will make a specialty of
them. Having mastered a number of variations, and learned the
object of them in forming his pieces for attack or defence, he will
naturally be led to the study of the middle game. In this there are
a few general principles which should be steadily kept in view.
For attack, the player should secure command of a wide range of
the board; but for defence he should concentrate his forces as
much as possible. He should be careful not to get his pieces in
one another’s way, and not to leave pieces where they can be
attacked and driven back by inferior pieces, because that entails a
loss of valuable time. A player should never exchange a man in
active service for one that is doing nothing. If several lines of
play are open, the one offering the most numerous good continuations
should be selected. When a player is not ready for attack,
he should develop his pieces, and remember that the more of them
he can get to bear on the enemy’s King, the better. Supporting
pieces should be placed where they are not easily attacked, because
good players attack the supports first, so as to isolate the advance
guard. Beginners are usually in too great a hurry to give
check; the best players do not check until they are ready to follow
it up with a mate, or a winning position, or can gain time in developing
their pieces.</p>

<p><i><b>END GAMES.</b></i> There are certain positions in which apparently
equal games are not necessarily drawn, and there are
others in which a player with a decided advantage cannot win,
within the fifty moves which are allowed him, unless he knows exactly
how to proceed. If a player is not well up in endings he
may lose many a game which could be won if he only knew how
to win it. The following games may be abandoned as <i><b>drawn</b></i>:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>King and Bishop against a King.</li>
<li>King and Knight against a King.</li>
<li>King and two Knights against a King.</li>
<li>King and Queen against two Rooks.</li>
<li>King and Queen against King and two Bishops.</li>
<li>King and Rook against King, Rook and Pawn.</li>
<li>King and Rook against King and Bishop.</li>
<li>King and Rook against King and Knight.</li>
<li>King and Rook against King, Rook and Bishop.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following games can be <i><b>won</b></i>:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>King and Queen, or King and Rook, against a King.</li>
<li>King and Queen against King and Rook.</li>
<li>King and Queen against King and Bishop.</li>
<li>King and Queen against King and Knight.</li>
<li>King and Queen against King and Pawn.</li>
<li>King and two Rooks against King and Rook.</li>
<li>King and two Bishops against a King.</li>
<li>King Bishop and Knight against a King.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to master all these endings, the student should take up
Staunton’s Handbook, or the Lehrbuch des Schachspiels, in which
they are given very fully. For the beginner only one or two of the
most common and important are necessary.</p>

<p>K and Q, or K and R, against K. All that is necessary is to
drive the King to the edge of the board, which may be done by
holding him below a certain parallel with the Q or R, and then
getting your own King in front of him; a check will then drive him
one line further back, and when he arrives at the edge of the board,
and can no longer go back, he is mated.</p>

<p>K and Q against K and R. Freeborough has devoted an entire
volume to this ending, which may be very much prolonged by a
skilful player. The object is to drive the King to the edge of the
board, and then to get the Rook in such a position that it must be
sacrificed to save the mate, or that the mate can be accomplished
with the Rook on the board. The player with the Queen must be
on his guard against stale-mate in this ending.</p>

<p>K and Q against K and B, K and Kt, or K and P. This is
easy enough for the Queen if the player is careful to avoid stale-mate.</p>

<p>K and two R’s against K and R. This can be won easily by
forcing an exchange of Rooks.</p>

<p>K and two B’s against K. In this position the King must be
ruled off into a corner by getting the Bishops together, protected
by their King. Start with the men in the following position:&mdash;</p>

<p>Black K on his own square. White King on K B 6; white
Bishops on K B 4 and K B 5. White to move and win. The mate
can be accomplished in six moves, as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="chess">

<p>K, B and Kt against K. This is one of the most difficult
endings for a beginner, but is very instructive, and should be carefully
studied. Set up the men as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Black King on K R sq. White King on K B 6, white Bishop on
K B 5, and white Knight on K Kt 5; White to move and win.
The object is to drive the King into a corner of the board which is
commanded by the Bishop, as he cannot otherwise be mated.</p>

<p><i><b>PAWN ENDINGS.</b></i> There are a great number of these,
many being complicated by the addition of Pawns to other pieces.
The following example, which is a position that often occurs, should
be understood by the beginner:&mdash;</p>

<p>Put the black King on K B square; the white King on K B 6,
and a white Pawn on K 6. If it is Black’s move, White can win
easily; but if it is White’s move it is impossible to win, because
whether he checks or not the black King gets in front of the Pawn
and either wins it or secures a stale-mate.</p>

<p>Put the Pawn behind the King, on K B 5, and White wins, no
matter which moves first, for if Black moves he allows the white
King to advance to the seventh file, which will queen the Pawn.
If White moves first, and the black King keeps opposite him, the
Pawn advances. If Black goes in the other direction, the white
King goes to the seventh file and wins by queening the Pawn.</p>

<p>If the white King and Pawn are both moved one square further
back, the King on K B 5, and the Pawn on K B 4. the win will depend
on the move. If it is White’s move he can win by advancing
the King; but if it is Black’s move he can draw by keeping his
King always opposite the white King. If the Pawn advances, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
will get in front of it, and if the King is afterward advanced, he
will get in front of it; winning the Pawn or securing a stale-mate.</p>

<p><i><b>THE KNIGHT’S TOUR.</b></i> Owing to the peculiarity of the
Knight’s move, many persons have amused themselves in trying to
cover the entire chess board with a Knight, touching the same
square once only, and returning to the starting-point again. There
are several ways of doing this, one of the simplest being the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p570.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Chessboard with the squares numbered in the order the Knight should jump on them" />
</div>

<p><i><b>TEXT BOOKS.</b></i> Among the very large number of works on
Chess there is abundant room for choice, but the following works
are considered standard authorities on the game:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Freeborough’s Chess Openings, 1896.</li>
<li>Cook’s Synopsis.</li>
<li>Minor Tactics of Chess, by Young and Howell.</li>
<li>Modern Chess Instructor, by W. Steinitz.</li>
<li>Common Sense in Chess, by E. Lasker.</li>
<li>Walker’s Treatise on Chess, 1841.</li>
<li>Handbuch des Schachspiels.</li>
<li>Lehrbuch des Schachspiels, by J. Dufresne.</li>
<li>Teoria e Practica del Giuoco degli Schacchi.</li>
<li>British Chess Magazine.</li>
<li>Chess Player’s Chronicle.</li>
<li>Chess Monthly.</li>
<li><i>Westminster Papers</i>, 1868 to 1879.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these works, “Minor Tactics” will be found most useful to
the beginner, as it simplifies the openings by grouping them, and
concentrates the attention on the essential points of chess strategy.</p>

<h4>CODE OF CHESS LAWS.<br />
ADOPTED BY THE FIFTH AMERICAN CHESS CONGRESS.</h4>

<p><i><b>Definitions of Terms Used.</b></i> Whenever the word “<i>Umpire</i>”
is used herein, it stands for any Committee having charge
of Matches or Tournaments, with power to determine questions
of chess-law and rules; or for any duly appointed Referee,
or Umpire; for the bystanders, when properly appealed to; or
for any person, present or absent, to whom may be referred any
disputed questions; or for any other authority whomsoever having
power to determine such questions.</p>

<p>When the word “<i>move</i>” is used it is understood to mean a
legal move or a move to be legally made according to these laws.</p>

<p>When the word “<i>man</i>” or “<i>men</i>” is used, it is understood that
it embraces both Pieces and Pawns.</p>

<p><i><b>The Chess-Board and Men.</b></i> The Chess-board must be
placed with a white square at the right-hand corner.</p>

<p>If the Chess-board be wrongly placed, it cannot be changed
during the game in progress after a move shall have been made
by each player, provided the men were correctly placed upon the
board at the beginning, <i>i.e.</i>, the Queens upon their own colours.</p>

<p>A deficiency in number, or a misplacement of the men, at the
beginning of the game, when discovered, annuls the game.</p>

<p>The field of the Standard Chess-board shall be twenty-two
inches square.</p>

<p>The Standard Chess-men shall be of the improved Staunton
Club size and pattern.</p>

<p><i><b>First Move and Colour.</b></i> The right of first move must be
determined by lot.</p>

<p>The player having the first move must always play with the
white men.</p>

<p>The right of move shall alternate, whether the game be won,
lost or drawn.</p>

<p>The game is legally begun when each player shall have made
his first move.</p>

<p>Whenever a game shall be annulled, the party having the move
in that game shall have it in the next game. An annulled game
must be considered, in every respect, the same as if it had never
been begun.</p>

<p><i><b>Concessions.</b></i> The concession of an indulgence by one player
does not give him the right of a similar, or other, indulgence from
his opponent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Errors.</b></i> If, during the course of the game, it be discovered
that any error or illegality has been committed, the moves must
be retraced and the necessary correction made, without penalty.
If the moves cannot be correctly retraced, the game must be
annulled.</p>

<p>If a man be dropped from the board and moves made during its
absence, such moves must be retraced and the man restored. If
this cannot be done, to the satisfaction of the Umpire, the game
must be annulled.</p>

<p><i><b>Castling.</b></i> The King can be Castled only:</p>

<p>When neither the King nor the Castling Rook has been moved,
and</p>

<p>When the King is not in check, and</p>

<p>When all the squares between the King and Rook are unoccupied,
and</p>

<p>When no hostile man attacks the square on which the King is
to be placed, or the square he crosses.</p>

<p>In Castling, the King must be first moved.</p>

<p>The penalty of moving the King prohibits Castling.</p>

<p><i><b>En Passant.</b></i> Taking the Pawn “<i>en passant</i>,” when the only
possible move, is compulsory.</p>

<p><i><b>Queening the Pawn.</b></i> A pawn reaching the eighth square
must be at once exchanged for any piece (except the King) that
the player of the Pawn may elect.</p>

<p><i><b>Check.</b></i> A player falsely announcing “check,” must retract the
move upon which the announcement was based and make some
other move, or the move made must stand at the option of the opponent.</p>

<p>No penalty can be enforced for any offence committed against
these rules in consequence of a false announcement of “check,”
nor in consequence of the omission of such announcement, when
legal “check” be given.</p>

<p><i><b>“J’adoube.”</b></i> “J’adoube,” “I adjust,” or words to that
effect, cannot protect a player from any of the penalties imposed
by these laws, unless the man or men touched, obviously <i>need</i>
adjustment, and unless such notification be distinctly uttered <i>before</i>
the man, or men, be touched, and only the player whose turn it is
to move is allowed so to adjust.</p>

<p>The hand having once quitted the man, but for an instant, the
move must stand.</p>

<p>Men overturned or displaced accidentally may be replaced by
either player, without notice.</p>

<p>A wilful displacement, or overturning of any of the men, forfeits
the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Penalties.</b></i> Penalties can be enforced only at the time an
offence is committed, and before any move is made thereafter.</p>

<p>A player touching one of his men, when it is his turn to play,
must move it. If it cannot be moved he must move his King. If
the King cannot move, no penalty can be enforced.</p>

<p>For playing two moves in succession, the adversary may elect
which move shall stand.</p>

<p>For touching an adversary’s man, when it cannot be captured,
the offender must move his King. If the King cannot move, no
other penalty can be enforced. But if the man touched can be
legally taken, it must be captured.</p>

<p>For playing a man to a square to which it cannot be legally
moved, the adversary, at his option, may require him to move the
man legally, or to move the King.</p>

<p>For illegally capturing an adversary’s man, the offender must
move his King, or legally capture the man, as his opponent may
elect.</p>

<p>For attempting to Castle illegally, the player doing so must
move either the King or Rook, as his adversary may dictate.</p>

<p>For touching more than one of the player’s own men, he must
move either man that his opponent may name.</p>

<p>For touching more than one of the adversary’s men, the offender
must capture the one named by his opponent, or if <i>either</i> cannot
be captured, he may be required to move the King or capture the
man which can be taken, at the adversary’s option; or, if <i>neither</i>
can be captured, then the King must be moved.</p>

<p>A player moving into check may be required, by the opposing
player, either to move the King elsewhere, or replace the King and
make some other move&mdash;but such other move shall not be selected
by the player imposing the penalty.</p>

<p>For discovering check on his own King, the player must either
legally move the man touched, or move the King at his adversary’s
option. In case neither move can be made, there shall be
no penalty.</p>

<p>While in check, for touching or moving a man which does not
cover the check, the player may be required to cover with another
piece, or move the King, as the opposing player may elect.</p>

<p><i><b>Touching the Squares.</b></i> While the hand remains upon a
man, it may be moved to any square that it commands, except
such squares as may have been touched by it during the deliberation
on the move; but if all the squares which it commands have
been so touched, then the man must be played to such of the
squares as the adversary may elect.</p>

<p><i><b>Counting Fifty Moves.</b></i> If, at any period during a game,
either player persist in repeating a particular check, or series of
checks, or persist in repeating any particular line of play which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
does not advance the game; or if “<i>a game-ending</i>” be of doubtful
character as to its being a win or a draw, or if a win be possible,
but the skill to force the game questionable, then either player
may demand judgment of the Umpire as to its being a proper
game to be determined as drawn at the end of fifty additional
moves, on each side; or the question: “Is, or is not the game a
draw?” may be, by mutual consent of the players, submitted to
the Umpire at any time. The decision of the Umpire, in either
case, to be final.</p>

<p>And whenever fifty moves are demanded and accorded, the
party demanding it may, when the fifty moves have been made,
claim the right to go on with the game, and thereupon the other
party may claim the fifty move rule, at the end of which, unless
mate be effected, the game shall be decided a draw.</p>

<p><i><b>Stale-Mate.</b></i> A stale-mate is a drawn game.</p>

<p><i><b>Time Limit.</b></i> The penalty for exceeding the time limit is the
forfeiture of the game.</p>

<p>It shall be the duty of each player, as soon as his move be
made, to stop his own register of time and start that of his opponent,
whether the time be taken by clocks, sand-glasses, or otherwise.
No complaint respecting an adversary’s time can be considered,
unless this rule be strictly complied with. But nothing
herein is intended to affect the penalty for exceeding the time limit
as registered.</p>

<p><i><b>Abandoning the Game.</b></i> If either player abandon the game
by quitting the table in anger, or in any otherwise offensive manner;
or by momentarily resigning the game; or refuses to abide by
the decision of the Umpire, the game must be scored against him.</p>

<p>If a player absent himself from the table, or manifestly ceases to
consider his game, when it is his turn to move, the time so consumed
shall, in every case, be registered against him.</p>

<p><i><b>Disturbance.</b></i> Any player wilfully disturbing his adversary
shall be admonished; and if such disturbance be repeated, the
game shall be declared lost by the player so offending, provided
the player disturbed then appeals to the Umpire.</p>

<p><i><b>The Umpire.</b></i> It is the duty of the Umpire to determine all
questions submitted to him according to these laws, when they
apply, and according to his best judgment when they do not
apply.</p>

<p>No deviation from these laws can be permitted by an Umpire,
even by mutual or general consent of the players, after a match or
tournament shall have been commenced.</p>

<p>The decision of the Umpire is final, and binds both and all the
players.</p>

<h5>RULES FOR PLAYING THE GAME AT ODDS.</h5>

<p>I. In games where one player gives the odds of a piece, or
“the exchange,” or allows his opponent to count drawn games as
won, or agrees to check-mate with a particular man, or on a particular
square, he has the right to choose the men, and to move
first, unless an arrangement to the contrary is agreed to between
the combatants.</p>

<p>II. When the odds of Pawn and one move, or Pawn and more
than one move are given, the Pawn given must be the King’s
Bishop’s Pawn when not otherwise previously agreed on.</p>

<p>III. When a player gives the odds of his King’s or Queen’s
Rook, he must not Castle (or more properly speaking leap his
King) on the side from which the Rook is removed, unless before
commencing the game or match he stipulates to have the privilege
of so doing.</p>

<p>IV. When a player undertakes to give check-mate with one of
his Pawns, or with a particular Pawn, the said Pawn must not be
converted into a piece.</p>

<p>V. When a player accepts the odds of two or more moves, he
must not play any man beyond the fourth square, <i>i.e.</i>, he must
not cross the middle line of the board, before his adversary makes
his first move. Such several moves are to be collectively considered
as the first move of the player accepting the odds.</p>

<p>VI. In the odds of check-mating on a particular square it must
be the square occupied by the King mated, not by the man giving
the mate.</p>

<p>VII. The player who undertakes to win in a particular manner,
and either draws the game, or wins in some other manner,
must be adjudged to be the loser.</p>

<p>In all other respects, the play in games at odds must be governed
by the regulations before laid down.</p>

<h5>RULES FOR PLAYING CORRESPONDENCE AND CONSULTATION
GAMES.</h5>

<p>I. In playing a game by correspondence or in consultation, the
two parties shall always agree beforehand in writing or otherwise
as to the persons who are to take part in the contest, as to the
time and mode of transmitting the moves, as to the penalties to be
inflicted for any breach of the contract, and as to the umpire or
referee.</p>

<p>II. In games of this description each party is bound by the
move dispatched; and in this connection the word move refers to
what is intelligibly written, or delivered <i>viva voce</i>.</p>

<p>In any game the announcement of a move which does not include
the actual transfer of a man from one square to another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
shall be considered as a move not intelligibly described within the
meaning of this section.</p>

<p>III. Each party must be bound by the move communicated in
writing, or by word of mouth, to the adversary whether or not it
be made on the adversary’s board. If the move so communicated
should prove to be different from that actually made on the party’s
own board, the latter must be altered to accord with the former.</p>

<p>IV. If either party be detected in moving the men when it is
not their turn to play, or in moving more than one man (except in
castling) when it is their turn to play, they shall forfeit the game,
unless they can show that the man was moved for the purpose of
adjusting or replacing it.</p>

<p>V. If either party has, accidentally or otherwise, removed a
man from the board, which has not been captured in the course of
the game, and made certain moves under the impression that such
man was no longer in play, the moves must stand, but the man
may be replaced whenever the error is discovered.</p>

<p>VI. If either party permit a bystander to take part in the contest,
that party shall forfeit the game.</p>

<p class="tb">The foregoing laws differ very slightly from those of the British
Chess Association, and it is to be hoped that an international code
will be agreed upon before a second edition of this work is issued.</p>

<h3>CHECKERS, OR DRAUGHTS.</h3>

<p><i><b>The Board.</b></i> Checkers is played upon a board which is not
more than sixteen, nor less than fourteen inches square, and is
divided into sixty-four smaller squares of equal size. These
squares are of different colours, alternately light and dark, and the
board must be so placed that each player shall have a light square
at his right on the side nearer him.</p>

<p><i><b>The Men.</b></i> Each player is provided with twelve men, which
are circular in form, one inch in diameter, and three eighths thick.
The men on one side are red or black; those on the other white or
yellow. The men must be placed on the <i><b>black</b></i> squares.</p>

<p><i><b>Diagrams.</b></i> For convenience in illustrating games and problems
the men are always shown as placed on the white squares,
type made in that manner being more easily read. The following
diagram will show the proper arrangement of the men at the beginning
of the game, if the white squares are supposed to be black
ones:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p577.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Checkerboard showing the layout described" />
</div>

<p><i><b>Two Move Restriction.</b></i> It has lately become the custom
in important tournaments to write an opening and second move,
such as 10-14, 22-17 on a slip of paper; 10-14, 24-19 on another,
and so on for all possible openings. These are placed in a
hat and when the players face each other, a slip is drawn. If
it is 11-15, 22-18, the game must be opened with those moves.
When these players start the second game, the one who was
second player on the first game begins with 11-15, and his
opponent must play 22-18. The same opening is never again
used by the same pair, the object being to diversify the play
and drive contestants out of their favourite ruts.</p>

<p><i><b>The Players</b></i> are designated by the colour of the men with
which they play, White or Black, and Black always has the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
move. In a series of games each player in turn takes the black
men and the move. It is usual to draw for the first game, one
player concealing in each hand a man of different colour, and offering
the choice of hands to his adversary. Whichever colour the
chosen hand contains the chooser must take for the first game.</p>

<p><i><b>The Moves.</b></i> The men never leave the colour of the squares
on which they are originally set up, so that they always move diagonally.
At the beginning of the game the men move only one
square at a time, and always forward, and can be placed only on
squares which are unoccupied. If an adverse piece stands upon a
square to which a man might be moved, and there is a vacant
square beyond, the man must jump
over the adverse piece to the unoccupied
square, at the same time removing
from the board the piece so jumped
over. In the position shown in Diagram
No. 1, for instance, it being
White’s turn to move, he must jump
over the black man, removing it from
the board. Black will then have a
choice of two jumps, over one man or
over two, and will of course select the
jump toward the right of the board
first, and then over the second man,
removing both from the board. A
man may jump over and capture several men at one move, provided
there are vacant squares between them, and beyond the last
man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p578.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Checkerboard showing the layout described" />
<p class="caption">No. 1.</p>
</div>

<p><i><b>Huffing.</b></i> If a player who can capture a piece neglects to do
so, his adversary has the choice of three things:&mdash;To compel the
player to take back his move and capture the piece; to huff
(remove from the board,) the man that should have captured the
piece; or to let the move stand, and go on with his own move. A
huff does not constitute a move; the piece is simply removed from
the board as a penalty, but the penalty must be enforced before the
player exacting it makes his own move.</p>

<p><i><b>Kings.</b></i> When a man arrives at any of the four squares on
the edge of the board farthest from the side on which he started,
he becomes a King, and is <i><b>crowned</b></i> by putting another man of
the same colour on the top of him. In diagrams, kings are distinguished
by putting a ring round the single man. ⦾ ⦿. Kings can
move either backward or forward, but only one square at a time.
If a man arrives at the king-row by capturing an adverse piece,
that ends the move, and the newly made king cannot move again,
even to capture another piece, until his adversary has moved. [See
notes to Diagram No. 7.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>The Object of the Game</b></i> is to confine your adversary’s pieces
so that he cannot move any of them; or to capture all of them, so
that he has none to move. You may succeed in confining the
whole twelve of your adversary’s men, without capturing any of
them, as in Diagram No. 2; or such as are left on the board after a
certain number have been captured, as in Diagram No. 3.</p>

</div>

<p>Diagram No. 2 is the ending of our Illustrative Game No. 7.</p>

<p>In No. 3, White gives away a man, bottling up the three black
men, and then catches the other black man. In both these examples
it will then be Black’s move, and as he cannot move, White
wins.</p>

<p><i><b>Notation.</b></i> The various moves which take place in the course
of a game are recorded by giving each square on the board a
number, and putting down the number of the square the man is
moved from, and the one it is moved to. Only those squares
upon which the men stand are numbered, and the black men are
always supposed to be originally placed upon the lower numbers,
from 1 to 12; the white men being placed upon the squares numbered
from 21 to 32. Diagrams Nos. 4 and 5 show the method of
numbering the board, and the men placed in position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span></p>

<p>In checker notation the number of the move is never given, as
it is in Chess. The moves of the black men are distinguished
from those of the white men by being hyphenated, but there are
no marks to show when pieces are captured. Letters or figures
in the margins are used to refer to possible variations in the play.</p>

<p><i><b>Openings.</b></i> There are a number of standard openings in
Checkers which are formed by the preliminary moves on each
side. These openings are known by various fanciful names, dear
to all checker-players. In the following list they are arranged in
alphabetical order for convenience in reference.</p>

<p><i><b>The Middle Game.</b></i> The best way for the student to learn
the manner in which the various openings are followed up, is to
play over illustrative games, and in doing so he should be careful
always to play with the winning side next him. In selecting openings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
take those that show the greatest number of wins for the
side you propose to play. In all checker books there are marks at
the foot of the column to show which side has an advantage, if
any exists, at the end of each variation. The Alma, for instance,
shows a great many more winning variations for the black men
than for the white, and is consequently one of the best openings
for Black.</p>

<p>Any person who plays correctly can always be sure of avoiding
defeat; that is, no one can beat him if he makes no slips, and the
worst he can get is a draw. It is a common error to suppose that
the first move is an advantage. [See Illustrative Game No. 7.]</p>

<p>The strategy of the game consists in so deploying your men that
alluring openings are left for your adversary. These openings are
always pitfalls of the most dangerous character, and whenever you
think a good player has made a mistake and left you a chance,
you should examine the position with great care, or you will probably
walk into a trap. The first of the example games given in
this work is a case in point. White’s move, 27 24, is apparently
the best possible, yet it immediately and hopelessly loses the game.
Sometimes these traps are set very early in the opening, and sometimes
after the pieces have been pretty well developed.</p>

<p>There are many cases in which a good player may take advantage
of the weakness of an adversary by making moves which are
really losing moves, and which would lead to immediate defeat if
he were opposed by an expert. But if he feels that his adversary
is not skilful enough to take advantage of these losing moves, a
winning position may sometimes be rapidly obtained by departing
from the regular development of the opening.</p>

<p>The beginner should be satisfied with learning only one or two
forms of the openings, committing to memory as many variations
as possible. When he meets with a line of play that beats him, he
should study out the variation in his text books, and see at what
point he made the losing move. To be perfect in any one opening
a person must know at least five hundred variations by heart;
but if he finds himself caught in a variation which he does not remember,
or has never learned, he should trust to good judgment
rather than to defective memory.</p>

<p><i><b>The End Game</b></i> usually resolves itself into one of four well-known
positions. These four positions are those in which there is
a win for one side or the other owing to the peculiar position occupied
by the opposing forces, although they may be numerically
equal. Every checker player must know these four positions
thoroughly, or he may abandon many a game as drawn which he
could win, and may lose many a game which he could draw.
These four positions are here given as they are usually found in
the books, but the player must be able to recognize at once any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
position which resembles them, or can be made to lead up to them.
The student will find many games marked as “won” in which he
cannot see any winning position unless he is familiar with the four
endings. The expert strives to exchange his men so as to bring
about one of these positions, after which he knows he has a won
game, although his less skilful adversary may be unconscious of
his advantage.</p>

<p>The first position is one of the most common endings on the
checker board, and should be very thoroughly understood. The
letters in the margin refer to the variations. There are a great
many minor variations, for which the student must be referred
to Janvier’s Anderson, page 265.</p>

<p><i><b>Traps.</b></i> The beginner should be on his guard against being
caught, “two for one,” especially in such positions as those shown
in Diagrams Nos. 6 and 7.</p>

<p class="caption">No. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>In No. 6, White will play 19 16, forcing you to jump, and will
then play 27 23, forcing you to jump again. In No. 7, White will
play 30 26, making your man a King. He will then play 32 28,
and wait for your newly made King to jump. This will give him
three of your men, and he will catch the other before it gets to the
king row.</p>

<p>Another common form of trap is to get a player into such a
position in the end game, when he has only one or two men, that
he cannot get to the king row without being caught; sometimes
because he is driven to the side of the board by the man following
him, and sometimes because the man meeting him can head him
off. The adversary can do this only when he has “the move.”</p>

<p><i><b>Theory of the Move.</b></i> When the position is such that you
will be able to force your adversary into a situation from which he
cannot escape without sacrificing a piece or losing the game, you
are said to have the move; and if he does not change it by capturing
one of your men he must lose the game. As the move is
often of the greatest importance in the end game, every checker-player
should understand its theory, so that he may know when it
is necessary to make an exchange of men in order to secure the
move, and when he should avoid an exchange which would lose it.
The move is only important when the number of men on each side
is equal.</p>

<p>In order to calculate the move, the board is supposed to be divided
into two systems of squares, sixteen in each. The first system
is formed by the four vertical rows running from your own side of
the board, as shown by the dotted lines in Diagram No. 8. The
second system runs from your adversary’s side of the board, as
shown in Diagram No. 9.</p>

<p class="caption">No. 9.</p>
</div>

<p>In order to ascertain if you have the move when it is your turn
to play, add together all the men, both black and white, in one of
the systems, taking no notice of those in the other system, and if
the number is <i><b>odd</b></i>, you have the move. In Diagram No. 10, for
instance, if you have the black men, and it is your turn to play,
you will find three men on your own system, and therefore you
have the move, and must win by playing 10-15. When White
moves, there will again be an odd number of men on your system,
and you will still have the move, and he must sacrifice both his
men.</p>

<p class="caption">No. 11.</p>
</div>

<p>In Diagram No. 11, if you count up the men on either your own or
your adversary’s system, you will find that the number is even, and
as you have not the move you should force an exchange immediately,
which will give it to you, and win the game.</p>

<p>Every single exchange of man for man <i><b>changes the move</b></i>
when only one of the capturing pieces remains on the board, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
the following rule is given for ascertaining how proposed exchanges
in complicated positions will affect the move:&mdash;The capturing
pieces of both black and white in both systems must first be
added together, and if the number agrees&mdash;in the matter of being
odd or even&mdash;with that of the number of captured pieces in each
system, the move will not be changed; but if one number so found
is odd, and the other is even, the move will be changed.</p>

<p><i><b>LOSING GAME.</b></i> In this variety of Draughts, the object is
to give away all your men before your adversary can give away his,
or to block yourself so that you cannot move. The secret of success
in Losing Game is to get your men on such squares that they
cannot be made to jump to the king row. These squares will be
the row next you on your own side of the board, and every second
row from that, horizontally. Get your men on those squares as
soon as possible, and do not be in too great a hurry to capture
your adversary’s men.</p>

<p><i><b>POLISH DRAUGHTS.</b></i> Although intended for a special
board of 100 squares this game can be played on a common checker
board. It differs from ordinary draughts in two particulars:</p>

<p>Although the men can move only forward, they can take backward,
and Kings can go any distance at one move.</p>

<p>If in taking a piece, a man arrives at the king row, that does
not end the move if he can capture another piece by jumping backward
out of the king row again. As this brings him away from
the king row before the move is complete, he will not be a king
until he can get to the king row at the end of a move.</p>

<p>Kings can go any number of squares
in a straight line, and can capture any
piece which is on the diagonal, not protected
by another piece behind it.
Kings can also go on for any number
of squares beyond the captured piece,
and then turn a corner to capture another
piece. In Diagram No. 12, for
instance, the black King could capture
all six of the white men by going over
the first one only, and then turning to
the left, and continuing to turn to the
left after every capture, as shown by
the squares with the numbers on them,
which indicate his five successive turning-points.</p>

<p class="caption">No. 12.</p>
</div>

<p><i><b>DEVIL AMONG THE TAILORS.</b></i> This is hardly a
variation of the game of Draughts, although it is played on a
checker board. Four white men, the tailors, are placed upon 29
30 31 and 32; and one black man, the devil, on 1. The men can
move only one square at a time, diagonally; the white men forward
only, the black man forward or backward. There is no
jumping or capturing, and the object of the tailors is to pin the
devil in, so that he cannot move. If the black man can reach the
free country behind the white men, he wins the game.</p>

<p>The game is a certainty for the white men if properly played.
At the end of four moves they should be lined up on squares 25,
26, 27, 28 and whichever end the devil attacks, the tailors should
move in from the other end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two critical positions.</p>

<p class="caption">No. 14.</p>
</div>

<p>In Diagram No. 13, if White moves 24 19 he loses, because Black
goes to 11, and as the tailors advance to head him off, he goes
back to 15 and 18, and then gets round by going to 14. White’s
proper play is 22 18, after which 26 22 will reform his line.</p>

<p>In Diagram No. 14, if White moves 26 22, or 19 15, he loses immediately.
In the first case Black will run to 15 and 11, and
either get round or double back to 18. In the second case Black
will get round by way of 7, or get through.</p>

<p><i><b>1.</b></i> The Standard board must be of light and dark squares, not
less than fourteen inches nor more than fifteen inches across said
squares.</p>

<p><i><b>2.</b></i> The board shall be so placed that the bottom corner square,
on the left hand, shall be black.</p>

<p><i><b>3.</b></i> The Standard men, technically described as White and Black,
must be light and dark (say white and red, or yellow and
black), turned, and round, not less than one inch, nor more than
1⅛ inches in diameter.</p>

<p><i><b>4.</b></i> The men shall be placed on the black squares.</p>

<p><i><b>5.</b></i> The black men shall invariably be placed upon the real or
supposed first twelve squares of the board; the white upon the
last twelve squares.</p>

<p><i><b>6.</b></i> Each player shall play alternately with the white and black
men, and lots shall be cast for the colour only once, viz., at the
beginning of the play&mdash;the winner to have his choice of taking
black or white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>7.</b></i> The first play must <i><b>invariably</b></i> be made by the person
having the black men.</p>

<p><i><b>8.</b></i> At the end of five minutes [if the play has not been previously
made], “Time” must be called by the person appointed
for that purpose, in a distinct manner; and if the play is not
completed in another minute, the game shall be adjudged lost
through improper delay.</p>

<p><i><b>9.</b></i> When there is only <i><b>one way</b></i> of taking <i><b>one or more</b></i>
pieces, time shall be called at the end of one minute, and if the
play is not completed in another minute, the game shall be adjudged
lost through improper delay.</p>

<p><i><b>10.</b></i> Either player is entitled, on giving intimation, to arrange
his own or his opponent’s pieces properly on the squares. After
the first move has been made, however, if either player touch
or arrange any piece without giving intimation to his opponent,
he shall be cautioned for the first offence, and shall forfeit the
game for any subsequent act of the kind.</p>

<p><i><b>11.</b></i> After the pieces have been arranged, if the person whose
turn it is to play <i><b>touch</b></i> one, he must either play it or forfeit the
game. When the piece is not playable, he forfeits according to the
preceding law.</p>

<p><i><b>12.</b></i> If <i><b>any part</b></i> of a playable piece is moved over an angle
of the square on which it is stationed, the move must be completed
in <i><b>that</b></i> direction.</p>

<p><i><b>13.</b></i> A capturing play, as well as an ordinary one, is completed
whenever the hand has been withdrawn from the piece played,
although one or more pieces should have been taken.</p>

<p><i><b>14.</b></i> The Huff or Blow is to remove from the board, before one
plays his own piece, any one of the adverse pieces that might or
ought to have taken but the Huff or Blow never constitutes a play.</p>

<p><i><b>15.</b></i> The player has the power to <i><b>huff</b></i>, <i><b>compel the capture</b></i>,
or <i><b>let the piece remain on the board</b></i>, as he thinks proper.</p>

<p><i><b>16.</b></i> When a man first reaches any of the squares on the opposite
extreme line of the board, it becomes a King, and can be moved
backward or forward as the limits of the board permit, though
not in the same play. The adversary must crown the new King,
by placing a captured man on the top of it, before he makes his
own move.</p>

<p><i><b>17.</b></i> A player making a false or improper move forfeits the
game to his opponent.</p>

<p><i><b>18.</b></i> When taking, if either player removes one of his own
pieces, <i><b>he</b></i> cannot replace it; but his <i><b>opponent</b></i> can either play
or insist on the man being replaced.</p>

<p><i><b>19.</b></i> A Draw is when neither of the players can force a Win.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
When one of the sides appears stronger than the other, the
stronger is required to complete the Win, or to show a decided
advantage over his opponent within forty of his own moves&mdash;to be
counted from the point at which <i><b>notice</b></i> was given,&mdash;failing which,
the game must be abandoned at Drawn.</p>

<p><i><b>20.</b></i> Anything which may annoy or distract the attention of
the player is strictly forbidden; such as making signs or sounds,
pointing or hovering over the board, unnecessarily delaying to
move a piece touched, or smoking. Any <i><b>principal</b></i> so acting,
after having been warned of the consequence and requested to
desist, shall forfeit the game.</p>

<p><i><b>21.</b></i> While a game is pending, neither player is permitted to
leave the room without giving a sufficient reason, or receiving the
other’s consent or company.</p>

<p><i><b>22.</b></i> A player committing a breach of any of these laws must
submit to the penalty, which his opponent is equally bound to
exact.</p>

<p><i><b>23.</b></i> Any spectator giving warning, either by sign, sound, or
remark, on any of the games, whether played or pending, shall
be expelled from the room.</p>

<p><i><b>24.</b></i> Should any dispute occur, not satisfactorily determined
by the preceding laws, a <i><b>written statement of facts</b></i> must be
sent to a disinterested arbiter having a knowledge of the game,
whose decision shall be final.</p>

<h3>BACKGAMMON.
OR TRIC-TRAC.</h3>

<p>Backgammon is played by two persons, each of whom is provided
with fifteen men, two dice, and a dice-box. The men on
each side are of different colours, black and white, and the players
are distinguished by the colour of the men with which they play.
The board is divided into two tables, <i><b>inner</b></i> and <i><b>outer</b></i>, and at the
beginning of the game the men may be set up in either of the
positions shown in the diagram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p591a.jpg" width="500" height="175" alt="Backgammon board; initial setup" />
</div>

<p>It will be observed that the black men on any point have exactly
the same number of white men standing opposite them. In
one table there are only two upon one point, and in the other
there are only three upon one point. The table with the two
men is always the <i><b>inner table</b></i> while the one with three is always
the <i><b>outer table</b></i>. This distinction is important, and may be
remembered by observing that the number of letters in the words
<i><b>in</b></i> and <i><b>out</b></i> are two and three respectively.</p>

<p>In setting up the men the inner table is always placed <i><b>toward
the light</b></i>, whether it be a window or the gas. Each player must
always have the majority of his men, five and three, on the side
nearer him; and the minority, five and two, on the side farther
from him. The side of the <i><b>inner table</b></i> which is nearer the player
will always be his <i><b>home table</b></i>. In all the illustrations in this
work you are supposed to be playing with the black side next you,
and with your inner or home table on your <i><b>left</b></i> hand.</p>

<p>The raised portion or hinge of the board, which divides the inner
from the outer tables, is known as the <i>bar</i>, and the points, or
flèches, in each player’s home table are numbered from 1 to 6,
reckoning from the outer edge toward the bar. These six points
are spoken of as the Ace, Deuce, Trey, Four, Five and Six points
respectively, and they correspond to the six faces on a single die.
The points in the outer tables have no numbers, but the one next
the bar on each side is called the <i><b>bar point</b></i>. In giving the moves
of the men in a game, the names of the six points in the home
tables are disregarded, and each player,
Black and White, numbers the board from
1 to 24, starting from the square on which
he has only two men. The notation for
the black moves would be as shown in the
margin; that for white being exactly opposite,
of course.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p591b.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Backgammon board showing the layout described" />
</div>

<p>The men on each side are always moved
in the direction of their notation numbers.
In all the following illustrations the black
men move round the board from right to
left, like the hands of a clock, while the white men go in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
opposite direction; so that the two opposing forces are continually
meeting and passing, like the people in the street.</p>

<p>The <i><b>Object of the Game</b></i> is for each player to move his men
from point to point in order to get them all into his home table.
It does not matter what part of the home table they reach, so that
they get across the bar. The men are moved according to the
throws of the dice, each player in turn having a throw and a
move. After the men on either side are all home, they are taken
off the board according to the throws of the dice, and the player
who is the first to get all his men off the board in this manner
wins the game.</p>

<p>If each player has taken off some of his men, the player getting
all his off first wins a <i><b>hit</b></i>, which counts as a single game. If one
player gets off all his men before his adversary has thrown off a
single man, it is a <i><b>gammon</b></i>, and counts as a double game. If
the loser has not only taken off none of his men, but has one or
more men left on the side of the board farther from him when his
adversary throws off his last man, it is a <i><b>backgammon</b></i>, and
counts as a triple game. In America, gammons and backgammons
are seldom played, every game being simply a hit. This
spoils some of the fine points of the game, and entirely alters the
tactics of the players, as will be seen when we come to the suggestions
for good play.</p>

<p><i><b>The Dice.</b></i> Although it is usual for each player to be provided
with two dice, some players insist on the same pair being used by
each player alternately; the claim being that luck will then run
more evenly. At the beginning of the game each player makes a
cast, either with one die or with two, as may be agreed, and the
higher throw has the first play. In some clubs the player making
the higher throw is allowed the option of playing the first cast, or
of throwing again; but the general practice is to insist that the
first cast is simply for the privilege of playing first, and that the
dice must be cast again for the first move.</p>

<p>After each throw the dice must fall within the borders of the
table on the caster’s right, and each die must rest fairly and
squarely on one of its faces. If it is <i><b>cocked</b></i> against a man, the
edge of the board, or the other die, or if it jumps over the edge of
the table in which it is thrown, both dice must be taken up and
cast again. The caster must announce his throw as soon as
made.</p>

<p><i><b>The Moves.</b></i> As the men on each side are moved round the
board in opposite directions to reach their respective homes, they
are of course obliged to meet and pass a number of the adversary’s
men, and they must pick their way among them by going to points
which are unoccupied by the enemy; for if there are two or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
of the enemy in possession of any point, that point is said to be
<i><b>covered</b></i>, and must be jumped over. If only one adverse man
occupies a point, it is called a <i><b>blot</b></i>, and the man may be captured,
as will presently be explained.</p>

<p>The numbers that appear on the upper faces of the two dice,
when they are thrown, are the number of points that each of any
two men, or that any one man may be moved at a time. If a
player throws four-deuce, for instance, he may either move one
man four points and another two; or he may move a single man
four points and two points, or two points and four points. He
cannot lump the throw and call it six points, because if the fourth
point from where the man stood was covered by two or more of
the enemy, the four could not be played with that man. If the
second point from where the man stood was also covered, he
could not be moved at all, although the sixth point from where he
stood might be unoccupied. If Black’s first throw is five-deuce, for
instance, he cannot move one of the two men on his adversary’s
ace point for the five, because the fifth point thence is covered.
Neither could he move one of them two and then five, because the
seventh point is covered also.</p>

<p>If a player throws <i><b>doublets</b></i>, that is, the same number on each
die, he plays the throw twice over. If a player throws double
fours, for instance, he can either move one man four points four
times; or one man four points once, and another man four points
three times; or two men four points twice; or two men four points
each, and then two other men four points, always provided that
the points moved to at the end of each four are not covered by
the enemy.</p>

<p>If there is only one of the adversary’s men on any point which
can be reached by a throw of the dice, the blot may be hit, a man
being moved to that point, and the adverse man taken from the
board and placed upon the bar. In the diagram in the margin, for instance,
it is White’s play, and he has thrown
six-four. Black has left a blot on White’s
four-point, and the single white man in the
outer table can reach this with the six
throw, taking up the black man, and placing
it upon the bar. White now has a
blot on his four point, which he should
cover by playing in a man four points from
the outer table, it being better to leave a
blot there than at home.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p593.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Backgammon board showing the layout described" />
</div>

<p>When a player has a man that has been
hit, and placed upon the bar by the adversary, he must re-enter
that man before he moves any others. He may choose for the
purpose either of the numbers on the next throw of the dice, and
must place his man on the point in the adversary’s home table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
which agrees with the number selected. Suppose that in the foregoing
example, Black’s next throw is five-deuce. He cannot enter
the man on the five-point, because it is covered by the enemy: so
he must enter upon the deuce point, which is not covered, and
must move some other man five points for the throw upon the other
die. If both the five and deuce points were covered, Black could
not enter on either of them, and as he cannot play until the man on
the bar is entered, the throw would be lost, and he would have to
wait until his adversary threw and moved in his turn. If two men
are upon the bar, both must be entered before any man can be
moved. A man may enter and hit a blot at the same time.</p>

<p>If a player could get his men round the board without any of
them being hit, seventy-seven points on the dice thrown would
bring them all home; but as every man hit has to start all over
again from his adversary’s home table, it may take a great many
throws to get all the men home. For this reason it is obvious that
each player should leave as few blots as possible, in order to save
his men from being hit; and at the same time he should strive to
cover as many points as possible, in order to prevent his adversary
from moving round the board freely. It is still more important to
cover points in the home table, so that when an adverse man is hit
he will have fewer points upon which to enter. It is, of course,
unnecessary to say that one can always enter or play on points
covered by his own men.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p594.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Backgammon board showing the layout described" />
</div>

<p><i><b>Throwing Off.</b></i> When either player has succeeded in getting
all his men home, he removes them from the board two or four
at a time, according to the throws of the dice, provided he has
men on the points in his home table corresponding to the numbers
thrown. If not, he must move his men up toward the ace point.
Doublets may take off four men if there are so many on the point.
If there are no men on a number thrown, and the number is so
high that the man farthest from the ace point cannot be moved up,
that man may be taken off. In the diagram in the margin, for
instance, Black has all his men home, and
is ready to throw them off. If he threw
six-deuce, having no men on either point
he would have to move up the deuce; but
the farthest man from the ace point cannot
be moved up six, so he can throw that
man off. This must result in leaving a
blot, no matter which man is played up
the two Points, and White may hit this
blot on his next throw. Should he do so,
Black would have to throw an ace to re-enter,
as all the other points in White’s home table are covered, or
“made up.” Black could not throw off another man until the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
hit had not only been re-entered, but had made the circuit of the
board and got home again.</p>

<p>A player is not obliged to throw off a man if he prefers to move,
but he must do one or the other. In the foregoing diagram, for
instance, if Black threw three-ace, he would be very foolish to take
off two men, leaving a blot on his three point. He should move
the ace from his four to his three point, and then take off the
three, leaving no blots.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> Always see that
the men are properly set up. It would be a great help to many
persons if the manufacturers of backgammon boards would print
upon them a small diagram of the correct position of the men.</p>

<p>The first thing for the beginner to learn is the proper manner of
playing the opening throws, and this should be practised with a
board and men. In some cases there are several ways to play the
same throw; double fours, for instance, it is said cannot be played
wrong. All possible throws of the dice, from double six to double
ace, and the various ways of playing them, are shown in the diagrams.
Black men only are moved, and those with white centres
have been brought from the points marked with a small cross x.</p>

<p>The best throws are those which cover the most points, take
possession of your own or your adversary’s five point, make up
your own bar point, or make up points in your home table.</p>

<p>Double aces are the best, because they make up two of the most
important points at once. A first-class player will sometimes give
an adversary the odds of a first throw of double aces. Double
sixes is the next best, and five-ace is considered one of the worst.</p>

<p>Three of these throws require special mention, all of which
would be very bad openings in the American game, for reasons
which will presently be explained. These throws are five-ace, four-ace,
and deuce-ace, when played as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 370px;">
<img src="images/p598.jpg" width="370" height="150" alt="Backgammon boards showing the layouts described" />
</div>

<p>These are all unfortunate opening throws, five-ace being especially
bad, and the English players think the best, perhaps because
the boldest, way to play them is to leave one or two blots, one of
which, however, lays the foundation for possession of your five-point
on the next throw, always a great advantage if you can secure
it. If neither of the blots are hit, the Englishman pushes
forward in the hope of gammoning his adversary, and so winning
a double game. In America, where gammons count no more than
hits, nothing is to be gained by taking such chances, and the foregoing
methods of playing these three throws would therefore be
considered very bad.</p>

<p><i><b>The English Game.</b></i> When the players count double and
triple games, it is not an uncommon thing to play for the gammon,
especially against inferior adversaries, or when one gets a decided
advantage at the start. The first thing is to secure your own or
your adversary’s five point, or both, and if you succeed in that you
should play a very forward game, and endeavour to gammon your
opponent. After the five-points, secure your bar point, so as to
prevent your opponent from “running” with double sixes. Some
players think the bar point better than the five point, but it must
be remembered that points in the home table are usually better
than any outside. If you get the five and bar points made up, try
for the four point, and after that you may take some risks to get
your men home, and do not take up your opponent’s men if you
are ahead of him, because they may give you trouble when they
re-enter in your home table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>The American Game.</b></i> When a gammon or backgammon
counts you nothing more if you win it, and costs you nothing
more if you lose it, the tactics of the game are entirely changed.
It is folly to take any risks for the sake of a gammon, and any
plays which leave unnecessary blots are very bad; for which reason
the three throws shown in the foregoing diagram would be
absurd in the American game. On the other hand, you may risk
being gammoned, or even backgammoned, if it is the only way to
save the game. An Englishman cannot take this risk, for he
might lose a triple game in attempting to save a single.</p>

<p>Secure the five point in your own and your adversary’s home
table as soon as possible, and then the bar and four points. After
the first few throws the player should take a general survey of the
board, in order to see whether he is ahead or behind, or if he has
any advantage of position. He must then decide whether he will
play a <i><b>backward</b></i> or a <i><b>forward</b></i> game. A glance at the relative
positions of the men will usually show if one side is much
more advanced than the other, without going into any minute
calculations as to how many points nearer home one side <i>may</i> be.</p>

<p>If, at the beginning of the game, one player makes two or three
large throws in succession, while his adversary gets small throws
only, the latter will have little chance of winning the game simply
by running for home, whereas the former’s best chance will be to
follow up his early advantage and get home as fast as possible.
The only hope for the man who is behind is that he can pick up
some of his opponent’s men, setting them back, and in order to do
this he must keep behind his adversary, so as to meet as many of
his men as possible.</p>

<p>This enables us to formulate the great principle of the American
game, which is that when a player is ahead he should go ahead as
fast as he can; and when he is behind, he should stay behind as
long as he can. In the first place he is playing a forward, and
in the second place a backward game.</p>

<p><i><b>The Forward Game.</b></i> The great point in this game, after
having obtained the advantage of several good throws in the
opening, is to get home as rapidly as possible without unnecessarily
exposing your men by leaving blots. Do not take up your
adversary’s men if you can help it, because by so doing you place
obstacles in your own path, and assist him by allowing him to
stay behind, which is just his game. Get past all his men if
possible, especially if he has moved his two men out of your home
table.</p>

<p><i><b>The Backward Game.</b></i> Exactly the opposite tactics are of
course the best for the player who is behind. He should keep
two or three men in his adversary’s home table, preferably on the
ace and deuce points, in the hope of catching some of the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
and setting them back. The result of these tactics, if successful,
will be to offset the advantage of the adversary’s high throws
early in the game, because every man captured not only has to
start his journey over again, but is liable to be picked up a second
or third time. As it is to the advantage of the forward player to
avoid picking up men, the one who is behind can leave blots with
great freedom, and may even spread his men so that some of
them must be taken up. This intense back game is peculiarly
American, for in the English game such tactics would usually result
in a gammon, and often in a backgammon, and the player
dare not risk so much just to save a hit. In the back game it is
very important to spread the men freely, so that they may act as
<i><b>catchers</b></i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p600.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Backgammon board showing the layout described" />
</div>

<p>In the position shown in the margin,
for instance, White has already thrown off
three of his men, but one has been caught
and set back. It is impossible for Black
to win unless he can catch this man
again, or capture one or two of those in
White’s home table, keeping White from
throwing off any more men until Black
gets home.</p>

<p>Suppose that in this position Black
threw double threes. His play would
be to separate all his men in the outer table, so that no matter
what White might throw he could hardly escape being caught.
The black men might be placed on the points marked with
small crosses, and then if the white man cannot be caught and
set back long enough for Black to get home, the game cannot
be saved. If Black succeeds in picking up this man, he should
then complete his home table as rapidly as possible, still keeping
his outside men spread, and not disturbing the two men on White’s
trey point until necessary.</p>

<p><i><b>Throwing Off.</b></i> Always throw off every man possible; never
move up instead of throwing off, unless there are some adverse
men in your home table. If you make a throw which will not take
off a man, do not move two men, but move up and take off one
man if possible.</p>

<p><i><b>Chances.</b></i> Some players profess to attach great importance to
the chances of the dice, but such matters are of little practical
value except in a general way. It may be interesting to know
that the odds were thirty-five to one against a certain throw, but
that knowledge does not prevent your adversary from winning the
game.</p>

<p>It should always be remembered that it is more difficult for your
adversary to hit a man that is very close to him or very far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
him, than one that is about
half way. The odds against
being hit by a given number,
either on one or on both dice,
are given in the margin. The
throws given in the second
column cannot be made without
counting both dice, and a
player is therefore safer when
it takes “double dice” to hit him.</p>

<h4>LAWS.</h4>

<p><i><b>1.</b></i> If the men are wrongly set up, the mistake may be
remedied if the player in error has not moved a man, otherwise
they must stand as set up.</p>

<p><i><b>2.</b></i> If a player begins with less than the proper number of men,
the error cannot be rectified after the player has made a throw for
his move.</p>

<p><i><b>3.</b></i> The players must each cast a single die for the privilege of
first move, the higher winning. Ties throw again.</p>

<p><i><b>4.</b></i> By mutual consent it may be agreed to let the higher throw
play the points on his own and his adversary’s die for the first
move; otherwise he must throw again with two dice.</p>

<p><i><b>5.</b></i> Each player must throw the dice into the table on his right
hand, and if either die jumps into the other table, or off the board,
both dice must be taken up and thrown again.</p>

<p><i><b>6.</b></i> To constitute a fair throw, each die must rest flat upon the
board, and if either die is “cocked” against the other, or against
the edge of the board or of a man, both dice must be taken up and
thrown again.</p>

<p><i><b>7.</b></i> If the caster interferes with the dice in any way, or touches
them after they have left the box, and before they come absolutely
to rest and the throw is called by the caster, the adversary may
place face upward on the die or dice so interfered with, any number
he chooses, and the caster must play it as if thrown.</p>

<p><i><b>8.</b></i> Before playing, the throw must be announced by the caster,
and if the throw is played as called it stands good, unless an error
in the call is discovered before the dice have been touched for the
purpose of putting them in the box again.</p>

<p><i><b>9.</b></i> If a player moves a man a wrong number of points, the
throw being correctly called, the adversary must demand that the
error be rectified before he throws himself, or the erroneous move
stands good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>10.</b></i> If a man wrongly moved can be moved correctly, the
player in error is obliged to move that man. If he cannot be
moved correctly, the other man that was moved correctly on the
same throw must be moved on the number of points on the second
die, if possible. If the second man cannot be so moved onward,
the player is at liberty to move any man he pleases.</p>

<p><i><b>11.</b></i> Any man touched, except for the purpose of adjusting it,
must be moved if the piece is playable. A player about to adjust
a man must give due notice by saying, “J’adoube.” A man having
been properly played to a certain point and quitted, must remain
there.</p>

<p><i><b>12.</b></i> The numbers on both dice must be played if possible. If
there are two ways to play, one of which will employ the numbers on
both dice, the other only one of them, the former must be played.
If either, but only one, of the two numbers thrown can be played,
the larger of the two must be selected.</p>

<p><i><b>13.</b></i> If a player throws off men before all his men are at home,
the men so thrown off must be placed on the bar, and re-entered
in the adversary’s home table, just as if they had been captured in
the course of play. The same penalty attaches to throwing off
men while one is on the bar.</p>

<h4>RUSSIAN BACKGAMMON.</h4>

<p>In this variety of the game, no men are placed upon the board
at starting, but each player enters his men by throws of the dice,
and both players enter upon the same table, so that all the men on
both sides move round the board in the same direction, and both
players have the same home table, which is always the one opposite
the entering table.</p>

<p>After having entered two men on the first throw, the player is
at liberty either to continue entering his men with any subsequent
throws, or to play the men already entered. In moving or in entering
a player may capture any blots left by his adversary; but
he cannot enter upon a point covered by two or more of the adversary’s
men. If a player cannot enter a fresh man with the throw
made, he must play a man if he can. When a man is captured,
he must be re-entered before any other man can be moved.</p>

<p>Except on the first throw of the game, doublets give the player
a great advantage. He can not only play the upper faces of the
dice twice over, as in the ordinary game, but the faces opposite
them also, and can then throw again before his adversary.
Should he again throw doublets, he would play both faces of the
dice, and throw again, and so on. As the opposite face is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
the complement of seven, it is not necessary to turn the dice over
to see what it is. A player throwing double four knows that he
has four fours and four threes to play and will then get another
throw. The upper faces of the dice must be played first, and if
all four cannot be played the opposites and the second throw are
lost. If the upper faces can be played, but not all the opposites,
the second throw is lost.</p>

<p>If the first throw of the game made by either player is a doublet,
it is played as in the ordinary game, without playing the opposite
faces or getting a second throw.</p>

<p>The chief tactics of the game are in getting your men together
in advance of your adversary, and covering as many consecutive
points as possible, so that he cannot pass you except singly, and
then only at the risk of being hit. After getting home, the men
should be piled on the ace and deuce points unless there is very
little time to waste in securing position.</p>

<h3>REVERSI.</h3>

<p>This game requires a special board of sixty-four squares. Two
players are each provided with thirty-two men which are red on one
side and black on the other. The first player sets a man on any of
the four squares in the middle of the board, and then his opponent
places another man in the same four squares, each player having
his own colour uppermost.</p>

<p>After the first move on each side, the object of each player is so
to set his men that they shall be next to an opposing man, but with
one of his own men in a direct line on the other side, horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally, no matter how far off the man in line
may be.</p>

<p>When a player succeeds in doing this, he reverses the colour of
all the intervening men, turning them to his own side. A man
placed at an angle may turn more than one line at a time. As
soon as the board is filled, each man counts up his colour, and the
one that has the majority wins the game.</p>

<h3>HALMA.</h3>

<p>This is played on a board with 256 squares, each player having
nineteen men of distinguishing colours. At the start the men are
placed in an enclosure at the corner of the board, called a “yard.”
The object of the player is to get his men out of his own yard and
into his adversary’s.</p>

<p>The men move one square at a time, like a king at chess, unless
a man gets to the square adjoining that occupied by another man
with a space beyond it. Whether the adjoining man is his own or
his adversary’s, the player can hop over it into the vacant space
beyond, and he can make as many hops as there are men and
spaces. This being so, a player will try to make “ladders” with
his own men, placing them in a line diagonally, with a space between
each, and will then hop his men over them all. As soon as he gets
all his men into his adversary’s yard the game is ended. Special
directions always come with the apparatus.</p>

<h3>GO-BANG.</h3>

<p>This is played on a board of 361 squares. Each player has his
own coloured counters, and they draw for the first move. Each
places a man in turn, and the first to get five men in a row, horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.</p>

<h3>MORELLES, OR NINE MEN’S MORRIS.</h3>

<p>This game, sometimes called <i><b>The Mill</b></i>, is played on a board
ruled off into compartments, as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p604.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Nine Men’s Morris board" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span></p>

<p>Each player has nine men, of distinguishable colours. They
draw for first move, and each in turn places a man on any one of
the corners or intersections of the lines. As soon as either player
gets three men in line, he can remove from the board any one of his
adversaries’ pieces that he pleases, provided the piece is not one of
three that are already in a line. If there are no other men on the
board, he can remove one of a line.</p>

<p>After entering all nine of his men, the player can shift them
about, one at a time, but no man can be moved farther than to the
adjoining corner or intersection, and that must be vacant. As
soon as a new line is formed in this way, an adverse man can be
lifted. It is possible for one man to move back and forth in such
a manner as to continually form and reform a line of three. When
one player has only three men left, he can jump any of them to any
vacant space on the board, no matter how far off. As soon as
either player is reduced to two men, the game is over and he has
lost.</p>

<h3>DOMINOES.</h3>

<p>Although properly a game for two persons, Dominoes is sometimes
played by four, two being partners against the other two.
There are also some round games in which any number from
three to six may play, each for himself.</p>

<p><i><b>The Sets.</b></i> A set of dominoes is a number of pieces of bone,
usually about 1½ inches by ¾, and ⅜ thick. These bones have
upon their faces the permutations of the numbers from six to
blank, taken two at a time. Some sets begin at double nine, and
others at double twelve; but the standard set is double six, and is
composed of twenty-eight pieces.</p>

<p><i><b>The Suits.</b></i> All the dominoes with the same
number upon either end belong to the same suit; the
seven bones with a 4 forming the 4 suit; those with
a 6 the 6 suit, and so on. The number of pips in
each suit may be easily remembered by observing
that the ace suit has the same number of pips as the
pieces in the set, 28; and that each suit above the
ace has seven pips more than the number of pieces
in the set, while the blank suit has seven pips less,
so that each suit progresses in regular order, seven pips at a time,
as shown in the margin.</p>

<p><i><b>Shuffling and Cutting.</b></i> Dominoes are provided with a
small brass pin in the centre of the face, which enables one to spin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
them round, push them about on the table, and so to shuffle them
thoroughly. There are three methods of determining who shall
have the first play, or <i><b>set</b></i>, as it is called: <i><b>1.</b></i> The player having the
higher double; or, failing any double in either hand, the <i><b>heavier</b></i>
domino, that is, one with a greater number of pips on its face
than any held by his adversary. <i><b>2.</b></i> One player selects any two
dominoes, face down, and pushes them toward his adversary, who
chooses one. Both are then turned up, and whichever gets the
lighter domino has the first set. <i><b>3.</b></i> Each player draws a domino,
face down, and the one getting the lower double sets first. If
neither draws a double the lighter domino sets.</p>

<p>The dominoes are then shuffled again by both players, and each
draws the number of pieces required by the game they are about
to play. The dominoes remaining on the table are left face down,
and form the <i><b>stock</b></i> or <i><b>bone-yard</b></i>. Each player should sort his
dominoes into suits, and either leave them standing on their edges
on the table with their faces toward
him, or hold them in his hand. Few
persons can hold more than six dominoes
in this way, so the seventh is left
upon the table, or is the first one set.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 235px;">
<img src="images/p606.jpg" width="235" height="300" alt="Six dominoes held in hand, one on table" />
</div>

<p><i><b>Matching.</b></i> All games of dominoes
are based upon the principle of
matching, or following suit; which requires
that each domino played shall
belong to the same suit as one of the exposed
ends of the line of dominoes already
played, and exposed upon the
table. In playing a domino, it must be
so placed that the end of it shall match
and adjoin the exposed end of the
line; a six being played to a six, a
four to a four, and so on. Each domino,
as played, is laid face upward on
the table, the ends abutting, and doublets being laid across, or at
right angles to the line.</p>

<p>The principal games are divided into two classes; those in which
the object is to <i><b>block</b></i> a player, so that he cannot follow suit, and
those in which the object is to make the ends of the line some
multiple of <i><b>five</b></i> or <i><b>three</b></i>. The Block Game will be described first.</p>

<p><i><b>THE BLOCK GAME.</b></i> Each player draws seven dominoes,
and the one whose turn it is to set lays down any domino he
pleases. If a good player, he will select one of his longest suit, especially
if he has three or more, and his object will be to get the
line back to his suit as often as possible. If a player had to set
with the hand of dominoes shown in the foregoing diagram, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
would select the 5-0, because he has four of the 5 suit, and three
of the 0 suit. This would compel his adversary to play some domino
having upon it a 5 or a 0. Let us suppose this adversary to
hold the following dominoes: 6-6, 6-3, 6-1, 6-0, 5-1, 5-0. He
would of course play the 6-0, in order to bring the line round to
his long suit of 6’s. As this would close the blank end of the line,
the first player, whom we shall call A, would have to play on the 5
end, as he has no 6. In order to get the line back to his second
longest suit, the blanks, he would play the 5-2, hoping to play 2-0
next time. His adversary, B, would play on this end if he could,
but being unable to do so, he gets rid of his heaviest domino, playing
the double six. A plays 2-0, and B should now bring in his
suit of aces by playing 6-1, which would win the game; but for
the sake of illustration we shall suppose that he foolishly plays 6-4.
A plays his double four, and the dominoes on the table present the
following appearance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/p607.jpg" width="500" height="100" alt="Dominoes laid out on the table" />
</div>

<p>B, having neither 4 nor 0 on any of his remaining dominoes,
says: “<i><b>Go</b></i>,” which signifies that he is blocked, and cannot play.
A can now play at either end, and with either of two dominoes;
but it would be bad policy to play the 4-5, because his adversary
might be able to play to the 5; but it is a certainty that he cannot
play to either 0 or 4. If A plays the 4-5, B gets rid of all his
dominoes before A can play again. If A plays the 4-0 on the
blank end, he will have to play again with his 4-5; but if he plays
it on the 4 end he blocks himself.</p>

<p>Whether to block the game or not depends on the probable
comparative value of the dominoes held by A and B. If A blocks
the game by making both ends blank, both players show their remaining
dominoes, and the one with the greater number of pips
loses as many points as he has pips in excess of the other player.
In order to judge whether to block or play, it should be remembered
that as there are 147 pips in the entire set, the average value
of each domino will be 5¼. If A blocks the game, he will have
17 pips left in his hand, which is above the average value of two
dominoes; but his adversary will have four dominoes to count,
and it is probable that they will be worth about 21 points. The
fact that the seven dominoes already played are 13 pips above the
average will reduce the probable value of B’s dominoes to about
20. On the other hand, A knows that B has no blanks, which
would slightly increase the weight of B’s dominoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span></p>

<p>If A blocks the game, as he should do with the odds in his favour,
he will win 7 points, the difference between his 17 and B’s
24. If he does not block, he must follow the 4-0 with the 5-4.
This will bring in B’s ace suit, bringing him back to his long suit
of 6’s. When the 5-1 was played, A would have to say, “go,”
and B would continue with 1-1, 1-6, 6-3, claiming <i><b>domino</b></i>, all
his pieces being exhausted. Although A can now play, it is too
late, for when one player makes domino he counts all the pips remaining
in his adversary’s hand; in this case, 8 points for B.</p>

<p>Had B played properly, by putting down 6-1, instead of 6-4, A
would have been compelled to play his 4-0, and B would have
made both ends 6’s, A saying, “go.” By then playing his double
ace, B would have made certain of domino next time by playing
the 6-3, for even if A could play to the 3, he could not shut B out
of the ace, and B’s 5-1 would make, him domino, winning 17
points.</p>

<p>The Block Game is sometimes played 50 or 100 points up, and
at the end the winner takes the stakes, if any, or settles at so
much a point for the difference between the scores.</p>

<p>In the <i><b>Four-handed Block Game</b></i> the players cut for partners,
the two lowest playing against the two highest, and the lowest
cut having the first set. Each player draws four bones, and
the play goes round from right to left. When any player is
blocked, and says “go,” the one on his left must play or say “go,”
also. The game is at an end when one player gets rid of all his
dominoes, or all four players are blocked. The pips remaining in
the hands of the partners are then reckoned, and the side having
the lower number wins the difference.</p>

<p>Another variation is for each to play for himself, but instead of
playing only one domino at a time in each round, a player may go
on as long as he can follow suit to either end of the line.</p>

<p><i><b>DRAW GAME.</b></i> In this variation of the Block Game, each
player has the option of drawing any number of dominoes from
the bone-yard except the last two, which must always remain in
stock. He may draw while he is still able to play, or not until he
is blocked; but when he is blocked he is compelled to draw until
he obtains a domino that can be played, or has drawn all but the
last two in the bone-yard.</p>

<p><i><b>MATADORE GAME.</b></i> This is another variety of the
Block Game. Each player takes seven bones, and the highest
double or the heaviest domino sets. The object is not to follow
suit to the ends, but to play a number which will make the end
and the number played to it equal <i><b>seven</b></i>. If the end is a 3, a 4
must be played; a 2 must be played to a 5, and an ace to a 6.
Four dominoes in the set are trumps, or Matadores. These are
the double blank, and the three dominoes that have seven on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
faces; 6-1, 5-2, and 4-3. Any of these trumps may be played at
any time on either of the ends, in order to prevent a block; but
the following player, if he does not play a trump also, must play
the complement of seven to whichever end of the matadore is
left exposed. Doublets are not placed crosswise, and count only
for the suit to which they belong; a double three cannot be
played to an ace, because it counts as three only. The trumps
are usually placed at right angles to the line. The game is
decided and settled for as in the ordinary Block Game.</p>

<p><i><b>SEBASTOPOL.</b></i> In this variety of the Block Game, four
persons play. Each takes seven bones, and the double six sets.
Nothing but sixes can be played until both sides and both ends
of the first set have been played to. When these five dominoes
have been set, any of the four ends may be played to. Each
player in turn must play or say, “go.” The game is decided and
settled for as in the ordinary Block Game.</p>

<p><i><b>BERGEN GAME.</b></i> Two persons play, each of whom
draws six bones. The highest double sets, and scores two points
for the <i><b>double header</b></i>. Two points are scored by the player
making both ends of the line the same. If there is a doublet at
one end, and one of the same suit at the other, it is a triple
header, and counts three. Fifteen points is game. In addition
to the headers, domino counts one. If both players are blocked,
the bones are shown, and the one having the smallest number of
pips and no doublet counts one toward game. If he holds a
doublet, his adversary scores one; but if both hold doublets, the
lower number of pips wins the point.</p>

<p><i><b>DOMINO POOL.</b></i> Any number from three to six can play,
and a pool is made up. They draw for the first set, and after
shuffling again, each player takes such an equal number of bones
as will leave at least eight in the stock. The leader plays anything
he pleases for the first set, and each following player must
follow suit if he can, to one end or the other. If a person cannot
play, he says “go,” and the player on his left plays or passes also.
When one makes domino he wins the pool. If all are blocked,
the smallest number of pips left in hand wins; ties divide.</p>

<p><i><b>MUGGINS, OR ALL FIVES.</b></i> This is a game for two,
three, or four players. The object is to make the two ends of the
line some multiple of five, and for every five so made the player
scores five points toward game, which is usually 100 up. If only
one point is scored for each five, 20 or 21 may be game. Each
player draws seven bones, and the highest double sets, each person
afterward playing in turn. If double five is the first set it
counts 10. The 5-0 played to this would count 10 for the second
player, because one end of the line being 10 and the other 0, the
total value of the two ends is still 10. Double blank played to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
this would count 10 more. If 5-6 is now played on one end, and
0-4 on the other, the count will be 10 again, as shown on the
diagram. The figures show the order in which the dominoes
were played.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 330px;">
<img src="images/p610.jpg" width="330" height="120" alt="Dominoes laid out on the table" />
</div>

<p>The highest possible score is 20 points, made with the 4-4 and
6-6, at different ends. If either player makes a multiple of five
without noticing or claiming it, his adversary says, “<i><b>muggins</b></i>,”
and scores it himself. If a player makes an erroneous score, it
must be taken down, and his adversary marks it as penalty.</p>

<p>When a player cannot follow suit, he must draw from the bone-yard
until he gets a domino that can be played; but the last two
in the stock must never be drawn. When one player gets rid of
all his bones, he calls <i><b>domino</b></i>, and scores the nearest multiple
of five that is found in the dominoes remaining in his adversary’s
hand. Remainders of 3 or 4 count as 5; those of 1 or 2 as nothing;
so that 12 pips would count as 10; but 13 would count as
15. The players usually settle at the end of the game for the
difference between their scores.</p>

<p>Muggins is sometimes varied by playing from both ends of the
first doublet set, as well as from the sides. It is not necessary to
play on the ends of the first set until one cannot play on the line;
but any of the four points may be played to at any time. The
end of the first doublet does not count in making multiples of
five, but the ends of any dominoes played to it must be counted.
If only one end of the first doublet has been played to, there will
be three ends to count to make multiples of five; and if both ends
of the first doublet have been played to, there will be four ends.
Every count must take in all the ends that are in play. The
highest count possible is 35; all four lines open, with the 6-6,
4-4, 5-5, and 0-5 at the ends.</p>

<p><i><b>ALL THREES.</b></i> Muggins is sometimes played by making
the object to get multiples of three at the ends, instead of multiples
of five. Otherwise the game is the same as All Fives.</p>

<p>There are several <i><b>card games</b></i> with dominoes, but they are
little used, and hardly worth description in a work of this kind.</p>

<h3>DICE.</h3>

<p>Dice are probably the oldest gambling instruments in the world.
Chatto thinks that man acquired the passion for gambling as soon
as he could distinguish odd from even, or a short straw from a
shorter. Simple gambling instruments were probably very early
articles of manufacture, and Chatto says that it is not unlikely
that after a simple dinner of mutton some enterprising gamester
may have taken the small bones from between the shank and the
foot, and after burning spots in them to distinguish one from the
other, put them into <i>a</i> cow’s horn and shaken them up, afterward
rolling them upon the ground. From some such beginning Astragali
was developed, a game which Dr. Thomas Hyde thinks was
known at the time of the Deluge. Later on, other instruments
were used in connection with dice, and so the earliest forms of
Backgammon were developed.</p>

<p>Dice are still the favourite implements for deciding any matters
of pure chance, such as raffling off a horse or a gold watch; but the
rules governing such lotteries are but imperfectly understood by
people in general. There are also a number of smaller matters,
such as the payment for refreshments or cigars, which are settled
by thousands of persons every day, simply by throwing dice. The
various methods of throwing, and the rules governing all such
games are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i><b>THE DICE.</b></i> Although dice may be of any size, the standard
pattern are half an inch square, of ivory or bone, with black
spots one tenth of an inch in diameter. The opposite sides of the
die always equal seven, and if the die is placed upon the table with
the ace uppermost and the deuce nearest you, the four will be on
the left and the three on the right. The positions of the three
and four are sometimes reversed to enable sharpers to distinguish
fair dice from those which have been doctored.</p>

<p>At the beginning of any dice game, it is quite unnecessary to
examine the dice to be used, because they are always fair.
Crooked dice are <i><b>rung in</b></i> during the game, and the player
should make it a point to examine the dice frequently if he has
any suspicions. First see that each die has all six figures upon it,
for some dice are <i><b>dispatchers</b></i>, made with double numbers, so as
to secure higher throws than the natural average. Double fives
are great favourites with backgammon sharps. The next thing is
to place the dice together in pairs, to be sure that they are exactly
the same height each way. If dice are not square they can be
made to roll over and over on the same faces. The faces should
then be tested to see that they are not convex, even in the slightest
degree. Shaped dice are usually flat on the ace and six faces,
especially in crap shooting. Each die should be held between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
thumb and forefinger at its longest diameter, to see if it has any
tendency to swing on a pivot, for if it does it is loaded. Even if
the dice are transparent, it is no guarantee that they are not
loaded in the spots. Loaded ivory dice soon get discoloured, and
the presence of any darkness in the corners is usually a sign of the
presence of mercury. It is a mistake to suppose that loaded dice
will always throw high or low; all they will do is to beat averages.
Finally, the dice should be tested with a magnet, as they are sometimes
made to work in connection with a battery concealed under
the table.</p>

<p><i><b>DICE BOXES.</b></i> Although the dice may be perfectly fair,
the box may be “crooked.” A fair box may be of leather, perfectly
smooth inside, or it may be of bone, ivory or wood, with the
interior “screwed” or grooved. If the upper edge of the inside
presents a sloping flat surface, slightly roughened with sand paper,
it will be just as well to refuse to allow such a box to be used, as
your adversary <i>is</i> probably an expert at <i><b>securing</b></i>, which is a
method of holding one of the dice securely against this upper
edge while the others are shaken and rattled about in the usual
manner. A person who is securing dice can be detected by the
manner in which he holds the box, keeping his fingers, instead of
his palm, over the mouth. When he turns the box face downward
on the table, he will still have his fingers under it, and will
withdraw them in regular order, the second and third fingers being
first separated.</p>

<p><i><b>THROWING DICE.</b></i> There are three methods of throwing
dice: The first is to shake them in the box with the palm
over the top, and then to shift the hold to the sides, completely exposing
the mouth. The box is then turned mouth downward on
the table, leaving all the dice completely covered. The box must
be lifted by the person who is recording the throws, in a raffle, for
instance, after the spectators have had time to assure themselves
that all the dice are covered. If the caster has his fingers over the
mouth of the box when he turns it over, or lifts the box himself,
the throw is foul.</p>

<p>The second method is known as rolling, or the <i><b>long gallery</b></i>,
and is generally used in poker dice and such games. After the
box has been shaken, the caster holds it by the side, and gives it a
twist and a push, which causes the dice to pour out, and roll along
the table.</p>

<p>The third method is called <i><b>shooting</b></i>, and is always employed
in craps. No box is used, the dice being held in the hand and
rolled along the table or the ground. The crap shooter is obliged
to shake the dice in his hand to show that he is not holding them
with certain faces together, which is a common way of preventing
or getting certain throws, especially with shaped dice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span></p>

<p>Whichever method is employed, each die must lie flat upon one
of its own faces after the throw, neither resting upon nor <i><b>cocked</b></i>
against any other die or any obstruction upon the table or the
ground. If any of the dice are cocked, all of them must be taken
up and thrown again.</p>

<h4>RAFFLING.</h4>

<p>In a raffle for prizes of any kind, each player has three throws
with three dice. The rules already given for throwing dice from a
box must be followed, the scorer placing the dice in the box before
each throw, and lifting the box after it. The total of the three
throws is recorded opposite the name of each player, and the
highest throw wins. The odds
against throwing a certain number
or higher are shown in the
margin.</p>

<p>Suppose the prize in a raffle is
a horse which would be worth a
hundred dollars to you. The
highest throw so far is 42, and
there are only twenty more
chances to be thrown. It is 2 to
1 that 42 is not beaten or equalled
because it is 39 to 1 that 42 is not
thrown, and there are only 20
more chances to throw it. If 45
had been thrown, and there were
still 21 chances to be thrown, you
would be safe in paying liberally
for the 45 chance. The great
mistake that people make in buying
or selling chances on throws
already made in raffles is in thinking
that because a certain number
has not been thrown, that therefore
it is likely to be. If there
are 116 chances, they argue that
44 or better should be thrown,
because that number or higher
should come once in 116 times.
This is quite right at the beginning of the raffle, but it is not
right to assume that because 100 of the 116 chances have been
thrown without reaching 44, that the odds are only 15 to 1 that 44
will not be thrown in the remaining 16 chances. The odds are
still 116 to 1 against 44, just as they were before the raffle began.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
If you are going back to take into account the previous throws of
the dice, you should know the 100 throws that were made with
those dice before the raffle began.</p>

<h4>CRAP SHOOTING.</h4>

<p>This game is a simple form of Hazard, and when played “on
the square,” is one of the fairest of all games, the percentage in
favour of either side being very small. It is rapidly replacing
Faro as the gambling game of America.</p>

<p>Any number of persons may play, and any one may be the
caster for the first throw. Two dice are used. The players bet a
certain amount of money, and the caster covers it, or as much of
it as he can. If the caster does not take all the bets offered,
players may back him against the other players. The bets made,
the caster shoots. If the total of the two dice on the first throw
is seven or eleven, it is called a <i><b>nick</b></i>, or <i><b>natural</b></i>, and the caster
immediately wins the stakes. If the first throw is two, three or
twelve, it is a <i><b>crap</b></i>, and the caster immediately loses. If the
caster throws any number, 4, 5, <i>6</i>, 8, 9, or 10, that number is his
<i><b>point</b></i>, and he must continue throwing until he throws the same
number again, in which case he wins; or throws a seven, in which
case he loses.</p>

<p>Two dice may come up in thirty-six different ways, each of
which will produce one or more of eleven possible throws, running
from 2 to 12. The most common throw is seven, because there
are six ways that the two dice may come that will make seven;
6-1, 5-2, 4-3, 3-4, 2-5 and 1-6. The most uncommon are two
and twelve, because there is only one way for each of them to
come; double aces or double sixes. The numbers of different
ways in which each throw may come are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="How the numbers may come up">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdc">7</td>
    <td>may come</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>When the caster makes his first throw, he has 8 chances out of
36 to get 7 or 11, which will win for him; and 4 chances out of 36
to throw 2, 3 or 12, which will lose for him. It does not follow
from this that the odds are 2 to 1 in favour of the caster, because
there are only 12 throws out of the 36 possible that will bring any
“action” on the bets; so that the odds are 2 to 1 that the first
throw will not settle the bets either way. After the first throw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
the caster’s chances vary according to his point. If his point was
six, he would have 5 chances out of 36 to throw it again, while the
players would have 6 chances out of 36 to get a seven. If the
player’s point is four or ten, the odds will be 6 to 3 against him;
because there are only three ways to get his point, while there are
six ways to get a seven.</p>

<p>If the caster wins he shoots again, but when he loses he passes
the dice to the next player in turn.</p>

<p>The old game of Hazard was a very complicated affair compared
to modern craps, an intimate knowledge of odds and probabilities
being requisite for success. The game was generally against the
caster, and certain throws were barred when a certain number was
the point. Those interested in the subject will find it exhaustively
treated in George Lowbut’s “Game of Hazard Investigated.”</p>

<h4>POKER DICE.</h4>

<p>If ordinary dice are used, the aces rank above the sixes, the
deuces being the lowest. Any number of persons may play, and
five dice are used. Each in turn takes the box and has three
throws, the first being made with all five dice. After the first
throw the caster may lay aside any of the five dice he chooses,
putting the others back in the box for a second throw. The same
process of selection is allowed for the third throw, any or all five
of the dice being available for the last throw. The second and
third throws have the same effect as the draw at Poker, except
that the dice player may draw twice if he wishes to, and may put
back all or any of the dice that he kept on the first or second
throws, or he may stand pat on any throw.</p>

<p>The object of the game is to secure pairs, triplets, full hands,
and four or five of a kind. Straights do not count in Poker Dice.
Suppose the player’s first throw to be a pair of sixes. He places
them on one side, and picks up the three other dice, throwing
them over again. If the second throw produced another six, it
would be placed with the first pair, making a triplet, and the two
remaining dice would be thrown again. Whatever they produced
would be the final value of his hand. The player is not obliged to
throw again, if he is satisfied with his first or second throw;
neither is he obliged to leave any pairs or triplets. A player getting
two small pairs on the first throw may put either or both of
them back in the box again if he chooses.</p>

<p>In throwing for drinks or cigars, it is usual to throw <i><b>horse and
horse</b></i>; that is, if several persons are in the game the highest man
on each round goes out, ties shake it off immediately, one hand
each. After it gets down to two men, they shake for the best two
out of three hands, and if each wins a hand they are horse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
horse, and throw a third to decide it. The last person to throw
on each round follows his lead, throwing the first hand on the next
round.</p>

<h4>TEN PINS WITH DICE.</h4>

<p>Any number can play, and the score sheet is ruled off for ten
frames, just as in ten pins. Only two dice are used, and they are
rolled from a box. Sixes count nothing, and are “off the alley.”
Each player has three balls or rolls, and he can leave either one or
both dice at the end of any throw. If he leaves one he picks up the
other and throws it again, but he must abide by the figures appearing
on the two dice at the end of his third throw. Suppose
he throws double fives on his first throw; that is a <i><b>strike</b></i>, and is
so scored, and the total pips appearing on the two dice at the end
of his second throw on the next frame will count on the strike.
Suppose he rolls five-deuce the first time. He leaves the five and
rolls the other die again, getting another five. That is a <i><b>spare</b></i>,
and the total pips on his first throw on the next frame will count on
the spare. If he does not get a spare, it is a <i><b>break</b></i>, and the total
pips on his two dice at the end of his third throw are scored.</p>

<p>It is usual to take up anything but fives on the first throw, on the
chance of getting a spare. If a spare is not thrown on the
second throw, most players leave anything as good as threes, and
always leave fours; but ace and treys are always thrown again.</p>

<h4>BASE BALL WITH DICE.</h4>

<p>There are two forms of this game. In the simpler any number
of persons may play, and three dice are used. Each player throws
in turn, the three dice representing his three strikes. Nothing but
aces count, but each of them is a run; and as long as a player
makes runs he goes on throwing. When each player has had nine
innings the game is ended, and the highest score wins.</p>

<p>The more complicated form of the game is to have a rough diagram
of a base-ball diamond. The players take sides, and each is
provided with three markers of different colours, such as red
and white poker chips. Only one die is used, and it is thrown
from a box. The captains of the teams throw for the first time at
the bat, the higher throw winning the choice. Each player in turn
of the side at the bat has one throw, and a marker is placed on the
base he reaches. Ace, deuce, and trey count for first, second, and
third bases respectively; four is a home run. When a five or six
is thrown, the result depends on the number of men on bases, but
the striker is always out. If there are no men on bases, or if all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
the bases are full, the player is out if he throws five or six. If
there is only one man on the bases and a five is thrown, the striker
is <i><b>caught out</b></i>, and the man on the base is also caught. If six
is thrown, only the striker is caught out, and the man holds his
base. If there are two men on bases, they must be in one of
three positions: on first and second; on first and third; or on
second and third. In any position, only the striker is out on six
thrown. In the last position, if five is thrown, the striker only is
out, as the men cannot run. If there are men on first and second,
and five is thrown, the striker is out, and the man on second is
caught trying to steal third; while the man on first holds his base.
If five is thrown when there are men on first and third, the striker
is out, and the man on third is safe, but the man on first is caught
trying to steal second.</p>

<p>When bases are thrown, they are safe hits, and all the men on
bases are advanced as many as the man at the bat throws. As soon
as three men on each side have struck or been caught out by throwing
five or six, the side is out, and all men left on bases count for
nothing. As long as three men are not out, the side continues to
send its men to the bat in regular order.</p>

<h4>GOING TO BOSTON.</h4>

<p>This game is known in the colonies as Yankee Grab, or Newmarket.
Each player has three throws with three dice, and the
highest die in each throw is laid aside. If two are equally high,
only one is retained. The others are returned to the box and
thrown again. The higher of these two is retained, and the third
die is thrown again. The final total of the three dice is the
player’s score, and the highest wins. In the colonies the ace
counts as seven. The game is usually played for a pool.</p>

<h4>ACE IN THE POT.</h4>

<p>Any number can play, and two dice are used. The game is for
a pool, which is won by the final possessor of a single counter.
At the beginning each player has two counters, and each in turn
throws the two dice. If he throws an ace he pushes one of his
counters into the pot; two aces gets rid of both. If he throws a
six on either die, he passes a counter to his left-hand neighbour,
who will have the next throw. Two sixes passes both counters if
the caster still has so many. The players throw in turn until all
the counters but one have been placed in the pot. If a player has
no counters, the throw passes him to the next player on his left
who has counters in front of him. The last counter of all cannot
be put in the pot by throwing an ace; but it must be passed along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
to the left when a six is thrown. The player with the last counter
in front of him must throw both dice three times in succession,
and if he succeeds in avoiding a six, he keeps the counter and wins
the pool. If he throws a six, the player who gets the counter must
throw three times, and so on, until some one throws three times
without getting a six. Instead of a pool, it is sometimes agreed
that the final holder of the last counter shall pay for the refreshments.</p>

<h4>MULTIPLICATION.</h4>

<p>Any number can play, and three dice are used. Each player
throws in turn, and the highest die is left on the table; if two are
equally high, only one remains. The two other dice are thrown
again, and the higher left. The sum of these two is then added
together, and the third die is thrown as a multiplier, the result of
the multiplication being the player’s score.</p>

<h4>ROUND THE SPOT.</h4>

<p>Any number can play, and three dice are used. Nothing counts
but the spots that surround a centre one; so that ace, deuce, four,
and six count as blanks. The trey counts as 2, and the five as 4.
Each player has three throws with the three dice, and the highest
total wins.</p>

<h4>VINGT-ET-UN.</h4>

<p>Any number of persons can play, making up a pool for the
winner. A single die is used, and each player in turn throws as
often as he pleases. The object is to get as near twenty-one as
possible without passing it, and it is usually considered best to
stand at 18, but to throw again at 17. If a player goes beyond 21,
he is out of it. The one getting nearest 21 takes the pool; ties
divide it.</p>

<h4>CENTENNIAL.</h4>

<p>Two persons or sides play with three dice. The object of the
game is to secure pips on the dice, or multiples of pips, which will
make the figures from 1 to 12 in numerical order, and afterward
the numbers from 12 to 1 again. The first side to accomplish
this wins the game. There must be an ace in the first throw or
nothing counts; that obtained, any following numbers may be
made singly, or by adding two or more together. Suppose the
first throw is 4, 2, 1. The 1 and 2 will make 1, 2 and 3. Then
the 4, 1, 2 will make 4, 5, 6 and 7. Each side continues to throw
until it fails to score, when the box must be passed to the adversary.
If a combination is overlooked by one side, the other may
count it if it continues the sequence on their side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span></p>

<h4>HELP YOUR NEIGHBOUR.</h4>

<p>Six persons play, with three dice, and five points is Game.
Each player has a number, from 1 to 6, and is provided with five
counters, and the first to get rid of them wins. Each player in
rotation has one throw, and no matter what he throws, the player
whose number appears on the upper face of any die thrown counts
one point toward game. If No. 2 should throw a four and two
sixes, for instance, he would count nothing himself, but No. 4
would count 1, and No. 6 would count 2 points toward game.</p>

<h4>PASSE DIX.</h4>

<p>Any player can be the banker for the first round, and he holds his
position as long as he wins. When he loses, he passes the box to the
player on his left hand. He has three dice, which he throws in one
cast, after the players have made their bets. If he gets ten or more,
he wins. If he gets less than ten, he loses. His advantage lies
in winning when he gets ten exactly; because that gives him nine
throws that win for him out of the sixteen possible with three dice.</p>

<h4>SHUFFLE BOARD.</h4>

<p>Shuffle Board is played on a table 30 feet long and 20 inches
wide, with a gutter running all round it. The board is sprinkled
with very fine sand. Four weights are used by each side, marked
A and B to distinguish them. These weights are of iron or brass,
2½ inches in diameter, and ½ inch thick. Five inches from each
end of the board and parallel with it is the deuce line.</p>

<p>The object of the game is to push the weights from one end of
the board to the other, each side playing one weight alternately
until all four weights on each side are played. All pieces over the
deuce line count 2, but if a piece hangs over the end of the board
it is a <i><b>ship</b></i>, and counts 3. If there are no ships or deuces, the
weight lying nearest to the deuce line counts one point. Only one
ship or deuce can be counted in each round, so that only one side
can score. The ship that overhangs the most, or the deuce nearest
the edge, counts. Twenty-one points is game. The sides play
from each end alternately.</p>

<p><i><b>On ship board</b></i>, the pieces are wooden disks, six inches in
diameter, marked with oughts and crosses. These are pushed
along the deck with long sticks that have enlarged and flattened
ends to fit the pieces. The object is to get each piece to settle
fairly and squarely within the borders of some one of a number of
spaces which are chalked out on a diagram about 10 feet by 6,
which is about 30 feet from the player. These spaces are numbered
from 1 to 10, and some of them are marked “minus.” Each
side has four shots with four separate pieces. Fifty points is game.</p>

<h2 id="BILLIARDS">BILLIARDS.</h2>

<p><i><b>THE TABLE.</b></i> The standard American billiard table for
championship games is ten feet by five; but that in common use
is nine by four and a half. The old tables for the four-ball game
had only four pockets, but all modern pool tables have six. The
English billiard tables are all twelve feet by six, with six pockets,
which are used for both billiards and pool. The head of the table
is the end from which the players make their opening shots, and
the foot is that on which the red ball is spotted. The baulk is the
space at the head of the table behind a line drawn from the second
diamonds or “sights” through the white spot. The “D” is the
semicircle on the baulk line on English tables.</p>

<p>American tables are made more difficult for championship
games by drawing baulk lines 8 or 14 inches from the cushions,
barring the rail nurse and the anchor shot. The English game is
made difficult by making the cushions higher, the pockets narrower,
and barring the spot stroke. The push shot is allowed in
the English game, but in America it is permitted only in pool;
never in the carrom game.</p>

<p>The American carrom game cannot be played on an English
table on account of the pockets. If the English game is played on
an American pool table the red spot should be only nine inches from
the bottom rail, and the “D” should be drawn with a radius of
eleven inches from the white spot on the baulk line. The D is
never marked on an American table, but the opening shot in the
three-ball game must be made from within a semicircle of six inch
radius from the white spot. In the four-ball game, and in all
forms of American Pool, the player may place his ball anywhere
within the baulk line.</p>

<p><i><b>THE BALLS.</b></i> The American standard balls are 2⅜ inches in
diameter, while the English are only 2-1/16. Billiard balls should be
carefully protected from sudden changes in temperature by being
laid away in bran or sawdust in cold weather. It is a mistake to
soak the balls in oil; all they need is to be wiped off with a damp
cloth, and polished with chamois skin. The three balls employed
in both the English and American games are known as the <i><b>red</b></i>,
<i><b>white</b></i>, and <i><b>spot white.</b></i> In play they are distinguished as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
<i><b>cue ball</b></i>, which is the one struck by the player; the <i><b>object ball</b></i>,
which is the one that the cue ball first comes into contact with;
and the <i><b>carrom ball</b></i>, which is the second ball struck by the cue
ball in making a carrom.</p>

<p><i><b>THE SHOTS.</b></i> There are three shots common to billiards:
The <i><b>carrom</b></i> or <i><b>cannon</b></i>, in which a count is made by the cue
ball striking both the other balls on the table. The <i><b>winning
hazard</b></i>, in which the object or the carrom ball is driven into a
pocket. The <i><b>losing hazard</b></i>, in which the cue ball goes into a
pocket after contact with another ball. There are five ways of
making the principal shots at billiards, and they should be thoroughly
mastered by every player. These are: The force, the
follow, the draw, the massé, and the side stroke.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p621a.jpg" width="300" height="130" alt="Diagrams of different shots" />
</div>

<p>The first great principle in billiards is that the cue ball will always
travel in the <i><b>direction</b></i> in which the cue is pointed. Holding
the cue upward, downward
or sidewise makes no difference;
the line of travel will be a prolongation
of the line of the cue.
In the three ways of striking the
cue ball shown in the diagram
in the margin, the ball will go
in the direction of the arrow in
each instance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p621b.jpg" width="300" height="100" alt="Diagrams of different shots" />
</div>

<p>If the cue is held nearly level with the surface of the table the
ball will be pushed or rolled along; but if the cue is held perpendicularly,
and the ball is struck directly on the top, the ball will be
<i><b>pinched</b></i> to the table, as in the first figure in the margin, and will
not move. If the ball is
struck off the centre, as in
the second figure, it will
travel only a short distance,
as a result of the cue’s being
forced past it toward the
cloth, and will then return
with a very strong retrograde
motion after touching the
object ball. If the cue strikes too near the top, the pinch will be
too strong for the cue ball to reach the object ball, and if the cue
is not held perpendicularly, the ball will not return. If the cue
points toward the centre of the ball, as in the third figure, the ball
will be driven forward, without any tendency to return after striking
the object ball. The latter shot is useful in making a “close
follow,” to avoid making a foul.</p>

<p><i><b>The Force Shot.</b></i> The beginner at billiards should strike his
ball always exactly in the centre, until he learns the angles. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
moderate strength the effect of the stroke is to cause the ball to
roll naturally along the cloth until it reaches the object ball, after
which it will be deflected from its original course according to the
angle at which the object ball is struck. If the cue ball is struck
very hard, however, and very slightly below the centre, it will
slide for a certain distance before beginning to roll, and if it
reaches the object ball before this sliding motion ceases it will
simply come to a stop, or go off at a right angle if the object ball
is not struck exactly in the centre. This method of forcing a ball
to go off at a right angle is called “screwing” in England.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p622a.jpg" width="300" height="80" alt="Diagram of a follow shot" />
</div>

<p><i><b>The Follow Shot.</b></i> If the cue ball is struck above the centre,
the rolling motion is set up at once, no matter how hard the ball
is struck, and the effect of contact with the object ball is simply to
check the motion for a moment, after which the cue ball rolls forward
again, deflected only by the angle at which the object ball
was struck. The great art in making follow shots is to let the cue
follow the ball, the tip passing at least three inches beyond where
the ball stood, as shown by the
dotted lines in the diagram.
When the balls are very close
together the cue must be lifted,
and the ball struck very much
on one side, the cue being behind
the centre, as shown in the third position in the diagram of
pinch shots.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p622b.jpg" width="300" height="70" alt="Diagram of a draw shot" />
</div>

<p><i><b>The Draw Shot.</b></i> This is exactly the reverse of the follow
shot, the ball being struck below the centre, and the cue passing
at least three inches beyond where the ball stood, as shown in the
diagram. This gives the cue
ball a retrograde motion, similar
to that imparted to a child’s
hoop by spinning it backward
while throwing it forward, so
as to make it return. If the object ball is reached before this retrograde
motion is exhausted, the effect will be to stop the forward
motion of the cue ball, and to give what is left of the retrograde
motion full play, making the cue ball return. The two great mistakes
made by beginners in playing draw shots are that they pull
the cue back, instead of driving it clear through the ball aimed at,
and that they strike so hard that the forward motion of the cue
ball is too strong for the retrograde motion to overcome it, or the
object ball to stop it. It is never necessary to strike harder than
sufficient to reach the object ball and get back to the carrom ball,
unless one is playing for position.</p>

<p>When the balls are so close together that to run the cue through
the ball would make a foul shot, the draw may still be made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span>
pointing the cue off to the side, and pushing it past the cue ball,
instead of through it. This will secure the retrograde motion, but
accompanied by a great deal of twist, which must be calculated
for if the cue ball is to strike a cushion. A short draw may also
be made by using the pinch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p623.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="Diagram of a massé shot" />
</div>

<p><i><b>The Massé.</b></i> Most players imagine this to be a very difficult
shot, but it is extremely simple if the principle of the direction of
the cue and the effect of the pinch are kept in view. If we place
the three balls in a straight line, about four inches apart, we have
the simplest form of the massé. To find the exact spot at which
the cue ball must be struck, join the centres of the cue and object
balls by an imaginary
line A-B.
At right angles
to this will be a
line A-E, and no
matter which side
of the ball B you
wish to massé
upon, your cue
must strike the
ball A somewhere
on the line
A-E. Suppose you wish to massé to the left, as shown in the diagram.
The pinch must be made on the ball about a quarter from
the top, the cue being pointed in the direction in which you want
the ball to go, which will be to the extreme edge of B, on the line
C-D. The cue must be held at an angle of about 70 degrees. A
firm but light blow with a well chalked cue will pinch your ball
toward E; but the direction of the cue will propel it toward D.
If the cue has been held at the right angle, and you have not
struck too hard, the ball will feel the effect of these two forces
equally, which will make it move toward a point half way between
D and E, which will be F. The retrograde motion being stronger
than the propulsion of the pinch, will gradually overcome it, and
the ball will return toward G. Contact with the ball B will cause
it to lose all but the forward motion, and it will roll easily toward
H, making the carrom.</p>

<p><i><b>The Side Stroke.</b></i> It is a popular delusion that the only way
to change the course of a ball is by giving it “twist,” “English,”
or “side.” Side has little or no influence on the cue ball until it
touches a cushion. Striking above or below the centre is all that
is necessary. If it is required to vary the angle at which the
object ball is to be struck, the distance below the centre will change
the angle of direction in the cue ball without any side stroke.
The art of accomplishing this is called <i><b>compensation</b></i>, an illustration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
of which is given in the diagram, A being the cue ball, and
B the object ball. This is a half
draw or force shot, the ball being
struck about half way between its
centre and the cloth. If we draw
imaginary lines connecting the centres
of A-B and B-C, and bisect
the angle, we get the point D,
which the cue ball must strike to
make the carrom. This will drive
the object ball in the direction D-E;
but if it is desirable that the object
ball should go more in the direction
G-F, so as to secure a better position for the next shot, the
cue ball will have to strike at G, which will make a draw shot,
bringing it back in the direction H, securing the position, but missing
the count. In this position the ignorant player puts on side,
but all that is necessary to compensate for this deviation in the
point of impact is to approach the point of the cue toward the
centre of the ball the exact distance that the point G is from the
point D. The higher the point of the cue is raised, the further the
ball will go from the line D-H. If struck much above the centre,
it will follow through the object ball, passing beyond the ball C
altogether.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p624.jpg" width="300" height="240" alt="Diagram of a side stroke" />
</div>

<p>When side is put upon a ball, it spins in that direction. If it is
struck on the left, and then goes to a cushion directly in front of
it, it will tend to fly off the cushion toward the left, making the
angle wider. If a ball spinning to the left goes to a cushion on
the left, it will tend to make the angle smaller, and the effect so
produced is called <i><b>reverse English</b></i>, which tends to slow the cue
ball.</p>

<h3>THE AMERICAN GAME.</h3>

<p>In the American game every carrom counts one point, and the
number of points that will constitute a game must be agreed upon
before play begins. The players string for the lead, the one bringing
his ball nearer the head cushion having the choice of balls and
of the first shot.</p>

<p>The great art in the American game is to keep the balls in front
of you, so as to leave yourself a comparatively easy shot. Every
time you get the cue ball between the two others you will find
yourself in difficulties; but whenever both the balls are in front of
the cue ball, there will be some chance to score. When there is a
choice of several ways of making a shot, the balls being wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
apart, it will usually be found that one of them will bring the
balls into better position than the others, and for that reason it is
called a <i><b>gathering shot</b></i>. The
expert tries to get the balls on the
rail by a series of these gathering
shots, and if any of the three
positions shown in the diagram
can be arrived at, a large run
may be made by the <i><b>rail nurse</b></i>.
When the balls are not left in one of these positions they are
said to <i><b>break</b></i>, but there are several
positions in which they may
be recovered by a kiss or a massé
shot. In No. 4, the player must be
careful to come back on the proper
side of the carrom ball, so as to get
back to position 2, if possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p625a.jpg" width="300" height="140" alt="Diagrams 1-3" />
<img src="images/p625b.jpg" width="300" height="140" alt="Diagrams 4-6" />
</div>

<p>When the player reaches the corner, there are three principal
positions for accomplishing the
turn. In the first shown, the spot
white must be touched very lightly
on the left side, the cue ball going
to the cushion with a strong English
on the right side. In the second
position, the red ball is barely
touched. The third position is a light force shot but would be a
half follow if the spot white were further out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p625c.jpg" width="300" height="140" alt="Diagram of the shots for dealing with corners" />
</div>

<h3>BAULK-LINE BILLIARDS.</h3>

<p>Professionals became so skilful in rail nursing that the baulk-line
was introduced to keep the balls away from the rail. This is a
chalk line, 10, 12, 14, or 18 inches from the cushions, according
to agreement, dividing the
table into eight baulk spaces,
as shown in the diagram.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p625d.jpg" width="300" height="160" alt="Diagram of the 8 baulk spaces" />
</div>

<p>It is foul if more than two
successive shots are made on
balls both of which are within
any one of the eight interdicted
spaces. Both balls
being within the space, the
striker can play on them once without sending either out; his next
stroke must send at least one out. Should it return, and both balls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
be again inside, he can play one shot, as before, without sending
either out. This process may be repeated <i>ad libitum</i>. Should
the second stroke fail to send a ball out it does not count, the
striker’s hand is out, and the next striker plays at the balls as he
finds them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p626.jpg" width="400" height="115" alt="Diagram of the turns in the baulk-line nurse described" />
</div>

<p>The great art in baulk-line nursing is to get the object and
carrom balls astride the line, and then to follow the principle of
the rail nurse. The <i><b>anchor</b></i> shot is now barred in championship
games. It consisted in getting two balls frozen to the cushion
astride of one end of a line, and then just rubbing their faces with
the cue ball. In the baulk-line nurse there are three principal
positions, and two turns, as shown in the diagram. In No. 3 the
red ball must be driven to the rail and back with great accuracy,
leaving the balls in position No. 1 again. The turns are very difficult.</p>

<h3>CUSHION CARROMS.</h3>

<p>This is a variety of the three-ball game in which a cushion must
be touched by the cue ball before the carrom is completed. The
cushion may be struck first, and the object ball afterward, or the
object ball first, and then the cushion. In the <i><b>Three-cushion
Carrom Game</b></i>, three cushions must be touched by the
cue ball before completing the count. In the <i><b>Bank-shot
Game</b></i>, the cue ball must strike at least one cushion before
touching the object ball.</p>

<p>The <i><b>Four-ball Game</b></i> is now obsolete. It was first played on
a table with corner pockets, and afterward on a carrom table, two
red balls being used, one spotted on the red and the other on the
white spot. Two carroms could be made on one shot.</p>

<p>The following are the most important <i><b>LAWS</b></i> of the carrom
game, and are copied by permission from the 1908 edition of the
“Laws of Billiards,” published by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender
Co.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span></p>

<h3>AMERICAN BILLIARD LAWS.</h3>

<p><i><b>1.</b></i> The game is begun by stringing for the lead; the player
who brings his ball nearest to the cushion at the head of the table
winning the choice of balls and the right to play first or to compel
his opponent to play. Should the striker fail to count, his opponent
makes the next play, aiming at will at either ball on the table.</p>

<p><i><b>2.</b></i> A carrom consists in hitting both object-balls with the cue-ball
in a fair and unobjectionable way; each carrom will count <i>one</i>
for the player. A penalty of <i>one</i> shall also be counted against the
player for every miss occurring during the game.</p>

<p><i><b>3.</b></i> A ball forced off the table is put back on its proper spot.
Should the player’s ball jump off the table after counting, the
count is good, the ball is spotted, and the player plays from the
spot.</p>

<p><i><b>4.</b></i> If in playing a shot the cue is not withdrawn from the cue-ball
before the cue-ball comes in contact with the object-ball, the
shot is foul, the player loses his count, and his hand is out.</p>

<p><i><b>5.</b></i> If the balls are disturbed accidentally through the medium
of any agency other than the player himself, they must be replaced
and the player allowed to proceed.</p>

<p><i><b>6.</b></i> If in the act of playing the player disturbs any ball other
than his own, he cannot make a counting stroke, but he may play
for safety. Should he disturb a ball after having played successfully,
he loses his count on that shot; his hand is out, and the ball
so disturbed is placed back as nearly as possible in the position
which it formerly occupied on the table, the other balls remaining
where they stop.</p>

<p><i><b>7.</b></i> Should a player touch his own ball with the cue or otherwise
previous to playing, it is foul, the player loses one, and cannot
play for safety. It sometimes happens that the player after
having touched his ball gives a second stroke, then the balls remain
where they stop, or are replaced as nearly as possible in their
former position at the option of his opponent.</p>

<p><i><b>8.</b></i> When the cue-ball is very near another, the player shall
not play without warning his adversary that they do not touch,
and giving him sufficient time to satisfy himself on that point.</p>

<p><i><b>9.</b></i> When the cue-ball is in contact with another, the balls
are spotted and the player plays with his ball in hand.</p>

<p><i><b>10.</b></i> Playing with the wrong ball is foul. However, should
the player using the wrong ball play more than one shot with it,
he shall be entitled to his score just the same as if he had played
with his own; as soon as his hand is out, the white balls must
change places, and the game proceed as usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">On Foul Strokes.</span>&mdash;It is a foul, and no count can be made:</p>

<p><i><b>1.</b></i> If a stroke is made except with the point of the cue.</p>

<p><i><b>2.</b></i> If the cue is not withdrawn from the cue-ball before the
latter comes in contact with an object-ball.</p>

<p><i><b>3.</b></i> If the striker, when in hand, plays from any position not
within the six-inch radius.</p>

<p><i><b>4.</b></i> If, in the act of striking, he has not at least one foot
<i>touching</i> the floor.</p>

<p><i><b>5.</b></i> If he strikes while a ball is in motion, unless it has come
to a rest, as provided in Sec. 10 on Foul Strokes.</p>

<p><i><b>6.</b></i> If he plays with the wrong ball, except as provided in foregoing
Law 10.</p>

<p><i><b>7.</b></i> If the player touches the cue-ball more than once in any
way, or hinders or accelerates it in any other way than by a legitimate
stroke of the cue; or if, during a stroke or after it, he in any
way touches, hinders, or accelerates an object-ball, except by the
one stroke of the cue-ball to which he is entitled.</p>

<p><i><b>8.</b></i> As touching any ball <i>in any way</i> is a stroke, a second
touch is a foul.</p>

<p><i><b>9.</b></i> It is a foul against the striker if any ball be disturbed,
hastened, or hindered by an opponent or any one but himself,
whether the ball or balls are at rest while he is aiming or striking,
in motion after he has struck, or at rest again after he has struck,
and pending his again taking aim.</p>

<p><i><b>10.</b></i> Should a ball that has once come to a standstill move
without apparent cause, while the player is preparing to strike, it
shall be replaced. Should it move before he can check his stroke,
it, and all other balls set in motion by that stroke, shall be replaced,
and the player shall repeat his shot, inasmuch as but for
the moving of the ball, he might have counted where he missed, or
missed where he counted.</p>

<p><i><b>11.</b></i> It is a foul if the striker plays directly at any ball with
which his own is in fixed contact, and the striker must in this instance
play from balls spotted, as in the opening stroke of the
game.</p>

<p><i><b>12.</b></i> It is a foul to place marks of any kind upon the cloth or
cushions as a guide to play; also foul to practise the banking shot
for the lead-off upon the plea of testing the balls.</p>

<p><i><b>13.</b></i> It is a foul against the non-striker, and the striker cannot
make a count on the ensuing shot, if a ball in play is lifted from
the table, except it be unavoidable in those cases in which it is
provided that, because of foul or irregular strokes, the balls shall
be transposed or replaced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>14.</b></i> In order to restrict deliberate playing for safety, it shall
be optional with the non-striker, if his opponent makes a miss in
each one of three successive innings, to accept the third miss or
to reject it and force his antagonist to hit at least one object-ball;
and for this purpose that antagonist’s ball shall be replaced by the
referee. Should two balls be hit by this stroke, there shall be no
count.</p>

<h3>FIFTEEN-BALL POOL.</h3>

<p>The most successful pool player is not the one who can make
difficult winning hazards with the greatest accuracy, but he who
thoroughly understands playing for position. If he is familiar with
the principles of the force, the follow, the draw, and the side
stroke, he should invariably be able to leave himself in a good
position for each succeeding shot; but unless he plans for position
in advance, he can never hope to be more than an average player.
To attain to proficiency in this there is no better training than
playing so many balls or “no count.”</p>

<p>There are some shots peculiar to winning hazards which should
be understood by every pool player, and they are illustrated in the
accompanying diagrams.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p629.jpg" width="400" height="70" alt="Diagram of the shots described" />
</div>

<p><i><b>No. 1</b></i> is the <i><b>stirabout</b></i>, and is a combination of the pinch and
push shots. It is used when the cue and object balls are both very
close to the pocket, but not in such a position as to allow the
player to “cut” the ball in. The cue is held perpendicularly,
and as low down on the ball as it will hold without slipping off.
The ball is then slowly rolled over with the point of the cue until
the cue begins to descend on the other side. The cue ball is then
pushed against the object ball, still with the point of the cue. <i><b>No.
2</b></i> will drive the spot white into the pocket if it is frozen to the red
ball. No. <i><b>3</b></i> is a very useful push shot when the balls are close
together. The cue is kept steadily on the cue ball until the object
ball has been pushed to one side. The moment the latter is at the
proper angle to run into the pocket the cue is applied sharply, and
then withdrawn. <i><b>No. 4</b></i> is a push shot used when the balls are
frozen to the cushion. The cue ball must be kept in contact with
the object ball until the latter has acquired sufficient momentum to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
reach the pocket. <i><b>No. 5</b></i> is a shot which was thought impossible
until a few years ago. It depends on the communication of side
to the object ball. The cue ball is struck very much on the side,
almost like a massé, the spin thus given being communicated to the
object ball and from that to the second ball, to which it must be
frozen. The result will be that the second ball will make a slight
curve on its way to the pocket.</p>

<p><i><b>False Angles.</b></i> In playing bank shots it is sometimes necessary
to make the object ball come back from the cushion at a
smaller angle than the natural one. Some players imagine this
can be done by putting side on the cue ball, but such is not the
case. It is accomplished by striking so hard that the ball buries
itself in the cushion, the result of which is that the angle of reflection
is less than that of incidence. It is possible to drive an
object ball to the rail at an angle of 60 degrees with such force that
after crossing the table twice it will come off at a perfect right
angle from the cushion. This is a very useful shot in banking for
the side pockets, and also in playing for the 1 or 4 pin at Pin Pool.</p>

<p>The following <i><b>LAWS</b></i> for Fifteen-Ball Pool are copied, by
permission, from the 1908 edition of the rules published by the
Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co.</p>

<p><i><b>1.</b></i> The game of Fifteen-Ball Pool is played with fifteen balls
numbered from one to fifteen, respectively, and one white ball not
numbered. The latter is the cue-ball, and at the opening of the
game, the player plays with it from within the string at the head
of the table, at any of the numbered balls, and afterward as he
finds it on the table, his object being to pocket as many of the
numbered balls as he can, the number on each ball he pockets
being scored to his credit; so that not he who pockets the largest
number of balls, but he whose score, when added up, yields the
largest total, wins the game. Before commencing the game these
fifteen balls are placed in the form of a triangle upon the table&mdash;a
triangular frame being employed for this purpose to insure correctness.
The ball numbered fifteen is so placed upon the table
as to form the apex of the triangle, pointing upward toward the
head of the table, and in forming the triangle the fifteen-ball
should rest as nearly as possible upon the spot known as the deep-red
spot in the Three-Ball Game. The other balls should have
their places in the triangle so that the highest numbers shall be
nearest the apex, the lowest numbers forming the base.</p>

<p><i><b>2.</b></i> The player who makes the opening stroke must play from
within the string from the head of the table and must strike the
pyramid of object-balls with such force as to make at least two of
the object-balls strike a cushion, or at least one object-ball go
into a pocket. Should he fail to do either he forfeits three points
and the next player plays. All balls pocketed on the opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span>
stroke count for the player, and it is not necessary for him to call
the numbers of the balls he intends pocketing before making the
opening stroke.</p>

<p><i><b>3.</b></i> Before making any other stroke except the opening stroke
the player must <i>distinctly</i> call the number of the ball he intends
to pocket, but he need not designate the particular pocket into
which he intends to put it. Unless he calls the ball pocketed it
does not count for him, and must be placed on the deep-red spot,
or if that be occupied, as nearly below it as possible. The player
loses his hand but does not forfeit any points, and the next player
plays. Should he call more than one ball he must pocket all the
balls he calls, otherwise none of them can be counted for him.</p>

<p><i><b>4.</b></i> After the opening stroke each player must either pocket a
ball, make an <i>object</i>-ball strike a cushion, or the cue-ball strike a
cushion after contact with an object-ball, under penalty of forfeiture
of three points. Three forfeitures in succession loses the
game for the player making them.</p>

<p><i><b>5.</b></i> Should the player pocket, by the same stroke, more balls
than he calls, he is entitled to the balls he pockets, provided he
pockets the called ball.</p>

<p><i><b>6.</b></i> A forfeiture of three points is deducted from the player’s
score for making a miss; pocketing his own ball; forcing his own
ball off the table; failing to make the opening stroke, as provided
in Rule 2; failing either to make an object-ball strike a cushion
or go into a pocket, as provided in Rule 4; striking his own ball
twice; playing out of his turn, if detected doing so before he has
made more than one counting stroke.</p>

<p><i><b>7.</b></i> A ball whose centre is on the string line must be regarded
as within the line.</p>

<p><i><b>8.</b></i> If the player pocket one or more of the object-balls, and
his own ball goes into a pocket, or off the table from the stroke, he
cannot score for the numbered balls, which must be placed on the
spot known as the deep-red spot, or if it be occupied as nearly
below it as possible on a line with that spot.</p>

<h3>AMERICAN PYRAMID POOL.</h3>

<p>The fifteen balls are numbered from one to fifteen respectively,
and are usually colored red, but the numbers on the balls are
used simply for convenience in calling the number of each ball
which the player intends to pocket and do not in any way affect
the score of the player, which is determined by the number of
balls pocketed. Scratches pay one ball, which must be placed on
the deep red spot.</p>

<h3>CONTINUOUS POOL.</h3>

<p>In Continuous Pool, the scoring of the game is continued until
all the balls in each frame have been pocketed, and the game may
consist of any number of balls or points up which may be agreed
upon. Each ball pocketed scores one point for the striker and
the game is usually scored upon the string of buttons over the
table, as in regular billiards. Penalties are paid through deducting
points from the offending player’s score or string of buttons, instead
of forfeiting a ball to the table as in regular pyramid pool.
The numbers on the balls are simply used for convenience in calling
the number of each ball which the player intends to pocket,
and do not in any way affect the score of the player.</p>

<h3>ENGLISH PYRAMID POOL.</h3>

<p>This differs from the American game in several points. There
are no “call shots,” the player being entitled to every ball he
pockets, whether he played for it or not. All balls in hand must
be played from a D, 21 to 23 inches in diameter. There is no rule
about driving two balls to the cushion on the opening shot.
When all the red balls but one are pocketed, the red and white
balls are used as cue balls alternately. If there are only two
players, and only two balls on the table, the red and white, if
either player makes a miss or goes in the pocket himself, that ends
the game; but if there are more than two players another red ball
is spotted, as in the American game. The baulk line is no protection,
a player in hand being allowed to play on any ball on the
table, even if it is behind the D.</p>

<h3>SHELL OUT.</h3>

<p>This game should not be confounded with Black Pool. It is
simply English Pyramids, but instead of making the player with
the lowest score at the end pay for the table, each player equally
shares the expense, and the balls are pocketed for so much apiece.
If the amount of the shell-out was a shilling, and there were six
players, any person pocketing a ball would receive a shilling from
each of the others, and would play again. A losing hazard or a
miss would compel the striker to pay a shilling to each of the
others, instead of putting a ball back on the table. The last ball
pays double.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span></p>

<h3>HIGH-LOW-JACK-GAME.</h3>

<p>This game is played with a set of balls the same as used in
Fifteen-Ball Pool.</p>

<p>Any number of persons may play, the order of play being determined
by the rolling of the small numbered balls.</p>

<p>The fifteen-ball is High; the one-ball is Low; the nine-ball is
Jack; and the highest aggregate is Game. Seven points generally
constitute a game.</p>

<p>In cases where players have one and two to go to finish game,
the first balls holed count out first, be they High, Low, or Jack.</p>

<p>In setting up the pyramid the three counting balls&mdash;High, Low,
Jack&mdash;are placed in the centre, with High at the head of the three
named balls, the other balls as in regular Fifteen-Ball Pool.</p>

<p>When players have each one to go, instead of setting up an
entire frame of pyramids, a ball is placed at the foot of the table,
in direct line with the spots, and at a distance from the lower
cushion equal to the diameter of another of the pool balls. This
ball must be pocketed by banking it to one or more cushions.
The player who pockets the ball wins the game.</p>

<h3>FORTY-ONE POOL.</h3>

<p>Forty-One Pool is played with a regular Fifteen-Ball Pool set
of balls, the object of play being to pocket a sufficient number of
the pool balls which added to the private small ball shall score
exactly 41.</p>

<h3>CHICAGO POOL.</h3>

<p>This game is played with the numbered pool balls from 1 to 15
and a white cue-ball, as in Fifteen-Ball Pool, the object being to
play upon and pocket the balls in their numerical order.</p>

<p>The table is laid out for the game by placing the one ball
against the end cushion at the first right-hand diamond sight at
the foot of the table, the two-ball is placed at the centre diamond
sight on same cushion; the remaining thirteen balls are placed in
the order of their numbers at the succeeding diamond sights.
The three sights on the end rail at head of the table are not
occupied by any ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span></p>

<p>The opening stroke <i>must</i> be to strike the <i>one</i>-ball. If that ball
is holed it is placed to the credit of the player, and he continues
his hand until he fails to score, but in continuing he must play
each time upon the ball bearing the lowest number on the table.
After playing upon that ball, however, should any other be
pocketed by the same stroke, irrespective of its number, it shall
be placed to the player’s credit so pocketing it.</p>

<p>If the line of aim at the ball required to be hit is covered by
another ball, the player may resort to a bank play or massé, etc.,
but should he fail to hit the required ball he forfeits three, receiving
a scratch.</p>

<h3>COW-BOY POOL.</h3>

<p>1. The game is played by two or more contestants, on a pool
table, with one cue ball and three colored balls numbered respectively
1, 3 and 5.</p>

<p>2. At the commencement of the game the ball numbered 1 shall
be placed on the spot at the head of the table, the ball numbered
5 shall be placed on the centre spot, and the ball numbered 3 shall
be placed on the lower spot, and whenever any object ball is
pocketed or forced off the table it shall be replaced on the original
spot, except as provided for in Rule No. 12.</p>

<p>3. The opening player may play from any point within the string
line he may choose, but must play upon the No. 3 ball before striking
any other, or forfeit his hand.</p>

<p>4. The winner is the player who first accomplishes the main
object of the game, which is to score 101 points by the “Cow-Boy
method,” which is that the first 90 points may be scored by either
carroms or the pocketing of one or more of the numbered balls,
which shall count that number for the player; the scoring of a
single carrom shall count 1, and a double 2.</p>

<p>5. On arriving at the exact number of 90 points, the contestant
must next obtain 10 more points by carroms only; and having
arrived at the score of 100, the last point must be obtained by
playing the cue ball onto the No. 1 ball and thence into any pocket
he may designate, without touching either of the other balls, however,
and should the cue ball enter any other pocket, the hand is
out and the run, if any, lost.</p>

<p>6. Any point made by a player and scored for him by either the
marker or himself at the completion of any hand can never be lost;
but should a player at any time make a scratch, miss or foul, any
points previously made by him in that hand shall be lost and the
hand shall pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">[635]</a></span></p>

<p>7. At the completion of the first 90 points all the balls must
come to rest on the table before the player makes his next stroke;
otherwise the following stroke shall be a foul.</p>

<p>8. At the completion of 100 points the balls must all come to
rest before the player makes his next stroke; otherwise the stroke
is foul.</p>

<p>9. Should a player pocket the cue ball twice in succession
without striking any object bail, he shall forfeit the game.</p>

<p>10. Should a player while upon his carroms pocket any ball, the
hand is out, and he loses any points he may have made on that
run.</p>

<p>11. Whenever, except on the final stroke, the cue ball is
pocketed or forced off the table, the hand is out, the points scored
on that run are lost, and the cue ball is in hand for the following
player, who must play on a ball outside the string line, or else on
some point of the cushion outside the line.</p>

<p>12. Should the spot on which any pocketed ball belongs be
occupied, said ball shall be left off the table until the spot is free
and the balls are at rest, with this exception&mdash;that should the 1
ball be pocketed, and its spot occupied, any player who is exactly
100, and whose turn it is to play, may demand that all the object
balls be spotted and he shall play with ball in hand.</p>

<p>13. It is a foul if the player touch any ball with his person or
clothing. It is a foul if he strike the cue ball twice or with anything
but the point of the cue. It is a miss if he shoot without
causing the cue ball to strike any object ball. It is a scratch if he
cause the cue ball to enter a pocket except on the 101st point, or
leave the table.</p>

<p>14. Carroms obtained by pushing during the first 90 points are
legitimate, but not during the following ten points; and the 101st
shot must be a clean stroke, and a push shot will not be allowed.</p>

<p>15. When a player is 100, should he fail to strike the 1 ball his
hand is out and his run, if any, forfeited.</p>

<p>16. During the first 90 points, should the cue ball be frozen to
an object ball, and if by a push causes the object ball to move,
any resulting carrom shall be valid. If, however, the frozen object
ball fails to move, it shall be considered as not having been touched
except that should the cue ball strike a cushion, it shall not be a
scratch.</p>

<p>17. Any cases not covered by these rules shall be governed
as far as possible by the accepted rules of pool and four-ball
billiards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span></p>

<h3>SNOOKER POOL.</h3>

<p>1. The game of Snooker’s Pool is played by two or more
players, either all against all or in partnership, with fifteen red
balls, six pool balls, and one white ball as hereafter described.
Any rest may be used.</p>

<p>2. To decide the order of play, as many pool balls as there are
players or sides shall be put into a basket, shaken, and given out
to the players by the marker.</p>

<p>The players play in the order in which the colors appear on the
pool marking board. A player pocketing a ball scores its value
as against each of the other players, and when penalized, pays the
penalty to each of them. In a game where sides are formed a
player either scores for his own side, or is penalized to the opposing
side or sides.</p>

<p>3. When commencing a game the fifteen red balls shall be
placed as in the game of Pyramids. For each of these balls
pocketed, according to rule, the striker shall score one point.
The pool balls to be used are the yellow, green, brown, blue, pink,
and black, which shall be spotted as follows at the commencement
of the game, and have the appended values when pocketed according
to rule:</p>

<ul>

<li>The Yellow ball shall be placed on the right hand spot of
the baulk line and count two points;</li>

<li>The Green ball shall be placed on the left hand spot of the
baulk line and count three points;</li>

<li>The Brown ball shall be placed on the middle spot of the
baulk line and count four points;</li>

<li>The Blue ball shall be placed on the spot between the two
middle pockets and count five points;</li>

<li>The Pink ball shall be placed at the apex of the pyramid
and count six points;</li>

<li>The Black ball shall be placed on the billiard spot and
count seven points.</li>

<li>The White ball shall be used in rotation by the various
players taking part in the game solely as the striker’s
ball, and shall be played from the “D” at the start of a
game by the first player, and at any other period of the
game, after it has been off the table from any cause
whatever.</li>

</ul>

<p>4. The ball shall be struck with the point of the cue and not
“pushed.” If, after the striker’s ball has been forced against an
object ball, the point of his cue remain or come in contact with
his ball, the stroke is foul. There is no difference between the
act of striking and the act of aiming.</p>

<p>5. The “baulk” is no protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span></p>

<p>6. The striker must pocket a red ball before playing upon a pool
ball; otherwise the stroke is foul, and after pocketing a red ball
he must play upon a pool ball, an order of play that must be
observed throughout each break so long as a red ball remains
upon the table.</p>

<p>7. After pocketing a red ball the striker is at liberty to select
the pool ball upon which he will play, but when there is no longer
a red ball on the table, the pool balls must be played at and taken
in their order of value from lowest to highest, save that the player
pocketing the last red ball shall be allowed to select the first pool
ball upon which he plays, which, if pocketed, shall be respotted
and the pool balls played at in their order of value.</p>

<p>8. When playing on a pool ball the striker, if asked the question
by a player taking part in the game, shall “declare” the ball
selected.</p>

<p>9. Any number of red balls may be taken in one stroke; but,
if a pool ball is taken in conjunction with a red ball, the stroke is
foul. After pocketing a red ball only the pool ball aimed at may
be taken.</p>

<p>10. A red ball once off the table shall not be brought into play
again under any circumstances; but all pool balls pocketed shall
be respotted in their original positions (save that the pink ball
shall be placed on the pyramid spot), until Rule 7, as to playing
upon the pool balls in rotation, comes into force. When the pool
balls are being played upon in rotation, they shall not be respotted
after being pocketed in proper order and according to rule.</p>

<p>11. No ball shall, under any circumstances, be taken up.</p>

<p>12. Should the spot allotted to any pool ball be occupied when
it becomes necessary to respot it, it shall be placed upon the
<i>nearest unoccupied spot</i>, and, failing that, as near as possible to
its proper spot in the direction of the centre spot. If the middle
spot of the baulk line is occupied, the brown ball after being
pocketed shall, if possible, be placed on the left-hand spot of the
baulk line, and, failing that, the rule as above applies.</p>

<p>13. If the striker’s ball is touching another, such ball not being
playable, and he disturb the ball touching his own, the stroke is
foul.</p>

<p>14. Should the striker’s ball be so placed that he cannot play
direct on the object ball, he is said to be “snookered.”</p>

<h3>FOUL STROKES AND PENALTIES.</h3>

<p>15. Foul strokes are made or penalties incurred by (1) “Pushing”
instead of striking the ball, or striking the ball more than
once; (2) Playing out of turn; (3) Playing with both feet off
the floor; (4) Playing before all the balls have become stationary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
when off the table, or wrongly spotted; (5) Playing with the
wrong ball; (6) Touching or moving any ball, except in the legitimate
manner set forth in these rules; (7) Forcing any ball off the
table; (8) Wilfully interfering with an opponent, or the run of the
balls, and refusing to obey the referee’s decision; (9) Missing, running
a coup, striking the wrong ball, or pocketing the white ball;
(10) Playing at or pocketing any ball except in the proper rotation;
(11) Striking two balls, other than two red balls, simultaneously;
(12) Giving an intentional miss; (13) Pocketing more than
one ball&mdash;other than red balls&mdash;by one stroke.</p>

<p>16. If the striker “push” his ball or strike it more than once, he
cannot score, but is subject to any other penalty that he may incur
by the stroke.</p>

<p>17. If a player play out of turn, he shall forfeit his next turn,
otherwise the sequence of turns shall not be altered. If the error
be discovered during his break, he cannot score from the last stroke
made, and the balls shall be replaced by the marker as nearly as
possible in the positions they occupied before the stroke objected
to. The striker shall be credited with any previous scores, but is
subject to any other penalty he may incur.</p>

<p>18. The striker cannot score by a stroke made with both feet off
the floor, but is subject to any penalty he may otherwise incur.</p>

<p>19. If the striker play before all the balls have ceased rolling, or
before a pool ball has been respotted, or whilst any pool ball has
been wrongly spotted, he cannot score, and the next player in rotation
shall proceed from the position in which the balls have been
left. The striker is subject to any penalty he may otherwise incur.</p>

<p>20. If the striker play with the wrong ball, he shall be penalized
in the value of the black ball.</p>

<p>21. If the striker touch a ball in play otherwise than in the
proper manner laid down in these Rules, he cannot score and the
balls shall be replaced. After the balls are replaced the stroke
must be played, if the striker was still in play when the ball was
moved or touched, and he is subject to any other penalty he may
incur. Should he touch a ball after the completion of any stroke,
<i>i.e.</i>, when the balls have become stationary, his scores from previous
strokes shall hold good.</p>

<p>22. If the striker force any of the red or pool balls off the table,
he shall be penalized in the value of the ball or balls so forced off.
Should the ball or balls forced off the table be struck out of order,
or of inferior value to the ball that should have been struck, the
latter ball shall govern the penalty. Should he force his own ball
off the table, he shall be penalized in the value of the ball aimed
at, unless another ball of higher value be first struck, in which case
such higher ball shall govern the penalty.</p>

<p>23. If a player refuse to continue the game when called upon to
do so, or intentionally obstruct an opponent, or wilfully interfere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
with the running of the balls, he shall be penalized in the total value
of all the balls remaining in play.</p>

<p>24. If the striker miss the object ball, or run a coup, or pocket
the white ball, he shall be penalized in the value of the ball aimed
at; but, if he strike another ball or balls, he shall be penalized in
the value of the first ball so struck, unless the ball so struck is of
lower value than the ball aimed at and missed, in which case the
penalty is governed by the value of the ball aimed at. Should the
striker in pocketing any ball hole the white, he cannot score, and is
penalized in the value of the ball pocketed. Should the striker
(excepting as provided in <i>Rule</i> 9) pocket a ball other than the one
aimed at, he cannot score, and is penalized in the value of such ball
unless the ball pocketed is of lower value than the ball aimed at,
in which case the penalty is governed by the value of the ball
aimed at.</p>

<p>25. If the striker play at or pocket a ball except in the proper
rotation, he shall be penalized in the value of the ball so played at
or pocketed unless the ball so played at be of lower value than the
ball which should have been selected, in which case the penalty is
governed by the latter ball.</p>

<p>26. If the striker strike simultaneously a pool ball and a red
ball, or two pool balls, he shall be penalized in the value of the
higher ball.</p>

<p>27. If the striker pocket the white ball after contact with another,
he shall be penalized in the value of the ball struck, unless
the object ball so struck be out of order, in which case the penalty
shall be governed by the ball of the higher value.</p>

<p>28. Should the striker give an intentional miss, he shall be penalized
in the value of the black ball, and be compelled to play the
stroke again. No score can accrue from such stroke, but the
striker shall be subject to any further penalty he may incur.</p>

<p>29. If the striker pocket more than one ball, other than red balls,
in one stroke, he cannot score, and is penalized in the value of the
highest ball pocketed.</p>

<p>30. In the absence of a referee the marker of the room shall
decide all disputes that may arise; and, if he does not know of the
matter in dispute, the majority of the onlookers shall decide.</p>

<h3>ENGLISH POOL.</h3>

<p>This game is known in England as Colom-Ball, or Following
Pool. The balls are placed in a pool bottle, and shaken up by
the marker, who then gives one to each candidate for play in
rotation. The player who receives the white ball places it on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>
spot, and the one who gets the red ball plays from within the D
at the head of the table. The marker calls the colour of the
player whose turn it is, and notifies him which ball will play on
him, so that he may play for safety if he can. The following are
Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co.’s rules:</p>

<p><i><b>1.</b></i> When coloured balls are used, the players must play progressively,
as the colours are placed on the pool marking-board,
the top colour being No. 1.</p>

<p><i><b>2.</b></i> Each player has <i>three</i> lives at starting. No. 1 places his
ball on the “winning and losing” spot, No. 2 plays at No. 1, No.

be in or out of baulk.</p>

<p><i><b>4.</b></i> When any doubt arises as to the nearest ball, the marker

<p><i><b>6.</b></i> The player loses a life by pocketing his own ball off another,

<p><i><b>13.</b></i> If a ball or balls are in the way of a striker’s cue, so that
he cannot play at his ball, he can have them taken up.</p>

<p><i><b>14.</b></i> When the striker <i>takes</i> a life, he continues to play on as
long as he can pocket a ball, or until the balls are all off the
table, in which latter case he places his own ball on the spot as at
the commencement.</p>

<p><i><b>15.</b></i> The first player who loses his three lives is entitled to purchase,
or <i>star</i>, by paying into the pool a sum equal to his original
stake, for which he receives lives equal in number to the lowest
number of lives on the board.</p>

<p><i><b>16.</b></i> If the player first out refuse to star, the second player out
may do so; but if the second refuse, the third may star, and so
on, until only two players are left in the pool, when the privilege
of starring ceases.</p>

<p><i><b>17.</b></i> Only one star is allowed in a pool.</p>

<p><i><b>18.</b></i> If the striker move his own or any other ball <i>while in
the act of striking</i>, the stroke is foul; and if, by the same
stroke, he pocket a ball or force it off the table, the owner of that
ball does not lose a life, and the ball so pocketed must be placed
on its original spot. But if by that foul stroke the player pocket
his own ball or force it off the table, <i>he</i> loses a life.</p>

<p><i><b>19.</b></i> If the striker’s ball touch the one he has to play at, he is
at liberty either to play at it or at any other ball on the table, and
such stroke is not to be considered foul; in such a case, however,
the striker loses a life by running his ball into a pocket or forcing
it over the table.</p>

<p><i><b>20.</b></i> If, after making a hazard, the striker takes up his ball, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span>
stops it before it has done running, he cannot claim the life for the
ball pocketed.</p>

<p><i><b>21.</b></i> If, before a star, two or more balls, each having one life,
are pocketed by the same stroke, the owner of the first ball struck
can star; but if he refuse, the other player whose ball was
pocketed may star.</p>

<p><i><b>22.</b></i> Should the striker’s ball stop on the place from which a ball
has been taken up, the ball which has been removed must remain
in hand until the spot is unoccupied, when it is to be replaced.</p>

<p><i><b>23.</b></i> Should the striker’s ball miss the ball played at, no person
except the striker is allowed to stop the ball till it has ceased running
or struck another ball.</p>

<p><i><b>24.</b></i> Should the striker have his next player’s ball removed,
and his own ball stop on the spot it occupied, the next player
must give a miss from baulk, for which miss he does not lose a life.</p>

<p><i><b>25.</b></i> When a ball has been taken up, and any other than the
next player’s ball stop on the spot it occupied, the ball so taken up
must remain in hand till it can be replaced. But if it be the turn
of the ball in hand to play before the one occupying its proper
place, the latter must be taken up till there be room to replace it.</p>

<p><i><b>26.</b></i> If the corner of the cushion should prevent the striker
from playing in a direct line, he can have any ball removed for the
purpose of playing at the object-ball from a cushion.</p>

<p><i><b>27.</b></i> When three players, each with one life, remain in a pool,
and the striker make a miss, the other two divide without a stroke.</p>

<p><i><b>28.</b></i> Neither of the last two players can star, but if they are
left with an equal number of lives each they may divide the
pool; the striker, however, is entitled to his stroke before the
division.</p>

<p><i><b>29.</b></i> All disputes are to be decided by the marker; but if he be
interested in the game, they shall then be settled by a majority of
the players.</p>

<h3>BLACK POOL.</h3>

<p>This is a variation of English Colour-Ball Pool. A black ball is
placed on the centre spot. The colours follow one another just as
in English pool, until all the balls have come upon the table.
After that, any ball on the table may be played at, and if it is
pocketed, the player has the option of playing at the black ball.
If he pockets it, each player pays him the amount of a life, so that
the player whose ball was first pocketed would have to pay two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span>,
one for his own ball and one for the black. If a ball is pocketed
before the balls are all on the table, the player may play on the
black; but the following players must play on their colours until
the first round is complete. No one is ever dead, and the game
may be continued indefinitely, although half an hour is the usual
limit. The players share the expense of the table, as at Shell-out.</p>

<h3>ENGLISH BILLIARDS.</h3>

<p>This game is played with three balls, one red and two white.
Every winning hazard off the red counts 3; hazards off the white
count 2, and all carroms count 2. If a player makes a carrom and
a losing hazard on the same stroke, it counts 5 if the red was the
object ball; 4 if the white was the object ball. A player may
make 10 on one stroke by playing on the red, making a carrom,
and pocketing all three balls. A miss counts one for the adversary;
but if the player who makes a miss runs into a pocket or
jumps off the table, his adversary counts 3.</p>

<p>The secret of success in the English game is not in gathering
shots or rail nursing, but in repeated position; that is, playing shots
so that the object ball returns to its position, the cue ball falling into
a pocket and being played again from an advantageous position in
the D. If the red ball is left in a good position for a losing hazard
in either of the side pockets, the player should place his own ball
in such a position in the D that he can drive the red to the bottom
cushion and back again, leaving himself another easy hazard in the
side pockets.</p>

<p>If the red is near a bottom pocket, and the player’s ball is in
hands, the beginner will invariably leave the red ball in baulk, even
if he makes the hazard. The reason is that he strikes with just
force enough to reach the red and go into the pocket, and this
force is just enough to drive the red about the same distance in
the opposite direction, leaving it where the cue ball came from&mdash;in
baulk.</p>

<p>The English do not understand gathering shots, nursing, and
cushion carroms so well as the Americans, and play chiefly for the
winning and losing hazards. The objective point of the expert is
the <i><b>spot stroke</b></i>, which consists in getting exactly behind the red
ball when it is on its spot, and then driving it into the corner
pocket, returning the cue ball to its position with a light draw
shot. If the cue ball fails to come back exactly behind the red the
position may be recovered in several ways, some of which are
shown in the diagrams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p644.jpg" width="400" height="175" alt="Diagram of the shots described" />
</div>

<p>No. 1 is the perfect position for the spot stroke; the dotted
lines in the others show the course that must be followed by the
cue ball to recover the initial position.</p>

<p><i><b>Man-of-war Game</b></i> is a variety of English billiards in which
there are three white balls, each belonging to different players.</p>

<p>The following <i><b>LAWS</b></i> are taken, by permission, from the rules
published by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co.</p>

<h4>ENGLISH BILLIARD LAWS.</h4>

<p><i><b>1.</b></i> The choice of balls and order of play shall, unless mutually
agreed upon by the two players, be determined by stringing; and
the striker whose ball stops nearest the lower [or bottom] cushion,
after being forced from baulk up the table, may take which ball he
likes, and play, or direct his opponent to play first, as he may deem
expedient.</p>

<p><i><b>2.</b></i> The red ball shall, at the opening of every game, be placed
on the top [or red] spot, and replaced after being pocketed or
forced off the table, or whenever the balls are broken.</p>

<p><i><b>3.</b></i> Whoever breaks the balls, i. <i>e</i>., opens the game, must
play out of baulk, though it is not necessary that he shall strike the
red ball.</p>

<p><i><b>4.</b></i> The game shall be adjudged in favour of whoever first
scores the number of points agreed on, when the marker shall call
“game”; or it shall be given against whoever, after having once
commenced, shall neglect or refuse to continue when called upon
by his opponent to play.</p>

<p><i><b>5.</b></i> If the striker scores by his stroke he continues until he
ceases to make any points, when his opponent follows on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>6.</b></i> If when moving the cue backward and forward, and prior
to a stroke, it touches and moves the ball, the ball must be replaced
to the satisfaction of an adversary, otherwise it is a foul stroke;
but if the player strikes, and grazes any part of the ball with any
part of the cue, it must be considered a stroke, and the opponent
follows on.</p>

<p><i><b>7.</b></i> If a ball rebounds from the table, and is prevented in any
way, or by any object except the cushion, from falling to the
ground, or if it lodges on a cushion and remains there, it shall be
considered off the table, unless it is the red, which must be
spotted.</p>

<p><i><b>8.</b></i> A ball on the brink of the pocket need not be “challenged”:
if it ceases running and remains stationary, then falls in,
it must be replaced, and the score thus made does not count.</p>

<p><i><b>9.</b></i> Any ball or balls behind the baulk-line, or resting exactly
upon the line, are not playable if the striker be in hand, and he
must play out of baulk before hitting another ball.</p>

<p><i><b>10.</b></i> Misses may be given with the point or butt of the cue,
and shall count one for each against the player; or if the player
strike his ball with the cue more than once a penalty shall be enforced,
and the non-striker may oblige him to play again, or may
call on the marker to place the ball at the point it reached or
would have reached when struck first. [The butt may also be
used for playing a ball in hand up the table in order to strike a
ball in baulk.]</p>

<p><i><b>11.</b></i> Foul strokes do not score to the player, who must allow
his opponent to follow on. They are made thus: By striking a
ball twice with the cue; by touching with the hand, ball, or cue an
opponent’s or the red ball; by playing with the wrong ball; by
lifting both feet from the floor when playing; by playing at the
striker’s own ball and displacing it ever so little (except while taking
aim, when it shall be replaced, and he shall play again).</p>

<p><i><b>12.</b></i> The penalty for a foul stroke is losing the lead, and, in
case of a score, an opponent must have the red ball spotted, and
himself break the balls, when the player who made the foul must
follow suit, both playing from the D. If the foul is not claimed the
player continues to score, if he can.</p>

<p><i><b>13.</b></i> After being pocketed or forced off the table the red ball
must be spotted on the top spot, but if that is occupied by another
ball the red must be placed on the centre spot between the middle
pockets.</p>

<p><i><b>14.</b></i> If in taking aim the player moves his ball and causes it to
strike another, even without intending to make a stroke, a foul
stroke may be claimed by an adversary. (See Rule Fifteenth.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>15.</b></i> If a player fail to hit another ball, it counts one to his opponent;
but if by the same stroke the player’s ball is forced over
the table or into any pocket it counts three to his opponent.</p>

<p><i><b>16.</b></i> Forcing any ball off the table, either before or after the
score, causes the striker to gain nothing by the stroke.</p>

<p><i><b>17.</b></i> In the event of either player using his opponent’s ball and
scoring, the red must be spotted and the balls broken again by the
non-striker; but if no score is made, the next player may take his
choice of balls and continue to use the ball he so chooses to the
end of the game. No penalty, however, attaches in either case unless
the mistake be discovered before the next stroke.</p>

<p><i><b>18.</b></i> No person except an opponent has a right to tell the
player that he is using the wrong ball, or to inform the non-striker
that his opponent has used the wrong ball; and if the opponent
does not see the striker use the ball, or, seeing him, does not claim
the penalty, the marker is bound to score to the striker any points
made.</p>

<p><i><b>19.</b></i> Should the striker [whose ball is in hand], in playing up
the table on a ball or balls in baulk, either by accident or design,
strike one of them [with his own ball] without first going out of
baulk, his opponent may have the balls replaced, score a miss, and
follow on; or may cause the striker to play again, or may claim a
foul, and have the red spotted and the balls broken again.</p>

<p><i><b>20.</b></i> The striker, when in hand, may not play at a cushion
within the baulk (except by going first up the table) so as to hit
balls that are within or without the line.</p>

<p><i><b>21.</b></i> If in hand, and in the act of playing, the striker shall move
his ball with insufficient strength to take it out of baulk, it shall be
counted as a miss to the opponent, who, however, may oblige him
to replace his ball and play again. [Failing to play out of baulk,
the player may be compelled to play his stroke over again.]</p>

<p><i><b>22.</b></i> If in playing a pushing stroke the striker pushes more
than once it is unfair, and any score he may make does not count.
His opponent follows by breaking the balls.</p>

<p><i><b>23.</b></i> If in the act of drawing back his cue the striker knocks
the ball into a pocket, it counts three to the opponent, and is
reckoned a stroke.</p>

<p><i><b>24.</b></i> If a foul stroke be made while giving a miss, the adversary
may enforce the penalty or claim the miss, but he cannot do
both.</p>

<p><i><b>25.</b></i> If either player take up a ball, unless by consent, the
adversary may have it replaced, or may have the balls broken; but
if any other person touches or takes up a ball it must be replaced
by the marker as nearly as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>26.</b></i> If, after striking, the player or his opponent should by any
means obstruct or hasten the speed of any ball, it is at the opponent
or player’s option to have them replaced, or to break the
balls.</p>

<p><i><b>27.</b></i> No player is allowed to receive, nor any bystander to offer
advice on the game; but should any person be appealed to by the
marker or either player he has a right to offer an opinion; or if a
spectator sees the game wrongly marked he may call out, but he
must do so prior to another stroke.</p>

<p><i><b>28.</b></i> The marker shall act as umpire, but any question may be
referred by either player to the company, the opinion of the majority
of whom shall be acted upon.</p>

<h3>PIN POOL.</h3>

<p>The game of Pin Pool is played with two white balls and one
red, together with five small wooden pins, which are set up in the
middle of the table, diamond fashion, each pin having a value to
accord with the position it occupies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p647.jpg" width="150" height="110" alt="Diagram of the layout of the pins" />
</div>

<p>The pin nearest the string line is No. 1; that to the right of it is
No. 2; to the left, No. 3; the pin farthest from the string line is
No. 4; and the central or black pin, No. 5. These numbers may
be chalked on the cloth in front of each particular pin.</p>

<p>Neither carroms nor hazards count; for pocketing a ball (when
playing on a pocket table), or causing it to jump off the table or
lodge on the cushion, or for missing altogether, nothing is forfeited
other than the stroke. The only penalty is that the ball so
offending shall be spotted upon the white-ball spot at the foot of
the table, or if that be occupied then on the nearest spot thereto
unoccupied.</p>

<p>When the pins are arranged, the rotation of the players is determined
in like manner as in Fifteen-Ball Pool, after which each
player receives from the marker a little numbered ball which is
placed in the player’s cup on the pool board, and the number of
which is not known to any of his opponents.</p>

<p>The object of the player is to knock down as many pins as will
count exactly thirty-one when the number on the small ball held
by him is added to their aggregate; thus, if the small ball is No. 9,
the player will have to gain twenty-two points on the pins before
calling game, and whoever first gets exactly thirty-one points in
this manner wins the pool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span></p>

<p>A white ball is spotted five inches from the lower end of the
table, on a line drawn down the centre; and the red ball placed
upon its own spot at the foot of the table.</p>

<p>Player No. 1 must play with the remaining white ball from any
point within the string-line at the head of the table at either the
red or white ball, or place his own on the string spot. Player No.
2 may play with any ball on the table&mdash;red or white. After the
first stroke has been played, the players, in their order, may play
with or at any ball upon the board.</p>

<p>Unless the player has played on some ball upon the board before
knocking down a pin, the stroke under all circumstances goes
for nothing, and the pin or pins must be replaced and the player’s
ball put upon the white-ball spot at the foot of the table or if
that be occupied, on the nearest unoccupied spot thereto. But
should two balls be in contact the player can play with either of
them, direct at the pins, and any count so made is good.</p>

<p>If a player, with one stroke, knocks down the four outside pins
and leaves the black one standing on its spot, it is called a Natural,
or <i><b>Ranche</b></i>, and under any and all circumstances it wins the
game.</p>

<p>When a player gets more than 31, he is <i><b>burst</b></i>, and he may
either play again immediately with the same ball he has in the
pool rack, starting at nothing of course, or he may take a new
ball. If he takes a new ball he may either keep it or keep his old
one, but he cannot play again until it comes to his turn.</p>

<h3>THE LITTLE CORPORAL.</h3>

<p>This game is the regular Three-Ball Carrom Game with a small
pin added, like those used in Pin Pool, which is set up in the
centre of the table. The carroms and forfeits count as in the regular
Three-Ball Game, but the knocking down of the pin scores five
points for the striker, who plays until he fails to effect a carrom or
knock down the pin. A ball must be hit by the cue-ball before
the pin can be scored; playing at the pin direct is not allowed. The
pin must be set up where it falls; but in case it goes off the table or
lodges on the top of the cushion it must be placed upon the centre
spot. The pin leaning against the cushion must be scored as
down, and when the pin lodges in the corner of the table, so that
it cannot be hit with the ball, it is to be set up on the centre spot.
One hundred points generally constitute a game, but any number
of points may be agreed upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SPANISH GAME OF BILLIARDS.</h3>

<p>This game is played in the South, California, and in Mexico and
Cuba, and is played with two white and one red ball, and five pins
placed similar to those in Pin Pool. The red ball is placed on the
red-ball spot, and the first player strikes at it from within the baulk
semicircle. The game is scored by winning and losing hazards,
carroms, and by knocking over the pins. It is usually played
thirty points up.</p>

<p>The player who knocks down a pin after striking a ball gains
<i>two</i> points, if he knocks down two pins he gains <i>four</i> points, and
so on, scoring two points for each pin knocked down. If he knock
down the middle pin alone he gains <i>five</i> points. The player who
pockets the red ball gains <i>three</i> points and two for each pin
knocked down by the same stroke. The player who pockets
the white ball gains two points, and two for each pin knocked
over with the same stroke. Each carrom counts two. The player
who knocks down a pin or pins with his own ball before striking
another ball loses two for every pin so knocked down. The
player who pockets his own ball without hitting another ball
forfeits three points; for missing altogether he forfeits one point.
The striker who forces his own ball off the table without hitting
another ball forfeits <i>three</i> points, and if he does so after making a
carrom or pocket he loses as many points as he would otherwise
have gained. The rules of the American Carrom Game, except
where they conflict with the foregoing rules, govern this game
also.</p>

<h3>BOTTLE POOL.</h3>

<p>The game of Bottle Pool is played on a pool table with one
white ball, the 1 and 2 ball, and pool-bottle. The 1 and 2 balls
must be spotted, respectively, at the foot of the table, at the left
and right diamond nearest each pocket, and the pool-bottle is
placed standing on its neck on the spot in the centre of the table,
and when it falls it must be set up, if possible, where it rests.</p>

<p>Carrom on the two object-balls counts 1 point; Pocketing the
1 ball counts 1 point; Pocketing the 2 ball counts 2 points; Carrom
from ball and upsetting bottle counts 5 points. The game
consists of 31 points. The player having the least number of
points at the finish of the game shall be adjudged the loser.</p>

<p>Any number of persons can play, and the rotation of the players
is decided as in ordinary pool. Player No. 1 must play with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
white ball from any point within the string at the head of the table,
at either the 1 or 2 ball at his option. The player who leads must
play at and strike one of the object-balls before he can score a
carrom on the pool-bottle. If a player carrom on the bottle from
either of the object-balls, in such a way as to seat the bottle on its
base, he wins the game, without further play.</p>

<p>Should the 1 or 2 ball in any way, during the stroke, touch the
bottle and the bottle is in the same play knocked over or stood on
its base by the cue-ball, the stroke does not count. If the player
forces the bottle off the table or into a pocket, the bottle must be
spotted on its proper spot in the centre of the table, the player
loses his shot and forfeits one point, and the next player plays.</p>

<p>A player who makes more than 31 points is burst, and must
start his string anew; all that he makes in excess of 31 points
count on his new string, and the next player plays.</p>

<h2 id="CHANCE_AND_PROBABILITY">CHANCE AND PROBABILITY.</h2>

<p>In calculating the probability of any event, the difficulty is not,
as many persons imagine, in the process, but in the statement of
the proposition, and the great trouble with many of those who dispute
on questions of chance is that they are unable to think
clearly.</p>

<p>The chance is either for or against the event; the probability is
always for it. The chances are expressed by the fraction of this
probability, the denominator being the total number of events
possible, and the numerator the number of events favourable. For
instance: The probability of throwing an ace with one cast of a
single die is expressed by the fraction ⅙; because six different
numbers may be thrown, and they are all equally probable, but
only one of them would be an ace. Odds are found by deducting
the favourable events from the total, or the numerator from the
denominator. In the example, the odds against throwing an ace
are therefore 5 to 1. The greater the odds against any event the
more <i><b>improbable</b></i> it is said to be, and the more <i><b>hazardous</b></i>
it is to risk anything upon it.</p>

<p>When an event happens which is very improbable, the person to
whom it happens is considered <i><b>lucky</b></i>, and the greater the improbability,
the greater his luck. If two men play a game, the
winner is not considered particularly lucky; but if one wanted
only two points to go out and the other wanted a hundred, the
latter would be a very lucky man if he won.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that luck is the only subject in the world
on which we have no recognised authority, although it is a topic of
the most universal interest. Strictly speaking, to be lucky simply
means to be successful, the word being a derivative of <i>gelingen</i>, to
succeed. There are a few general principles connected with luck
which should be understood by every person who is interested in
games of chance. In the first place, luck attaches to persons and
not to things. It is useless for an unlucky man to change the
seats or the cards, for no matter which he chooses the personal
equation of good or bad luck adhering to him for the time being
cannot be shaken off. In the second place, all men are lucky in
some things, and not in others; and they are lucky or unlucky in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span>
those things at certain times and for certain seasons. This element
of luck seems to come and go like the swell of the ocean.
In the lives of some men the tide of fortune appears to be a long
steady flood, without a ripple on the surface. In others it rises
and falls in waves of greater or lesser length; while in others it is
irregular in the extreme; splashing choppy seas to-day; a storm
to-morrow that smashes everything; and then calm enough to
make ducks and drakes with the pebbles on the shore. In the
lives of all the tide of fortune is uncertain; for the man has never
lived who could be sure of the weather a week ahead. In the
nature of things this must be so, for if there were no ups and
downs in life, there would be no such things as chance and luck,
and the laws of probability would not exist.</p>

<p>The greatest fallacy in connection with luck is the belief that
certain men <i>are</i> lucky, whereas the truth is simply that they <i>have
been</i> lucky up to that time. They have succeeded so far, but that
is no guarantee that they will succeed again in any matter of
pure chance. This is demonstrated by the laws governing <i><b>the
probability of successive events</b></i>.</p>

<p>Suppose two men sit down to play a game which is one of pure
chance; poker dice, for instance. You are backing Mr. Smith,
and want to know the probability of his winning the first game.
There are only two possible events, to win or lose, and both are
equally probable, so 2 is the denominator of our fraction. The
number of favourable events is 1, which is our numerator, and
the fraction is therefore ½, which always represents equality.</p>

<p>Now for the successive events. Your man wins the first game,
and they proceed to play another. What are the odds on Smith’s
winning the second game? It is evident that they are exactly the
same as if the first game had never been played, because there are
still only two possible events, and one of them will be favourable
to him. Suppose he wins that game, and the next, and the next,
and so on until he has won nine games in succession, what are the
odds against his winning the tenth also? Still exactly an even
thing.</p>

<p>But, says a spectator, Smith’s luck must change; because it is
very improbable that he will win ten games in succession. The odds
against such a thing are 1023 to 1, and the more he wins the more
probable it is that he will lose the next game. This is what gamblers
call the <i><b>maturity of the chances</b></i>, and it is one of the
greatest fallacies ever entertained by intelligent men. Curiously
enough, the men who believe that luck must change in some circumstances,
also believe in betting on it to continue in others.
When they are <i><b>in the vein</b></i> they will “follow their luck” in perfect
confidence that it will continue. The same men will not bet
on another man’s luck, even if he is “in the vein,” because “the
maturity of the chances” tells them that it cannot last!</p>

<p>If Smith and his adversary had started with an agreement to
play ten games, the odds against either of them winning any number
in succession would be found by taking
the first game as an even chance, expressed by
unity, or 1. The odds against the same
player winning the second game also would
be twice 1 plus 1, or 3 to 1; and the odds
against his winning three games in succession
would be twice 3 plus 1, or 7 to 1, and so on,
according to the figures shown in the margin.</p>

<p>That this is so may easily be demonstrated
by putting down on a sheet of paper the total
number of events that may happen if any
agreed number of games are played, expressing
wins by a stroke, and losses by a cipher.
Take the case of two games only. There are four different events
which may happen to Smith, as shown in the margin.
He may win both games or lose both; or he may win
one and lose the other, either first. Only one of these
four equally probable events being favourable to his
winning both games, and three being unfavourable, the
odds are 3 to 1 that he does not win both; but these
are the odds <i><b>before he begins to play</b></i>. Having
won the first game, there are only two events possible,
those which begin with a win, and he has an equal
chance to win again.</p>

<p>If the agreement had been to play three games, there would
have been eight possible events, one of which must happen but all
of which were equally probable. These are shown
in the margin. If Smith wins the first game, there
are only four possible events remaining; those in
which the first game was won. Of these, there are
two in which he may win the second game, and two
in which he may lose it, showing that it is still exactly
an even thing that he will win the second game.
If he wins the second game, there are only two possible
events, the first two on the list in the margin,
which begin with two wins for Smith. Of these he
has one chance to win the third game, and one to
lose it. No matter how far we continue a series of
successive events it will always be found that having won a certain
number of games, it is still exactly an even thing that he will win
the next also. The odds of 1023 to 1 against his winning ten
games in succession existed only before he began to play. After
he has won the first game, the odds against his winning the remaining
nine are only 511 to 1, and so on, until it is an even thing
that he wins the tenth, even if he has won the nine preceding it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span></p>

<p>In the statistics of 4000 coups at roulette at Monte Carlo it was
found that if one colour had come five times in succession, it was
an exactly even bet that it would come again; for in twenty runs
of five times there were ten which went on to six. In the author’s
examination of 500 consecutive deals of faro, there were 815 cards
that either won or lost three times in succession, and of these 412
won or lost out. In a gambling house in Little Rock a roulette
wheel with three zeros on it did not come up green for 115 rolls,
and several gamblers lost all they had betting on the eagle and O’s.
When the game closed the banker informed them that the green
had come up more than twenty times earlier in the evening. They
thought the maturity of the chances would compel the green to
come; whereas the chances really were that it would not come, as
it had over-run its average so much earlier in the evening. The
pendulum swings as far one way as the other, but no method of
catching it on the turn has ever yet been discovered.</p>

<p><i><b>Compound Events.</b></i> In order to ascertain the probability of
compound or concurrent events, we must find the product of their
separate probability. For instance: The odds against your cutting
an ace from a pack of 52 cards are 48 to 4, or 12 to 1; because
there are 52 cards and only 4 of them are aces. The
probability fraction is therefore 1/13. But the probabilities of drawing
an ace from two separate packs are 1/13 × 1/13 = 1/169, or 168 to 1
against it.</p>

<p>Suppose a person bets that you will not cut a court card, K Q or
J, from a pack of 52 cards, what are the odds against you? In
this case there are three favourable events, but only one can
happen, and as any of them will preclude the others, they are
called <i><b>conflicting events</b></i>, and the probability of one of them is
the sum of the probability of all of them. In this case the probability
of any one event separately is 1/13, and the sum of the three is
therefore 1/13 + 1/13 + 1/13 = 3/13; or ten to 3 against it.</p>

<p>In order to prove any calculation of this kind all that is necessary
is to ascertain the number of remaining events, and if their
sum, added to that already found, equals unity, the calculation
must be correct. For instance: The probability of turning a
black trump at whist is 13/52 + 13/52 = 26/52; because there are two black
suits of 13 cards each. The only other event which can happen is
a red trump, the probability of which is also 26/52, and the sum of
these two probabilities is therefore 26/52 + 26/52 = 52/52, or unity.</p>

<p>Another fallacy in connection with the maturity of the chances
is shown in betting against two successive events, both improbable,
one of which has happened. The odds against drawing two
aces in succession from a pack of 52 cards are 220 to 1; but after
an ace has been drawn the odds against the second card being an
ace also are only 16 to 1, although some persons would be mad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>
enough to bet 1000 to 1 against it, on the principle that the first
draw was a great piece of luck and the second ace was practically
impossible. While the four aces were in the pack the probability of
drawing one was 4/52. One ace having been drawn, 3 remain in 51
cards, so the probability of getting the second is 3/51, or 1/17. Before
a card was drawn, the probability of getting two aces in succession
was the product of these fractions; 1/13 × 1/17 = 1/221. On the same
principle the odds against two players cutting cards that are a tie,
such as two Fours, are not 220 to 1, unless it is specified that the
first card shall be a Four. The first player having cut, the odds
against the second cutting a card of equal value are only 16 to 1.</p>

<p><i><b>Dice.</b></i> In calculating the probabilities of throws with two or
more dice, we must multiply together the total number of throws
possible with each die separately, and then find the number of
throws that will give the result required. Suppose two dice are
used. Six different throws may be made with each, therefore
6 × 6 = 36 different throws are possible with the two dice together.
What are the odds against one of these dice being an
ace? A person unfamiliar with the science of probabilities would
say that as two numbers must come up, and there are only six
numbers altogether, the probability is 2/6, or exactly 2 to 1 against
an ace being thrown. But this is not correct, as will be immediately
apparent if we write out all the 36 possible throws with two
dice; for we shall find that only 11 of the 36 contain an ace, and
25 do not. The proper way to calculate this is to take the chances
against the ace on each die separately, and then to multiply them
together. There are five other numbers that might come up, and
the fraction of their probability is ⅚ × ⅚ = 25/36, or 25 to 11 in their
favour.</p>

<p>Take the case of three dice: As three numbers out of six must
come up, it might be supposed that it was an even thing that
one would be an ace. But the possible throws with three dice
are 6 × 6 × 6 = 216; and those that do not contain an ace are
5 × 5 × 5 = 125; so that the odds against getting an ace in one
throw with three dice, or three throws with one die, are 125/216, or 125
to 91 against it.</p>

<p>To find the probability of getting a given total on the faces of
two or three dice we must find the number of ways that the desired
number can come. In the 36 possible throws with two dice
there are 6 which will show a total of seven pips. The probability
of throwing seven is therefore 6/36, or 5 to 1 against it. A complete
list of the combinations with two dice were given in connection
with Craps.</p>

<p><i><b>Poker.</b></i> In calculating the probability of certain conflicting
events, both of which cannot occur, but either of which would be
favourable, we must make the denominator of our fraction equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span>
in both cases, which will, of course, necessitate a proportionate
change in our numerator. Suppose a poker player has three of a
kind, and intends to draw one card only, the odds against his getting
a full hand are 1/16; against getting four of a kind, 1/48. To find
the total probability of improvement, we must make the first fraction
proportionate to the last, which we can do by multiplying it
by 3. The result will be 3/48 + 1/48 = 4/48; showing that the total
chance of improvement is 1 in 12, or 11 to 1 against it.</p>

<p><i><b>Whist.</b></i> To calculate the probable positions of certain named
cards is rather a difficult matter, but the process may be understood
from a simple example. Suppose a suit so distributed that
you have four to the King, and each of the other players has three
cards; what are the probabilities that your partner has both Ace
and Queen? The common solution is to put down all the possible
positions of the two named cards, and finding only one out of
nine to answer, to assume that the odds are 8 to 1 against partner
having both cards. This is not correct, because the nine positions
are not equally probable. We must first find the number of possible
positions for the Ace and Queen separately, afterward multiplying
them together, which will give us the denominator; and
then the number of positions that are favourable, which will give
us the numerator.</p>

<p>As there are nine unknown cards, and the Ace may be any one
of them, it is obvious that the Queen may be any one of the remaining
eight, which gives us 9 × 8 = 72 different ways for the two
cards to lie. To find how many of these 72 will give us both cards
in partner’s hand we must begin with the ace, which may be any one
of his three cards. The Queen may be either of the other two,
which gives us the numerator, 3 × 2 = 6; and the fraction of probability,
6/72, = 1/12; or 11 to 1 against both Ace and Queen.</p>

<p>If we wished to find the probability of his having the Ace, but
not the Queen, our denominator would remain the same; but the
numerator would be the three possible positions of the Ace, multiplied
by the six possible positions of the Queen among the six
other unknown cards, in the other hands, giving us the fraction 18/72.
The same would be true of the Queen but not the Ace. To prove
both these, we must find the probability that he has neither Ace
nor Queen. There being six cards apart from his three, the Ace
may be any one of them, and the Queen may be any one of the remaining
five. This gives us 6 × 5 = 30, and the fraction 30/72. If we
now add these four numerators together, we have:&mdash;for both cards
in partner’s hand, 6; for Ace alone, 18; for Queen alone, 18; and
for neither, 30; a total of 72, or unity, proving all the calculations
correct.</p>

<p>In some of the problems connected with Whist, it is important
to know the probability of the suits being distributed in various
ways among the four players at the table; or, what is the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
thing, the probable distribution of the four suits in any one hand.
The author is indebted to Dr. Pole’s
“Philosophy of Whist” for these calculations.
As an example of the use of this
table, suppose it was required to find the
probability of any other player at the table
holding four or more trumps if you had six.
Take all the combinations in which the
figure 6 appears, and add together the
number of times they will probably occur.
That will be your denominator, 166. The
numerator will be the number of times that
the combinations occur which contain a
figure larger than 3, in addition to the 6.
This will be found to be 74, and the probability
will therefore be 74/166.</p>

<p><i><b>MARTINGALES.</b></i> Many gamblers
believe that as the science of probabilities
teaches us that events will equalise themselves
in time, all that is necessary is to
devise some system that will keep a person
from guessing, so that he may catch the
pendulum as it swings; and to add to it
some system of betting, so that he will have
the best of it in the long run. Some content
themselves with playing a “system”
against banking games, which is merely a
guide to the placing of the bets, the simplest
example of which would be to bet
always on heads if a coin was tossed a
thousand times, or to bet on nothing but
red at Roulette. Others depend more on
martingales, which are guides to the
amount of the bets themselves, irrespective
of what they are placed on.</p>

<p>The most common form of martingale is called <i><b>doubling up</b></i>,
which proceeds upon the theory that if you lose the first time and
bet double the amount the next time, and continue to double until
you win, you must eventually win the original amount staked. If
there was no end to your capital, and no betting limit to the game,
this would be an easy way to make money; but all banking games
have studied these systems, and have so arranged matters that
they can extend their heartiest welcome to those who play them.</p>

<p>In the first place, by simply doubling up you are giving the bank
the best of it, because you are not getting the proper odds. If you
double up five times you are betting 16 to 1; but the odds against
five successive events are 31 to 1, as we have already seen, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
bank should pay you 31 instead of 16. You should not only
double, but add the original amount of the stake each time, betting
1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, and so on. If you do this, you will win the
amount of your original stake for every bet you make, instead of
only for every time you win. This looks well, but as a matter of
fact doubling up is only another way of borrowing small sums
which will have to be paid back in one large sum when you can
probably least afford it.</p>

<p>Suppose the game is Faro, the chips five dollars a stack, and the
limit on cases twenty-five dollars. The limit on cases will then be
400 chips. If eight successive events go against your “system,”
which they will do about once in 255 times, your next bet will be
beyond the limit, and the banker will not accept it. At Monte
Carlo the smallest bet is a dollar, and the limit is $2,400. They
roll about 4,000 coups a week, and if you were to bet on every one
of them, doubling up, you would win about $1,865, one dollar at a
time, and would lose $4,092 simply through being unable to follow
your system beyond the limit of the game during the two or
three occasions, in the 4,000 coups, that your system would go
against you for eleven or more coups in succession. It is useless
to say it would not go against you so often, for probabilities teach
us that it would be more wonderful if it did not than if it did.</p>

<p>It must never be forgotten that the most wonderful things that
happen are not more wonderful than those that don’t happen. If
you tossed a coin a thousand times, and did not once toss heads
eight times in succession, it would be four times more surprising
than if you tossed heads ten times in succession.</p>

<p><i><b>Progression.</b></i> This is a favourite martingale with those who
have not the courage or the money to double up.
It consists in starting with a certain amount for the
first bet, say ten dollars, and adding a dollar
every time the bet is lost, or taking off a dollar
every time a bet is won. If the player wins as
many bets as he loses, and there is no percentage
against him, he gets a dollar for every bet he wins,
no matter how many bets he makes, or in what
order the bets are won and lost, so that the
number won equals the number lost. That this is
so may be easily demonstrated by setting down
on a sheet of paper any imaginary order of bets,
such as the ten shown in the margin, five of
which are won, and five lost; the net profit on
the five bets won being five dollars. No matter
how correctly the player may be guessing, and how
much the luck runs his way, he wins smaller and
smaller amounts, until at last he is “pinched off.” But if a long
series of events goes against him his bets become larger and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span>
larger, but he must keep up the progression until he gets even.
If ten bets go his way he wins $55; if ten go against him he
loses $145.</p>

<p>It is said that Pettibone made a fortune playing progression at
Faro, which is very likely, for among the thousands of men who
play it the probabilities are that one will win all the time, just as
the probabilities are that if a thousand men play ten games of
Seven Up, some man will win all ten games. At the same time it
is equally probable that some man will lose all ten.</p>

<p>Some players progress, but never pinch, keeping account on a
piece of paper how many bets they are behind, and playing the
maximum until they have won as many bets as they have lost.
Against a perfectly fair game, with no percentage and no limit,
and with capital enough to follow the system to the end, playing
progression would pay a man about as much as he could make in
any good business with the same capital and with half the worry;
but as things really are in gambling houses and casinos, all martingales
are a delusion and a snare. It is much better, if one
must gamble, to trust to luck alone, and it is an old saying that
the player without a system is seldom without a dollar. It is the
men with systems who have to borrow a stake before they can
begin to play.</p>

<p>Such matters as calculating the probability of a certain horse
getting a place, the odds against all the horses at the post being
given, would be out of place in a work of this kind; but those
interested in such chances may find rules for ascertaining their
probability in some of the following text books.</p>

<h2 id="TEN_PINS">TEN PINS.</h2>

<p>The standard American game of Ten Pins is played upon an
<i><b>alley</b></i> 41 or 42 inches wide, and 60 feet long from the head pin to
the foul or scratch line, from behind which the player must deliver
his ball. There should be at least 15 feet run back of the foul
line, and the gutters on each side of the alley must be deep enough
to allow a ball to pass without touching any of the pins standing
on the alley.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p660.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Diagram of the layout of the pins" />
</div>

<p><i><b>The Pins</b></i> are spotted as shown in the margin, the
centres 12 inches apart, and those of the back row
3 inches from the edge of the pit. The regulation
pins are 15 inches high, 2¼ diam. at the base, 15
inches circumference 4½ from the bottom, and 5¼ at the neck.
<i><b>The Balls</b></i> must not exceed 27 inches in circumference in any
direction, but smaller balls may be used.</p>

<p><i><b>Frames.</b></i> Each player rolls ten frames or innings, in each of
which he is supposed to have three balls, although as a matter of
fact he rolls two only. In match games, two alleys are used, and
the players roll one inning on each alternately.</p>

<p><i><b>A Strike</b></i> is made when all ten pins are knocked down with
the first ball of the innings, and it is scored on the blackboard
with a cross, the number of pins made with the three balls being
filled in afterward. <i><b>A Spare</b></i> is made when all ten pins are
knocked down with the two balls of one inning, and it is marked
with a diagonal stroke. If the player fails to get either a strike or
a spare, it is a <i><b>Break</b></i>, marked with a horizontal line, under
which is written the actual number of pins down. After each ball
is rolled any pins that have fallen on the alley are called <i><b>deadwood</b></i>,
and must be removed before the second ball is rolled.</p>

<p><i><b>Counting.</b></i> If a player makes a strike in one inning, all that
he makes on the next two balls rolled, whether in one inning or
not, counts also on the strike, so as to give him the total score on
three balls for the frame. Three successive strikes would give
him 30 points on the first frame, with a ball still to roll to complete
the second frame, and two balls to roll to complete the third.
If he got two strikes in succession, and 5 pins on the first ball of
the third frame, 4 on the second ball, the first frame would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span>
worth 25, the second frame 19, and the break on the third frame
9; making his total score 53 for the three frames.</p>

<p>If the player makes a spare in one inning, all the pins knocked
down by the first ball of the next inning count also on the spare.
Suppose a spare to be followed by a strike, the frame in which the
spare was made would be worth 20. If he made 5 pins only, the
spare would be worth 15.</p>

<p>Although the player is supposed to have three balls in each
inning, and is allowed to count all he makes on three balls if he
gets a strike or a spare, he is not allowed to roll three balls on a
break. It was formerly the custom to let him roll the third ball
on the chance of getting a break of 10. This was afterward
changed to giving him 10 pins, without rolling for them, if he got
9 on two balls; but the present rule is to call it a break if he does
not get a strike or a spare in two balls, and not to waste time in
rolling the third ball.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> Instead of putting down the amount made in each
inning, the total of the frame is added to the total of the previous
score, so that the last figure put down shows the total score up to
and including that frame. The following illustration shows the
total score of a player for ten innings. The top line of figures gives
the number of the frame. The second shows the number of pins
knocked down by each ball rolled, and the third line shows how
the scores would be actually put down on the blackboard, the
strike, spare, and break marks being placed above the figures.
With the exception of the second line of figures, which is put in
for purposes of illustration only, this might be a copy of an actual
score.</p>

<p>As the player made a spare on the last frame, he had another
ball to roll, on what was practically a new frame, with which he
made 9 pins.</p>

<p><i><b>Averages.</b></i> If a team is playing a match, and one of the
players is unavoidably absent, it is the custom to give him credit
for his average, according to the records of his previous games
during the tournament or the season. This is considered better
than appointing a substitute to play for him.</p>

<p>There are a great many varieties of Ten Pins, the most interesting
of which will be found described in the following Laws of
the game, which are reprinted here by the kind permission of the
Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co., from their 1908 edition of the
“Bowler’s Guide.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span></p>

<h3>BOWLING ALLEY LAWS.</h3>

<p class="center">RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE
GAME OF AMERICAN TEN PINS.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Revised at Louisville, Ky., March 19-21, 1906. In effect
Sept. 1, 1906.</i></p>

<p>The alleys upon which the game shall be played shall not be less
than 41 nor more than 42 inches in width. The length from the
centre of No. 1 pin spot to the foul line shall be 60 feet. Back of
the foul line there shall be a clear run of not less than 15 feet.
The pin spots shall be clearly and distinctly described on or imbedded
in the alleys and shall be so placed 12 inches apart from
centre to centre. They shall be 2¼ inches in diameter. The pin
spots numbered 7, 8, 9 and 10 shall be placed 3 inches from the pit
edge of the alleys, measuring from the edge to the centre of such
pin spots.</p>

<p>The pins shall be spotted on the pin spots placed upon the alleys
according to the following diagram, and the pins and spots shall be
known by the numbers as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/p662.jpg" width="250" height="140" alt="Diagram of the layout of the pins" />
</div>

<p>The pins shall be of the following design and measurements:
15 inches in height, 2¼ inches in diameter at their base, 15 inches
in circumference at a point 4½ inches from their base, 11⅝ inches
in circumference at a point 7¼ inches from their base, 5¼
inches in circumference at the neck, a point 10 inches from the
base; 8 inches in circumference at the head, a point 13½ inches
from the base. The taper from point to point shall be gradual,
so that all lines shall have a graceful curve.</p>

<p>The balls shall not in any case exceed 27 inches in circumference
nor exceed 16 pounds in weight. Any sized ball of less circumference
or weight may be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span></p>

<p>Two alleys immediately adjoining each other shall be used in all
games. The contesting teams shall successively and in regular
order roll one frame on one alley, and for the next frame alternate
and use the other alley, so alternating each frame until the game is
completed.</p>

<p>In delivering the ball the player must not permit any part of his
foot, while any portion thereof is in contact with the alleys, to rest
or extend on, over or beyond the foul line, nor shall any part of his
person be permitted to come in contact with any part of the alleys
beyond the foul line, at any time before the delivered ball shall
have reached the pins. A ball delivered contrary to the provisions
of this rule shall be a foul ball, and shall be so declared by the
umpire immediately such ball so becomes foul.</p>

<p>No count shall be made on a foul ball, and any pins which are
knocked down or displaced thereby shall be at once respotted. A
foul ball shall count as a ball rolled against the player.</p>

<p>Pins which are knocked down or displaced by a ball which leaves
the alley before reaching the pins, or from a ball rebounding from
the rear cushions, do not count, and they shall be immediately
respotted.</p>

<p>Every ball delivered, unless it be declared a dead ball by the
umpire, shall be counted against the player.</p>

<p>Pins which are knocked down by another pin rebounding in the
play from the side partition or rear cushion are counted as pins
down.</p>

<p>Pins which are knocked down or displaced from any cause except
by a fairly delivered ball shall in all cases be respotted.</p>

<p>Should a player by mistake roll on the wrong alley, or out of his
turn, or be interfered with in his play by another bowler or spectator,
or should any of the pins at which he is playing be displaced
or knocked down in any manner before his delivered ball reaches
the pins, or should his ball come in contact with any foreign obstacle
on the alleys, then the ball so delivered by him shall be
immediately declared a dead ball by the umpire, and such ball
shall not count, and shall be immediately re-rolled by the player
after the cause for declaring such ball dead has been removed.</p>

<p>Pins which are knocked down by a fair ball, and which remain
lying on the alley or in the gutters, are termed dead wood, and shall
be removed before the next ball is rolled.</p>

<p>Should a standing pin fall by removing dead wood, such pin or
pins shall be at once respotted.</p>

<p>Should a pin be broken or otherwise badly damaged during the
game, it shall be at once replaced by another as nearly uniform
with the set in use as possible. The umpire shall in all such cases
be the sole judge in the matter of replacing such pin or pins.</p>

<p>Each player shall roll two balls in each frame except when he
shall make a strike, or when a second strike or spare is made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span>
the tenth frame, when the player shall complete that frame by rolling
a third ball. In such cases the frame shall be completed on
the alley on which the first strike or spare is made.</p>

<p>A strike is made when the player bowls down the ten pins with
his first ball delivered in any frame and is credited and designated
in the score by an X in the upper right hand corner of the frame,
and the count in such frame is left open until the player shall have
rolled his next two balls, when all pins made, counting ten for a
strike, shall be credited therein.</p>

<p>A spare is made when the player bowls down all the pins with
his second ball in any frame, and is credited and designated with
/ in the upper right hand corner of the frame in which it is made.
The count in such frame is left open until such player shall roll his
next ball in the succeeding frame, when the number of pins rolled
down thereby shall be added to the ten represented by his spare,
and the total shall be credited therein.</p>

<p>A break is made in all cases where the player does not secure
either a strike or a spare in a frame, and in such cases only the
number of pins knocked down are credited in the frame where the
break is made.</p>

<p>If at the end of the tenth frame the team scores shall be a tie,
another frame shall be immediately bowled, and play is so continued
until at the close of even frames one of the teams shall
have a greater number of pins than their opponents, which shall
conclude the game.</p>

<h3>COCKED HAT.</h3>

<p>The game is played with a head pin and the right and left corner
pins as shown in the following diagram:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/p664.jpg" width="250" height="140" alt="Diagram of the layout of the pins" />
</div>

<p>Balls not exceeding six inches must be bowled, and they must
be rolled down the alley (not cast or thrown). The rules of American
Ten Pins except in St. Louis, where there is a special association
with local rules, generally govern this game also, with the
exception of three balls instead of two to the frame, but strikes and
spares count three instead of ten, and each pin counts one as in
Ten Pins. If the bowler knocks down three pins with the ball
which is first bowled, in any frame in the game of Cocked Hat, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
a strike, and counts three, and is marked on the blackboard the
same as in Ten Pins. What pins the bowler knocks down in the
second frame with his first two balls must be reckoned as in Ten
Pins, i.e., one for each pin bowled down, which pin or pins must
be added to the strike and placed to the credit of the player in the
inning where the strike was scored (the strike being computed as
three); such strike must be added to pins knocked down with the
two succeeding spare balls; thus, should the bowler score a strike,
and should he in the next new frame knock down but one pin with
his two spare balls, the strike and pin scored must be computed as
4&mdash;the strike counting 3 and the pin 1.</p>

<p>Poodles, or balls rolled down the gutter, are fair balls, and any
pin or pins which they may get must be counted and placed to the
credit of the bowler; dead wood is removed from the alley, and any
pins knocked down through dead wood remaining on the alley cannot
be placed to the credit of the bowler. The maximum number
which can be bowled is 90.</p>

<h3>COCKED HAT AND FEATHER.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/p665.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="Diagram of the layout of the pins" />
</div>

<p>The pins are spotted as above, the centre pin being the feather.</p>

<p>Ten innings constitute a game, and three balls (not exceeding 6
inches in size) must be used in each inning.</p>

<p>All the pins except the feather have to be bowled down or the
inning goes for naught.</p>

<p>If the feather is left standing alone, the innings count one.</p>

<p>There are no penalties. The dead wood must be removed.
Any pins knocked down through dead wood remaining on the alley
cannot be placed to the credit of the bowler.</p>

<p>The maximum is 10.</p>

<h3>THE BATTLE GAME.</h3>

<p class="center">THE PINS ARE SET UP THE SAME AS FOR THE GAME OF
TEN PINS.</p>

<p>Four or six innings constitute a battle or game, except in the
case of a tie, when another inning is played. In case that inning
should result in a tie also, still another inning is played&mdash;in fact,
until the scores are unequal. In any inning where a tie occurs the
score stands over until the next inning, when each point is counted
double. If the two innings result in a tie, the score is tripled.
Should the total score result in a tie, sufficient innings are played
to make the grand score unequal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span></p>

<p>The team having the largest score in the previous inning must
bowl the first ball, so that the weaker party will have the last ball.</p>

<p>Three balls of regulation size (27 inches in circumference) or
under are allotted to each player in each inning.</p>

<p>Each pin bowled down counts 1, including the king pin.</p>

<p>If all the pins except the king pin are bowled down, it counts 12.</p>

<p>The pins are set up as soon as the nine pins are knocked down,
or the king pin is the only one left standing.</p>

<p>The alleys are changed alternately.</p>

<p>The dead wood is removed after each ball is rolled.</p>

<p>In case of uneven teams the Dummy or Blind is filled by any
substitute the captain may pick out to bowl. He can select any
one of his men he chooses, without regard to rotation, or he himself
can bowl, but no man can take the place of the blind twice
until every member of the team has acted as the substitute.</p>

<p>Poodles count as balls rolled. Any pin or pins knocked down
by such balls are set up again in their former positions.</p>

<p>A rebounding ball does not count, and any pin or pins knocked
down by it are set up, as in the case of a poodle ball.</p>

<p>When a ball has left the hand and touched the alley, it goes as
a rolled ball.</p>

<h3>NINE UP AND NINE DOWN.</h3>

<p class="center">THE PINS ARE SET UP THE SAME AS FOR THE GAME OF
AMERICAN TEN PINS.</p>

<p>Three balls (not exceeding 6 inches in size) are bowled in each
inning.</p>

<p>The player must knock down a single pin, which counts 1; then
with two remaining balls he endeavors to leave one pin standing,
which counts 1. Failure to do either, the inning goes for nothing.</p>

<p>No penalties are attached. Dead wood must be removed. Any

<h3>THE NEWPORT GAME.</h3>

<p class="center">THE PINS ARE SET UP THE SAME AS FOR THE GAME OF
AMERICAN TEN PINS.</p>

<p>Three balls (not exceeding 6 inches in size) are allowed in each
inning.</p>

<p>Ten frames constitute a game. The object of the game is to
bowl down an exact number of pins from 1 to 10, but not necessarily
in routine order. The player who, in ten innings, scores the
least number of winning innings is the loser. For instance: A
bowls down 2, 5, 7, 8 and 10; B bowls down 1, 6, 8 and 9. Here
B loses, as A has one more inning to his credit than B.</p>

<p>Note.&mdash;As the larger number of pins are easy to obtain, the
superior skill lies in picking out the small numbers. For this
reason the pony ball is used, and the small numbers are the points
of attack from the start. When the player has bowled down a
certain number of pins corresponding with any score he has made,
and his remaining ball or balls will be of no avail, an (X) is placed
under that number, indicating that the inning goes for naught, as
he has already made that score.</p>

<p>Only one score is allowed to each inning. Players alternate in
the use of alleys.</p>

<p>Balls bounding from the cushions go for naught.</p>

<h3>DUCK PIN GAME.</h3>

<p class="center">THE PINS ARE SPOTTED THE SAME AS THE AMERICAN GAME
OF TEN PINS.</p>

<p>A regulation Duck Pin shall be 9 inches high, 1½ inches in
diameter at the top, 3½ inches in diameter at the body of the pin,
and 1⅜ inches in diameter at the base; shall taper gradually from
the bottom to the largest part of the body, and shall be as near
uniform in weight as possible.</p>

<p>No ball exceeding 4½ inches in diameter can be used in games.</p>

<p>Each player to roll three balls to each frame, and each player to
roll two frames at a time.</p>

<p>A line shall be drawn ten feet beyond the regular foul line, and
any ball delivered beyond the first named line shall be declared
foul.</p>

<p>All other rules of the American Bowling Congress govern.</p>

<h3>KINSLEY CANDLE PIN.</h3>

<p>The Count&mdash;Two balls shall be allowed for frame.</p>

<p>Strikes&mdash;A strike is credited when a player bowls over the ten
pins with the delivered ball.</p>

<p>Spares&mdash;A spare is credited whenever a player clears the alley
with the first and second ball.</p>

<p>Breaks&mdash;A break is charged to a player at all times when neither
a strike nor spare is made.</p>

<p>The Ball&mdash;The ball shall not exceed 5½ inches in diameter in
any direction, but smaller balls may be used.</p>

<h3>A FEW DON’TS.</h3>

<p>Don’t try to learn in a day.</p>

<p>Don’t use too much speed at first.</p>

<p>Don’t grip the ball too tight.</p>

<p>Don’t loft the ball.</p>

<p>Don’t play the side ball until you have mastered the centre
delivery.</p>

<p>Don’t swing the ball more than once before delivering it.</p>

<p>Don’t start with a jump; walk one and run two steps.</p>

<p>Don’t deliver the ball with the right foot in front.</p>

<p>Don’t step on or over the foul line.</p>

<p>Don’t think you can change the course of the ball after it has
left your hand.</p>

<p>Don’t expect a “strike” every time you hit the head pin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span></p>

<p>Don’t blame the pin boys if you get a split. They will spot any
pin you call their attention to.</p>

<p>Don’t throw away a “spare” because you think you were entitled
to a “strike.”</p>

<p>Don’t use any unnecessary motions.</p>

<p>Don’t exert yourself. Take it easy. A slow accurate ball is
better than a swift wild one.</p>

<p>Don’t put your whole thumb in the finger hole. One joint is
enough.</p>

<p>Don’t use a large finger hole. Big holes make a ball lop-sided.</p>

<p>Don’t roll a ball down the alley when there is a ball in the pit.</p>

<p>Don’t use a wide grip if you have a small hand, or two narrow
for a big hand.</p>

<p>Don’t use chalk on your shoes. It not only cracks the leather,
but leaves the runway in bad condition for whoever follows you.</p>

<p>Don’t think your wrist is gone if it hurts after bowling a few
games. Change your grip and throw the strain somewhere else.</p>

<p>Don’t bend your back when delivering the ball. With your
feet far apart and knees bent you can start the ball with little or no
sound.</p>

<p>Don’t be superstitious&mdash;13 is a better start than 12.</p>

<p>Don’t think it necessary to be a Sandow. Many lightweights
bowl well.</p>

<p>Don’t get discouraged, you can learn. Any able-bodied person,
with ordinary nerve and a good eye, can become quite expert with
little practice.</p>

<p>Don’t let an alley owner use pins that are worn out.</p>

<p>Don’t think you can sandpaper a ball without injuring it. It
takes an expert mechanic to true up a lignum-vitæ ball.</p>

<p>Don’t lay a lignum-vitæ ball away DRY, if you don’t want it to
crack.</p>

<h2 id="GENERAL_LAWS">GENERAL LAWS, FOR ALL CARD GAMES.</h2>

<p>Very few games have their own code of laws, and only one or
two of these have the stamp of any recognised authority. In
minor games, questions are continually arising which could be
easily settled if the players were familiar with a few general principles
which are common to the laws of all games, and which
might be considered as the basis of a general code of card laws.
The most important of these principles are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i><b>Players.</b></i> It is generally taken for granted that those first in
the room have the preference, but if more than the necessary
number assemble, the selection must be made by cutting. A
second cut will then be required to decide the partnerships, if any,
and the positions at the table, the latter being important only in
games in which the deal, or some given position at the table, is an
advantage or the reverse. The usual method of cutting is to
spread the cards face downward on the table, each player drawing
one. In some games the cards are thrown round by one of the
players.</p>

<p><i><b>Shuffling, Cutting and Dealing.</b></i> In all games in which
the cards are shuffled at all, each player has the right to shuffle,
the dealer last. In English speaking countries the cards are always
cut by the player on the dealer’s right, who is called the
“pone.” In cutting to the dealer in any game there must be as
many cards left in each packet as will form a trick; or, if the game
is not one of tricks, as many cards as there will be in any player’s
hand; four, for instance, at Whist, and five at Poker. The cards
are always distributed to each player in rotation from left to right,
and each must receive the same number of cards in the same
round. In games in which the cards are dealt by two and threes,
for instance, it is illegal to give one player two and another three
in the same round.</p>

<p><i><b>Misdeals.</b></i> In all games in which the deal is an advantage, a
misdeal loses the deal; but in all games in which the deal is a disadvantage,
or some position is more advantageous than that of the
dealer, such as the “age” at Poker, a misdeal does not lose the
deal. The only exception to this rule is in Bridge, in which there
are no misdeals, and Cribbage, which has a fixed penalty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Bidding.</b></i> In all games in which there is any bidding for the
privilege of playing or of making the trump, or any betting on the
value of the hands, the privilege must be extended to each player
in turn, beginning on the dealer’s left. Any bid or any bet once
made can neither be taken back nor amended. If any bid is made
out of turn in any partnership game, it must be assumed that undue
information is conveyed, and the player in error, or his partner,
must lose his bid. In round games there is no penalty.</p>

<p><i><b>Exposed Cards.</b></i> No player can exact a penalty for his own
error, so that if an adversary of the dealer exposes one of his own
cards he cannot claim a misdeal, but the dealer’s side may. There
should be no penalty for a player’s having exposed a card unless
he can derive some benefit from the exposure, such as from his
partner’s having seen it. If there is no partner, there should be
no penalty, because the player injures himself only. All exposed
cards must be left on the table, and may be called upon by the
adversaries to be led or played.</p>

<p>The same principles apply to <i><b>Leading out of Turn</b></i>. If the
player in error has no partner, or his partner is a dummy, and the
lead is taken back, no harm is done except to the player himself,
and there should be no penalty. If the adversaries fail to observe
that the lead was irregular, they are equally at fault with the
player, who must be assumed to have erred unintentionally. In
games in which a lead out of turn conveys information to a partner,
the usual penalty is to call a suit.</p>

<p>If a player is led into error through a previous error on the part
of an adversary, he should not suffer any penalty for it, but may
take back his card. This is particularly true of following suit to
erroneous leads, or playing after a revoke which is afterward
amended.</p>

<p><i><b>Irregularities in the Hands.</b></i> In all games in which the
player need not follow suit unless he chooses, such as Seven-up,
there should be no penalty if the player has not his full complement
of cards, because he cannot possibly gain anything by playing
with a short hand. But in all such games as Whist, where the
absence of a card in plain suits might enable a player to trump, a
penalty must be enforced for playing with less than the proper
number of cards. In all such games as Poker, it is only to the
player’s own disadvantage to play with too few cards, provided he
is not allowed to call four cards a flush or a straight, and there
should be no objection to his playing with a short hand. Many
good players “squeeze” their cards, and if they find a good pair
in the first two, they put up the ante without looking further. It
is manifestly unfair to bar them out of the pool because the dealer
has given them only four cards, which gives them no possible
advantage, but rather the reverse. This is in accordance with
common sense, and is the law in Cribbage and Piquet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Discrimination.</b></i> No person should be allowed any advantage
over another which is not compensated for in some way. In
Seven-up, for instance, the non-dealer counts game if it is a tie; an
advantage which is offset by the dealer’s counting Jack if he turns
it. In Auction Pitch the dealer has no such advantage, because
no trump is turned, and therefore the non-dealer cannot count ties
for game. It is a common error among Cassino players to hold
that a player cannot build on his own build, but that his adversary
may do so. A player holds two deuces, an Eight and a Ten, and
builds a Six to an Eight. It is claimed that an adversary may
increase this build to ten, but the original builder may not. This
is manifestly unfair, because there is no compensating advantage
to the player that is denied the privilege to justify its being allowed
to his adversary.</p>

<p><i><b>Benefiting by Errors.</b></i> No player should be allowed to win
a game by committing a breach of the laws. If a person revokes,
for instance, there is a certain penalty, but in addition to the penalty
it is always stipulated that the revoking player cannot win the
game that hand.</p>

<p><i><b>Double Penalties.</b></i> No person can be subjected to two penalties
for one offence. If a player leads out of turn, and a suit is
called, the card played in error cannot be also claimed as exposed
and liable to be called. If a player revokes, and his adversary wins
ten tricks, the revoke penalty adds three tricks to the ten already
won; but these thirteen tricks will not entitle the player to score
any points for a slam, because that would be exacting a double
penalty; the tricks for the revoke, and the points for the slam.</p>

<p><i><b>Intentional Error.</b></i> In all games it must be assumed that
the player’s intentions are honest, and that any errors that arise
are committed through inadvertence. Some of our law-makers
have attempted so to adjust their codes as to provide against the
manœuvres of the blackleg. This is simply impossible. Laws
are made for gentlemen, and when it is obvious that a player does
not belong to that class the remedy is not to appeal to the laws of
the game for protection, but to decline to play with him.</p>

<p><i><b>Etiquette.</b></i> It should be quite unnecessary to legislate against
acts which annoy or do injustice to individuals, but there should be
some provision in the laws of every game which will secure to
each individual equal rights with others in the enjoyment of the
game. Some games are especially selfish; Boston, for instance,
in which the four players originally forming the table may monopolise
the game for the entire evening, without offering newcomers
any chance to cut in. All such games should be limited to a certain
number of tournées, at the conclusion of which fresh candidates
should be allowed to cut into the table.</p>

<h3>DRIVE WHIST.</h3>

<p>There are several methods of playing Drive Whist; the most
popular being to fill as many tables as possible with the players
that present themselves, regardless of any order further than that
partners should sit opposite each other. The players may select
their own partners, or they may be determined by lot, according
to the decision of the hostess.</p>

<p>Straight whist is played; the cards being shuffled and cut afresh
for every hand. Each deal is a game in itself.</p>

<p><i><b>Drawing for Partners.</b></i> If there is an equal number of
ladies and gentlemen, and the number is less than fifty-two, a
sufficient number of red and black cards should be sorted out,
and the ladies asked to draw from the red, the men from the
black; those getting the same denominations being partners. For
instance: 16 couples present themselves for play. The thirteen
Hearts and the A 2 3 of Diamonds should be put into one hat
for the ladies; the thirteen Clubs, and A 2 3 of Spades being
put into another for the men. Those drawing the same denomination
of Hearts and Clubs, or of Spades and Diamonds are
partners.</p>

<p>Before play begins, the number of hands which it is proposed
to play should be announced, or a time set for adjournment.</p>

<p><i><b>Driving.</b></i> There is no rank attached to the tables, but they
should be arranged in such a manner that players may know
which table to go to next. The partners seat themselves
wherever they please, and at the tap of the bell at the head of
the table the deal is cut for, and play begins. The winners of
the majority of the thirteen tricks at each table go to the next
table. Here they may either continue to play as partners, or
may divide, which ever has been the style of play decided upon
by the hostess. When the partnerships have been drawn for,
it is usual to preserve them for the evening.</p>

<p>The losing gentleman at each table has the deal for the next
hand.</p>

<p><i><b>Scoring.</b></i> Every hand must be played out for all it is worth,
both winners and losers scoring all the tricks they take. If the
same partners play together throughout the evening, one score-card
will do for the couple. If they divide, each individual must
have his or her own score-card. The winners are those who
have taken the greatest number of tricks in the agreed number
of hands, or during the time limit. When partners divide as they
drive on, there should be two prizes, one for ladies, and one for
gentlemen.</p>

<h3>BID WHIST.</h3>

<p>This is a popular game on trains, or wherever it may be necessary
to stop at the end of a deal without finishing the game.
Thirteen cards are dealt to each player, one at a time, but no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[688]</a></span>
trump is turned. Partners sit opposite each other, and the
player to the left of the dealer makes the first bid.</p>

<p><i><b>BIDDING.</b></i> The bidding goes round until no one will go
any higher. The eldest hand starts by naming the number of
points he will make if allowed to name the trump and lead to
the first trick, but he does not name the suit he purposes picking
out. It is not necessary to lead a trump.</p>

<p>There are two ways to bid. In some places there are seventeen
points to be played for in each deal; one for each trick of
the thirteen and one for each of the four honours, ace king
queen and jack, in the trump suit. Honours count to the side
winning them, and not to the original holders, so that a player
holding the four top honours in any suit could safely bid eight;
four tricks and four honors being a certainty, but if that was
all he made he would lose on the deal, as the other side would
score nine points out of the seventeen.</p>

<p>In other places, it is the rule that the bidder must make the
odd trick or he cannot count honours or anything else. There
are then only eleven points to be played for in each deal; seven
odd tricks and four honours. Any player bidding four would
have to win the odd and three honors, or two odd and two
honours, or something to make up his bid.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> No matter how many more than his bid he
makes, he can score it all. If he fails, he is set back the amount
of his bid. If his adversaries win the odd trick or more, they
count one point for each trick over the book in addition to the
amount by which they set the bidder back.</p>

<p>When there are seventeen points in play each deal, it is usual
to take the lower score from the higher and score the difference
only, but when the bidder fails, he is not set back, but simply
gets nothing at all, while his opponents score all they make,
without any deductions.</p>

<h3>NORWEGIAN WHIST.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> This variety of whist is played with a full pack of
fifty-two cards, which rank from the A K Q down to the deuce.
In cutting, the ace is low.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Four persons cut for partners, the two highest
playing against the two lowest, the lowest cut having the choice
of seats and cards and dealing the first hand.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> The cards shuffled and cut, thirteen are given
to each player, one at a time in rotation to the left. No trump
is turned, as every hand is played without a trump.</p>

<p><i><b>MISDEALING.</b></i> In case of any irregularity in the deal,
the same dealer must deal again. The laws governing misdeals
are the same as at whist or bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>OBJECTS OF THE GAME.</b></i> The play is for tricks
alone, but whether the players try to win them or to lose them
depends on the declaration. In Grands it is to win; in Nullos,
it is to lose.</p>

<p><i><b>BIDDING.</b></i> The player to the left of the dealer makes the
first bid. He may offer to play grand or nullo or he may pass.
The moment either grand or nullo is named, the bidding ends.
If the first player passes, the next to the left must declare himself.
If all pass without a bid, the hand is played as a nullo.
Any player bidding out of turn loses 20 points, and is barred
from bidding on that deal.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> If the game is grand, the
player to the <i>right</i> of the bidder leads any card he pleases.
If the game is nullo, the player to the <i>left</i> of the bidder
leads. If no bid is made, the player to the left of the dealer
leads. Either partner may take in the tricks won by his side,
keeping them separate, so that they may be easily counted.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> The game is 50 points. Each trick over the
first six counts four in grands, but in some places only two in
nullos. This must be agreed upon before play. Tricks over
the book count for the bidder’s side in grands, but against him in
nullos. If the bidder and his partner fail to get the odd trick
in a grand, his opponents count double for each trick they win
over the book, but in nullos there is no double value.</p>

<p><i><b>PENALTIES.</b></i> In case of a revoke, the side in fault gives
three tricks to its opponents in grands, or receives three if it is
a nullo. The penalty for a lead out of turn is to call a suit.</p>

<h3>RUM.</h3>

<p>There are several varieties of this game, and quite a number
of ways of playing them, but the standard method, as adopted
by the best clubs, is that here given. The principal divisions
of the game are those played with the single pack, and those
played with the double pack and two jokers.</p>

<h3>SINGLE-PACK RUM.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> The full pack of fifty-two cards is used, ranking
from the K Q J down to the ace, the suits having no rank.
The ace may also be used in sequence with the king as the top
of a sequence.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Any number from two to six may play, but
four or five makes the best game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[690]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> The cards are spread and drawn for choice of
seats and first deal. The lowest cut has first choice, the next
lowest sitting on his left and so on round the table.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> When two play, ten cards are given to each.
When three play, seven to each. When four play, six to each.
The cards are dealt one at a time until all are helped and the
next card is turned face up on the table as a starter for the
discard pile. The stock is left beside this card, face down.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECT OF THE GAME.</b></i> The aim of the players is
to get rid of the cards dealt them and those they draw from
the stock by laying face upward on the table any combinations
of three of a kind, or three in sequence and suit.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The player to the left of the
dealer begins by taking into his hand the card that is face up,
if it suits him, or the top card of the stock. If he takes the
top of the stock, he puts it into his hand without showing it.
He may then lay out any combination of three cards that he
holds, but he is not obliged to do so. Whether he lays out
anything or not, he must discard a card, face up, to take the
place of the one drawn. This discard is always placed beside
the stock, and of course covers up any card already there.</p>

<p><i><b>LAYING OUT.</b></i> After drawing from the stock and before
discarding, a player may lay out any three cards, but no more
than three at one time. Or he may add one card from his
hand to any combination already laid out by another player,
but he cannot add more than one card in this way. He may add
a card to a combination laid out by himself if he wishes to.</p>

<p><i><b>CALLING OUT.</b></i> Each player in turn to the left draws,
lays out and discards in this manner until some player gets
rid of his last card, when he calls out, and the game comes to
an end. The last card in a player’s hand may be got rid of
by laying it out in combination, or by discarding it if it is the
only card left.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> As soon as any player calls out it is too late
for any other player to lay down any combinations he may hold.
Each player in turn to the left shows his hand and the winner
gets credit for the pip value of his cards, jacks being worth 11,
queens 12, kings 13.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that the stock is exhausted before any
player calls out. In this case the discards are turned face down
without shuffling them and the pile drawn from as if it were
the stock.</p>

<p><i><b>SPLASHES.</b></i> The game is sometimes played with the condition
that if any player chooses to risk holding his hand until
he can lay it all down at once, or lay down all but the one
which he is allowed to discard, he wins double from each of
the others. This prompts a player with a good hand to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[691]</a></span>
it up for a round or two on the chance of getting down a
splash, but the player who sees there is no chance for him
should get rid of as many cards as he can before the splash
comes, and in many cases some player will get rid of all his
cards in two or three rounds, and win without a splash.</p>

<h3>POKER RUM.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> In this variety of the game, the A K Q J are worth
ten points each, the ace eleven, and the remaining cards their
face value. The ace may be used as the top of a sequence
Q K A, or the bottom of A 2 3, but not as part of a round-the-corner,
K A 2.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> Ten cards are always given to each player,
no matter how many are in the game. If there are more than
three at the table, the double pack must be used, so as to leave
cards enough for the stock.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECT OF THE GAME.</b></i> The aim of the player is
to draw cards from the stock or discard pile until the pip value
of the unmatched cards in his hand amounts to 15 or less.
Sequences may run to any length, and four, five, or six of a
kind is in order. The cards in hand that do not fit any combination
of three or more are deadwood, and the object is to
reduce this deadwood to less than fifteen.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> Each player in turn to the
left of the dealer draws a card from the stock or the discard
pile and discards one in its place, face up. No player is allowed
to lay down anything until he can show his whole hand, and
then only when his deadwood is fifteen or less, and he is not
obliged to lay down even then if he prefers to wait until he can
reduce his deadwood still further.</p>

<p><i><b>THE SHOW-DOWN.</b></i> As soon as any player can show
down his hand, the game is at an end. He lays out his combinations
and pushes them aside. Then he announces the pip
value of his deadwood, after discarding a card in place of the
one drawn. Suppose he draws the seven of hearts, and lays
down the 6 7 8 9 of that suit; J Q K of clubs; discards the king
of spades and leaves two deuces and a five for his deadwood.
That is nine points.</p>

<p>Each of the other players in turn to the left then lays down
his hand and pushes aside all combinations held. If the pip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[692]</a></span>
value of his deadwood is more than that of the player calling
for the show-down, he pays the difference. If any player has
less than the caller, then he is the winner, and each one at the
table pays him, the caller paying him double as a penalty. In
case of ties for low, they divide the losses of the others.</p>

<h3>POKER GIN.</h3>

<p>This is a variety of poker rum in which the deadwood must
not exceed ten points and each player is allowed not only to put
aside his own combinations after the call for a show-down comes,
but may add any of his odd cards to the combinations laid out
by the one who calls for a show-down.</p>

<p>Suppose that in the example given for poker rum, the caller
showing 6 7 8 9 of hearts, J Q K of clubs, and nine in his
deadwood, another player has in his ten cards the 7 8 9 of
diamonds; 6 7 8 of spades, two fours and the tens of clubs and
hearts.</p>

<p>When the show-down is called for, he has twenty-eight points
in his deadwood; but by adding his club ten to the caller’s
sequence of J Q K, and the heart ten to the caller’s 6 7 8 9 in
that suit, he reduces his deadwood to eight points, the pair of
fours, and beats the caller out by a point.</p>

<p><i><b>PENALTIES.</b></i> If any player turns out to have less in his
deadwood than the caller, as in the example just given, the caller
forfeits ten points to him, in addition to having to pay for
the difference. Should a player call for a show-down when he
has more than ten in his deadwood, he loses five points to each
of the others at the table and takes up his cards again.</p>

<h3>DOUBLE-PACK RUM.</h3>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> This game is always played with two full packs
of fifty-two cards each and two jokers, all shuffled together and
used as one. The ace may be high or low in sequences.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> Ten cards are given to each player, one at a
time, and the next card is turned up and laid beside the stock
to start the discard pile.</p>

<p><i><b>LAYING OUT.</b></i> Sequences in suit may run to any length,
and any number of cards or combinations may be laid out at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[693]</a></span>
one time. Five, six or seven of a kind may be shown, and four
of a kind may be of any suits. There is no obligation to lay
out anything, but the player who lays out can do so only in
his proper turn, after drawing a card. He may add as many
cards as he pleases to any combinations already on the table,
either of his own or other players.</p>

<p><i><b>THE JOKERS.</b></i> These two cards have peculiar privileges.
A joker may be called anything the holder pleases. If it is
used as the interior of a sequence, such as <i>6</i> joker 8 of hearts,
it must remain there, but if it is placed at the end of a sequence,
any player has the right to remove it to the other end, placing
it crossways, to show that it has been moved, provided he can
put a card in its place, or add one to the sequence below the
joker. A joker once moved cannot be moved again.</p>

<p>Suppose some player has laid out the 6 7 joker of clubs. The
joker stands for the 8 of clubs. Another player holding the
actual 8 of clubs could move the joker to the position of the
5 and add his 8. Or if he had the 4 of clubs, he could move
the joker to represent the 5 and add his 4 to the sequence, or
he might add both 8 and 4 if he held those cards.</p>

<p>On account of the privilege of laying out as many cards at
a time as the player pleases, and adding as many as he can to
other combinations, this is a much livelier game than the ordinary
single-pack rum. The settling is the same, the winner
getting the pip value of each player’s hand. In case no one
has all his cards down before the stock is exhausted, which is
very unusual, however, the discards are turned face down and
drawn from again.</p>

<h3>CANFIELD.</h3>

<p>This form of solitaire is often confused with Klondike, but
there is a marked difference both in the layout and the play.</p>

<p>The full pack of fifty-two cards is used. After it has been
thoroughly shuffled and properly cut, thirteen cards are counted
off, face down, and placed at the player’s left, face up. This
is the stock. The fourteenth card is then turned face up and is
the foundation for that deal. Let us suppose it is a seven. It
is placed by itself, furthest from the player, waiting for the
three other sevens to appear to form three other foundations,
each in a different suit.</p>

<p>Four cards are then dealt off from left to right, face up, for
the layout. Holding the remaining thirty-four cards in the
left hand, face down, the player counts off three at a time and
turns them face up on the table, but so that the top card only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[694]</a></span>
is seen. If this card can be used, the card under it is available.
If not, the three are left on the table and three more turned
up in the same way.</p>

<p>Let us suppose this is the appearance of the table:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/p694.jpg" width="400" height="270" alt="The Foundation:&mdash; 🂷 The Stock:&mdash; 🃔 The Layout:&mdash; 🃖 🃁 🂢 🂹 The top card of the three:&mdash; 🃅" />
</div>

<p>The player can make several changes at once. The five of
diamonds will go on the club six, the club four on the five, the
ace of diamonds on the deuce of spades, leaving a space which
must be filled from the top of the stock, using the card that
was under the four of clubs. Another card is exposed and
available under the five of diamonds.</p>

<p>Cards built on the foundations must be in the same suit, and
build upward, nothing but eights being available on the sevens.
On the layout, sequences are built down, and must change colour
each time. Any time that there is a space in the four columns
of the layout, the top card of the stock may be used to fill the
space, but the stock itself must never be added to. If there are
only two cards in any of the four columns of the layout at any
time, and the top one can be used on another pile, it may be
taken for that purpose. Suppose the nine of hearts were built
on down to a black six, the five of diamonds could be removed
to that pile to release the six of clubs.</p>

<p>After running through the entire pack, three cards at a time,
the cards that have not been used in the process, and which are
lying on the table face up, are taken up again and turned face
down, without shuffling them, and run through again, three
at a time. As long as any card can be used it must alter the
run of the cards that will turn up in threes after that, and the
player may continue to go through the pack in this way until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[695]</a></span>
he is stopped by being unable to use any card that shows at the
top of the three he turns up.</p>

<p>The betting is against the player getting eleven cards in his
foundation piles. If the pack is purchased for $52, he gets $5
for every card in his foundations. It is almost impossible to
get out the whole fifty-two for $260, but it is done occasionally.</p>

<h3>I DOUBT IT.</h3>

<p>This is a good round game, any number taking part. The
full pack of fifty-two cards is dealt round, one card at a time
as far as it will go equally, the remainder being left in the
centre of the table, face down. Any one can deal.</p>

<p>The player to the left of the dealer starts the game by taking
from his hand any three cards he pleases and laying them on
the table in front of him face down. He then announces,
“These are three jacks,” or anything he likes to call them, there
being no obligation to tell the truth about it, so the cards might
actually be a six four and a deuce.</p>

<p>Each player in turn to the left can doubt the statement that
the cards are three jacks, or he can pass. If any player in his
proper turn says, “I doubt it,” the three cards are at once
turned face up. If the statement is not correct, the three cards
are at once taken back into the player’s hand, together with
all the cards lying face down in the centre of the table at the
time. Should the statement turn out to be true, the player who
doubted it must take the three jacks and all the cards on the
table.</p>

<p>That settled, the next player to the left lays out three cards
and announces that they are three of a kind of something or
other, each player to the left passing or doubting it. If no one
questions the correctness of a statement, no explanation is given
by the player who laid out the cards. He simply pushes them
to the centre of the table with the others, face down. If he
shows them, or any one of them, as some may do in a spirit of
bravado, he must take all three back into his hand and all on
the table with them. The object of doubting is simply to prevent
a player from getting rid of three cards, but toward the end of
the game one must be careful, as triplets are gradually gathered
for that stage.</p>

<p>If any player has less than three cards in his hand when it
comes to his turn to lay down, he must draw from the table,
face down, enough to make three. He may look at what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[696]</a></span>
draws before announcing. If there are no cards on the table,
he must pass his turn.</p>

<p>The first to get rid of all his cards gets a chip from each of
the others for each card they hold.</p>

<h3>JASS.</h3>

<p>This is popularly supposed to be the progenitor of the American
game of pinochle, and is still very popular in Switzerland.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> Jass is played with the thirty-six card pack, the
5 4 3 2 of each suit being thrown out. The cards rank from
the A K Q down to the 6, both in cutting and in play. The
cards have a pip value in scoring, aces 11, tens 10, kings 4,
queens 3 and jacks 2. In the trump suit, the jack is the highest
card, and is worth 20 points instead of 2. The nine of trumps
comes next, being worth 14 points, and is called “Nell.” The
remaining trumps rank as in plain suits.</p>

<p>The jack of trumps has the special privilege of being allowed
to renege, even when the holder of the jack can follow suit.</p>

<p><i><b>MARKERS.</b></i> The score is usually kept on a slate.</p>

<p><i><b>PLAYERS.</b></i> Any number from two to four can take part,
but each is always for himself. The rules for two-hand differ
slightly from those for three or four. (See Two-hand Jass.)</p>

<p><i><b>CUTTING.</b></i> The first deal is cut for, high wins. The cards
rank as in plain suit, and ties cut again, to decide the tie.</p>

<p><i><b>DEALING.</b></i> When the pack is cut, at least four cards must
be left in each packet. (In Switzerland they cut to the left and
deal to the right; but in America this is not necessary.) The
cards are dealt three at a time for three rounds, so that each
player receives nine cards. When four play, the last card must
be turned up for the trump. When three play, the twenty-eighth
card is the trump.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECT OF THE GAME.</b></i> The play is to win tricks
with cards of pip value in them, especially aces and tens, called
game points, and also to meld certain combinations of cards that
are found in the player’s hand.</p>

<p>When three play, the dealer may exchange his nine cards for
the nine that are left on the table, but he must surrender the
turned up trump among those nine cards to any player that
holds the six. If the dealer does not wish to exchange, each
player in turn to the left may do so. In making the exchange,
no card of the nine originally dealt to the player may be kept,
not even the six of trumps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[697]</a></span></p>

<p>The pip value of the cards won in tricks count for the player
at the end of the hand. The following values are for the melds:</p>

<table summary="Values of the cards">
  <tr>
    <td>Four jacks are worth</td>
    <td class="tdr">200</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Four aces, kings, queens, or tens</td>
    <td class="tdr">100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Five cards of any suit in sequence</td>
    <td class="tdr">100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Four cards of any suit in sequence</td>
    <td class="tdr">50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Three cards of any suit in sequence</td>
    <td class="tdr">20</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>King and queen of trumps</td>
    <td class="tdr">20</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The melds are made after the player has played his card to
the first trick, whether he wins that trick or not, but the melds
are not credited to him on the slate unless he wins at least one
trick during the play of the hand.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> When four play it is sometimes
permissible for one to pass out, each in turn to the left
having the right. The first thing is for the holder of the six
of trumps to exchange it for the turned-up trump. The player
to the left of the dealer then leads any card he pleases, and
each player in turn must follow suit and must head the trick if
he can; by trumping if he has none of the suit led. As soon as
a card is played, the player makes his meld, announcing its pip
value. The winner of the last trick scores five points for it.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> Sometimes 1,000 points is a game, as in pinochle,
and the first player to call out wins if he is correct; if not he
loses. Sometimes in three or four-hand, it is agreed to play
some number of deals divisible by four, usually 12 or 16. These
are indicated by cross marks on the slate, each arm representing
a deal. The two players with the higher scores at the end of
the hand each rub off a mark and the one who is first to rub off
all his marks is the winner, or the last to wipe off is stuck, according
to agreement. Any one failing to get as many as 21
points in meld and play is set back a mark.</p>

<h3>TWO-HAND JASS.</h3>

<p>When only two play, the game closely resembles American
pinochle, the winner of each trick drawing a card from the top
of the stock, the loser drawing the next one. All melds are
made immediately after winning a trick and before drawing
from the stock, only one meld at a time being allowed. It is
not necessary to follow suit to anything until the stock is exhausted,
after which all melds cease and the second player to
each trick must win it if he can, but the jack of trumps still
has the privilege of renouncing if a plain suit is led.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[698]</a></span></p>

<h3>PATIENCE POKER</h3>

<p>As its name implies, this is a form of solitaire, but it may be
managed so as to provide a pleasing competition for any number
of players. Both forms of the game will be described, the
solitaire first.</p>

<p><i><b>CARDS.</b></i> The full pack of fifty-two cards is shuffled and cut.
Keeping it face down in the left hand, the top card is turned
up and laid upon the table. The next card is turned up and laid
in such a position that it touches the first one, either on one of
its four edges, or one of its four corners. The third card must
touch one or other of the two already on the table in the same
manner, and so on until twenty-five cards have been drawn and
placed, but the twenty-five must be so arranged as to form a
square of five cards each way.</p>

<p>As no card can be moved from its original position, as soon as
there are cards enough in either direction, up and down, or
from left to right, to make a row of five, no more cards can be
laid beyond that point, as it would transgress the limits of the
square.</p>

<p><i><b>OBJECT OF THE GAME.</b></i> The aim of the player is to
place each card as it comes from the top of the pack in the most
advantageous position for combining with other cards, either already
there or hoped for, so that each row of five cards, up and
down, or right to left, shall be a poker hand of some value.</p>

<p><i><b>VALUE OF THE HANDS.</b></i> The various hands possible
in poker are given a counting value, supposed to be in proportion
to the difficulty of getting them. There are three systems
of counting in common use, the English differing slightly from
the American, both in value and in rank. The various scoring
values are here given:</p>

<table summary="The scoring values in different systems of counting">
  <tr>
    <td>One pair</td>
    <td class="tdr">2</td>
    <td class="tdr">1</td>
    <td class="tdr">1</td>
  </tr>

    <td class="tdr">20</td>
    <td class="tdr">5</td>
    <td class="tdr">5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Full hands</td>
    <td class="tdr">25</td>
    <td class="tdr">12</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Four of a kind</td>
    <td class="tdr">50</td>
    <td class="tdr">20</td>
    <td class="tdr">16</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Straight flush</td>
    <td class="tdr">75</td>
    <td class="tdr">30</td>
    <td class="tdr">30</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Royal flush</td>
    <td class="tdr">100</td>
    <td class="tdr">50</td>
    <td class="tdr">30</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The first column given is the American system of counting by
fives, after one pair, retaining the regular poker rank of the
hands. The second column is the American system that puts
the straight next to the full hand, and the flush between two
pairs and a triplet. The third column is the English system,
which ranks the straight above the full hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[699]</a></span></p>

<p>As no person has as yet come forward with any figures to
show which combination is easier to get in patience poker, nor
the proportion of one hand to the other, these figures are all
guess work; and players may adopt any values they please.</p>

<p>As soon as the tableau is complete, with five rows of five
cards each, the value of each of the ten hands the tableau contains
is found and the total put down. The object of the solitaire
player usually is to see how many tableaus he needs to
reach a grand total of 500 points.</p>

<p><i><b>SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD PLAY.</b></i> Experience has
shown that it pays to keep certain classes of hand in one section,
either left to right or up and down. Many players put all the
flushes in the vertical columns, and build the pairs, triplets and
fours from right to left. Straights are uncertain quantities
unless they are flush also and are seldom played for.</p>

<p>Each card has a double value, and it may help to make up two
hands of high scoring power, if well placed. The highest possible
point value for a tableau would probably be five hands
of four of a kind and five straight flushes, four of which would
be royal, like this:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p733.jpg" width="300" height="375" alt="🂱 🃑 🃁 🂡 🃉 | 🂾 🃞 🃎 🂮 🃈 | 🂽 🃝 🃍 🂭 🃇 | 🂻 🃛 🃋 🂫 🃆 | 🂺 🃚 🃊 🂪 🃅" />
</div>

<p>The odds against the cards coming from the stock in such
order as to make a tableau like this possible would be enormous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[700]</a></span>
but there are many sets of twenty-five cards that can be rearranged
so as to make a much higher count than that actually
arrived at in the solitaire. The player’s skill consists in anticipating
the possibilities that certain cards will be drawn and
in so arranging his table that if the hoped for card comes out,
the most advantageous place will be found open for it.</p>

<p><i><b>TWO OR MORE PLAYERS.</b></i> Any number can play
this game, the only limitation being the number of packs available
and space enough on the table for each one to lay out his
own tableau. One player is selected as the “caller” and he
shuffles his pack and presents it to be cut. In the meantime each
of the others sorts his individual pack into sequence and suit,
so as to be able to pick out any named card without unnecessary
delay.</p>

<p><i><b>METHOD OF PLAYING.</b></i> The caller starts by taking
off his top card and placing it face up on the table, at the same
time announcing aloud its suit and rank, as “Seven of clubs.”
This makes it unnecessary for the others to watch the cards the
caller draws.</p>

<p>Each player picks out his seven of clubs and places it on the
table in front of him, face up, as a starter for his tableau. Suppose
the next card called is the ten of diamonds. As each player
can place that card in any one of eight different positions with
regard to the seven of clubs, and the next card after that in any
one of a dozen positions, it must be evident that although the
twenty-five cards called will be the same for every tableau, the
resulting poker combinations may be vastly different.</p>

<p><i><b>SCORING.</b></i> Each player is credited with the value of his
tableau, and then the duty of being caller passes to the left.
The game is at an end when an agreed number of deals have
been played, or at the expiration of a specified time, the highest
total score being the winner.</p>

<h3>SOLITAIRE CRIBBAGE.</h3>

<p>This game may be played by one person or by several, two to
four making an interesting game, either as partners or each for
himself.</p>

<p>The individual player takes a full pack of fifty-two cards,
shuffles and cuts, and deals off three for himself, two for his
crib, and then three more for himself. Taking up the six, he
sorts them and discards for the crib, just as if the two cards
already there had been laid off by an opponent. The pack is
then cut for the starter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[701]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no play, and the hand is turned up and counted, scoring
it on a regular cribbage board. The crib is then counted
and scored. Leaving the starter still face up on the top of the
pack, the eight cards in hand and crib are thrown aside. For
the next deal, the player gives himself three cards from the top
of the pack, one of which was the starter on the last deal, then
two for the crib and three more for himself, discarding for the
crib, cutting a starter, counting and scoring hand and crib as
before.</p>

<p>This is continued until only four cards are left, one of them
being the starter for the last deal. Turn up these four cards
and count them as a hand.</p>

<p>The game is usually 91 points, and the object of the solitaire
player is to see if he can reach the game hole without going
through the pack more than once. If he does not reach with
six hands and cribs, each with a starter, and one hand of four
cards without a starter, he has failed to get the solitaire.</p>

<p><i><b>WHEN TWO OR MORE PLAY.</b></i> The object is now
to see which player or partnership can get the greatest number
of points in going through the pack once, each playing his own
solitaire with his individual pack, but keeping level with his
opponents in the matter of hands and deals.</p>

<p>It is usual for each to cut the starter for the other and then
to verify the count of the other’s hands and cribs. If one
reaches 91 before the other gets round past 60, it is reckoned
as a double game. If neither side reaches 91 before the pack
runs out, the player that comes nearer to it wins. When two
play against two as partners, each takes an adversary and plays
against him individually, the scores being balanced at the end
by adding those of the partners together.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
